Typically, a common assumption used in visual tracking is that the raw video sequences are clear, while real-world data is with significant noise and irrelevant patterns. Consequently, the learned features may be not all relevant and noisy. To address this problem, we propose a novel visual tracking method via a point-wise gated convolutional deep network (CPGDN) that jointly performs the feature learning and feature selection in a unified framework. The proposed method performs dynamic feature selection on raw features through a gating mechanism. Therefore, the proposed method can adaptively focus on the task-relevant patterns (i.e., a target object), while ignoring the task-irrelevant patterns (i.e., the surrounding background of a target object). Specifically, inspired by transfer learning, we firstly pre-train an object appearance model offline to learn generic image features and then transfer rich feature hierarchies from an offline pre-trained CPGDN into online tracking. In online tracking, the pre-trained CPGDN model is fine-tuned to adapt to the tracking specific objects. Finally, to alleviate the tracker drifting problem, inspired by an observation that a visual target should be an object rather than not, we combine an edge box-based object proposal method to further improve the tracking accuracy. Extensive evaluation on the widely used CVPR2013 tracking benchmark validates the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5004979", "pubmed_id": "27575684", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0161808", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2516655681", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["823678", "53303450", "6094550", "5378407", "16135648", "32010544", "1295945", "15962241", "8713986", "13958466", "207763512", "393948", "10112350", "1622067", "342957", "13028371", "973101", "5648267", "17615903", "1188600", "1660289", "6795574", "8290524", "11832048", "30608954", "8281525", "10288645", "208933582", "10519006", "14397939", "6194123", "1241368", "7532761", "17567954", "11962297", "10355303", "7487588", "6821810", "12008458", "10702897"], "inbound_citations": ["147704695", "61156483", "39358603", "35266138"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17436450"}

Despite of remarkable success of GAN in image super resolution, it suffers from the major problem of poor perceptual quality. While employing a GAN for super resolution, it tends to generate over-smoothed images that lacks high frequency textures and do not look natural. We propose an intuitive generalization to Generative Adversarial Network and its conditional variations to address the problem of image super-resolution and improves the test quality of images. DGAN is a diverse GAN architecture incorporating multiple generators and a single discriminator. The main intuition is to employ multiple generators, instead of using a single one as in the original GAN. To enforce that multiple generators produce diverse samples, the discriminator trains a loss function to distinguish between real and fake samples by designed margins, and multiple generators alternately produce realistic samples by minimizing their losses. In fact, this paper addresses 2 main challenges; recovering realistic texture low resolution images and speed up the training process. We perform extensive experiments and compare the proposed model with other variants of GAN to demonstrate the efficiency and stability of the proposed model in both quantitative and qualitative benchmarks.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.image.2019.02.008", "venue": "Signal Process.

However, the detector performance has been significantly degenerated due to the low resolutions of satellite images, as well as the limited training data. In this paper, a robust domain-adaptive vehicle detection framework is proposed to bypass both problems. Our innovation is to transfer the detector learning to the high-resolution aerial image domain, where rich supervision exists and robust detectors can be trained. To this end, we first propose a super-resolution algorithm using coupled dictionary learning to \"augment\" the satellite image region being tested into the aerial domain. Notably, linear detection loss is embedded into the dictionary learning, which enforces the augmented region to be sensitive to the subsequent detector training. Second, to cope with the domain changes, we propose an instance-wised detection using Exemplar Support Vector Machines (E-SVMs), which well handles the intra-class and imaging variations like scales, rotations, and occlusions.

Solubility is an independent characteristic of a protein which can be determined using amino acid compositions under specific experimental conditions. The present study aims at the prediction of protein solubility by adapting machine learning based approaches using the primary structure information. The features involve amino acid compositional features as well as the physiochemical properties of the amino acids i.e. canonical value, hydrophobicity, solubility index and solubility score. For a dataset of 6372 protein sequences (4850 soluble protein sequences and 1522 insoluble protein sequences), all the four features were calculated. Using the calculated values, four different prediction models were developed based on Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC). For performance evaluation, MCC, F-measure, accuracy, precision and recall rate are determined. Among all the four prediction models, MLP has been observed to be the most accurate model for the prediction of protein solubility with an accuracy rate of 95.92%, followed by RF and NBC. The proposed model, based on MLP, can be used for predicting protein solubility as a preprocess of experimental predictions.

However, choosing an efficient kernel or feature mapping function is strongly dependent on data structure. Thus, a flexible feature mapping can be confidently applied in different types of data structures without challenging a kernel selection and its tuning. This paper introduces a new flexible feature mapping approach based on the Dirichlet distribution in order to develop an efficient SVM for nonlinear data structures. To determine the parameters of the Dirichlet mapping, a tuning technique is employed based on the maximum likelihood estimation and Newton's optimization method.

The paper analyze the distribution of conditional expenditure to a set of sociodemographic, travel, contextual and satisfaction variables applying non-linear regression techniques with Lasso penalty and nonparametric techniques such as Random Forest. The empirical results show that the key variables that determine the average spending of cruise tourists are their residence and the port of arrival of the cruise.

The digital number (DN) in remotely sensed multispectral images is considered as a random variable when judging the allocation of unknown pixels into predefined training classes. If an unknown pixel shows a similar DN vector as the pixels in a training class, it will increase the global entropy defined as the sum of DN probabilities multiplied by the logarithm of DN probabilities for all pixels within the training class. The unknown pixel is to be assigned to the class for which the entropy of the training class is increased most due to the inclusion of the pixel. The proposed entropy-based classification (EC) is compared with the maximum likelihood classification (MLC), parallelepiped classification, minimum distance classification, Mahalanobis distance classification (MDC), iterative self-organizing data analysis technique (ISODATA) classification, and K-means classification. These classifiers were applied to a Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus image covering Houston, Texas, USA, acquired on October 16, 1999. A reference land cover map from the National Land Cover Data 2001 of the same area was taken as a ground reference to assess the accuracy of classification results, suggesting that the EC showed comparable overall accuracy as MDC, and they both outperformed other classifiers.

A major risk factor for C. difficile infection (CDI) is prior exposure to antibiotics as they increase susceptibility to CDI by altering the membership of the microbial community enabling colonization. The importance of the gut microbiota in providing protection from CDI is underscored by the reported 80-90% success rate of fecal microbial transplants in treating recurrent infection. Adaptive immunity, specifically humoral immunity, is also sufficient to protect from both acute and recurrent CDI. However, the role of the adaptive immune system in mediating clearance of C. difficile has yet to be resolved. Using murine models of CDI, we found that adaptive immunity is dispensable for clearance of C. difficile. However, Random Forest analysis using only 2 members of the resident bacterial community correctly identified animals that would go on to clear the infection with 66.7% accuracy. These findings indicate that the indigenous gut microbiota independent of adaptive immunity facilitates clearance of C. difficile from the murine gastrointestinal tract. Importance C. difficile infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients in the United States. Currently the role of the adaptive immune response in modulating levels of C. difficile colonization is unresolved. This work suggests that the indigenous gut microbiota is a main factor that promotes clearance of C. difficile from the GI tract. Our results show that clearance of C. difficile can occur without contributions from the adaptive immune response.

Missing data may represent a serious problem since they can affect the reliability of measured variables in specific locations. To which extent and according to which methodology a gap in time series should be filled is a major research challenge. In this study, the time-series of meteorological data relative to 13 monitoring sites from the ICP-Forest network in Italy were analysed with the aim to define the minimum number of site-specific observations, which can be considered adequate for further analysis on forest resource management. Three main climatic variables were taken into account in the analysis: air temperature, relative humidity and total precipitation. By using an increasing proportion of available data, descriptive and inferential statistic methods were applied to evaluate the amount of variability along the period of analysis (1998-2013) and associated error of estimation at seasonal level. The relative importance of each factor accounted in our analysis (season, year, variable, plot, sampling proportion) was investigated fitting a Random Forest model on the results of the bootstrapping procedure. Air temperature was the variable with a marked seasonal profile and the easiest to be represented at monthly level on a specific time period. Humidity and precipitation were more stable across the analysed time period. Trends in precipitation showed that a high amount of variability could be detected only when > 80% of valid observations were available. Humidity showed an intermediate pattern, with an exponential increase in the amount of explained variability when using an increased proportion of sampled observations. Random Forest Regression models indicated sampling proportion (i.e., number of available observations) as an important factor for trend analysis of relative air humidity and precipitation. We conclude that monthly or seasonal statistics can be proficiently estimated for both air temperature and relative humidity with a proportion of missing values higher than 50%. Conversely, a reliable analysis of intra-seasonal or intra-monthly precipitation variability requires a much higher amount of observations. In the latter case gap filling represents the only feasible solution.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3832/ifor2427-010", "venue": null, "journal": "Iforest - Biogeosciences and Forestry", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2741033581", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["4644754", "73717948", "56487873", "140619903", "27566399", "59153759", "10415241", "124500405", "88780086", "36738385", "90412996", "11403364", "54007027", "90141722", "206944239", "125742245", "153920310", "157851853", "55220386", "14837524", "28845682", "206162141", "129652176", "45920215", "9013929", "24233420"], "inbound_citations": ["203654108", "91333702", "145022090", "202626078", "55499841"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54728340"}

The results revealed that comparing the resonant frequency and amplitude by using a microphone as a sensor allowed non-cracked eggs to be distinguished from cracked eggs.

In support of decision making, the current situation must first be assessed by answering the basic questions what and where through detailed and accurate resource mapping. ::: In this study, only discrete LiDAR datasets were utilized. Corresponding orthophotos were used only for training and validation. Land cover classification was done using two workflows using Support Vector Machines (SVM) as the classifier. In the first workflow, land cover classes were classified using rasterized point cloud metrics such as minimum, maximum, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, quartile average, mode and median. In the second workflow, point cloud analysis was used to derive additional features for classification which was integrated and executed in the same object-based software through Cognition Network Language (CNL). The derivations of the additional features were conducted after running an initial segmentation which means that the distribution of points was analysed within the delineated objects. Classes that benefited to point cloud-based metrics are mostly non-ground agricultural classes namely coconut, mango and palm trees. These classes have obtained increase in accuracies by an average of 11.2% using validation sample set 1 and an average of 18.2% using validation sample set 2.

Fusion has been shown to be most effective when the models have some complementary strengths arising from different approaches. In this work, we fuse the results from four common but methodologically different nonlinear multivariate models (Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Self-Organizing Maps) that were trained to predict radiation-induced pneumonitis risk on a database of 219 lung cancer patients treated with radiotherapy (34 with Grade 2+ postradiotherapy pneumonitis). Each model independently incorporated a small number of features from the available set of dose and nondose patient variables to predict pneumonitis; no two models had all features in common. Fusion was achieved by simple averaging of the predictions for each patient from all four models. Since a model\u2019s prediction for a patient can be dependent on the patient training set used to build the model, the average of several different predictions from each model was used in the fusion (predictions were made by repeatedly testing each patient with a model built from different cross-validation training sets that excluded the patient being tested). The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for the fused cross-validated results was 0.79, with lower variance than the individual component models. From the fusion, five features were extracted as the consensus among all four models in predicting radiation pneumonitis.

Spectroscopic tools are often used to provide point measurements at key points in the process. Here we demonstrate the applicability of Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) to continuous nuclaetion processes. The objective of the work described here was to show how HSI can be used to monitor mixing processes by providing spatially discriminated near-infrared spectra, yielding vital process information that has only previously been estimated using simulation techniques such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Methods: Water (antisolvent) and an IPA/water mixture (solvent) containing dissolved paracetamol seed crystals were mixed in a tube by introducing the antisolvent jet at different flow rates, and the resulting mixing in the tube was imaged with an InnoSpec RedEye camera in the spectral range 950 to 1700 nm. Microscope images of the resultant crystals from each different flow rate were taken to confirm that differences in the final crystal product were observed. Machine learning techniques in the form of Support Vector Machine (SVM) analysis were used to analyse and automatically separate the spectral data of the solvent/antisolvent mix into the different components. Results: The antisolvent jet, which resulted in nucleation near the point of injection, could clearly be identified and therefore monitored after application of the SVM. Differences between different flow rates and concentrations were observed from the hyperspectral images obtained, and these differences carried through to the shape and size of the final crystals obtained.

Support vector machines (SVMs) are advantageous in that they provide a maximum margin of separation for the classification hyperplane. A new method for constructing classification trees, for which the branches comprise SVMs, has been devised. The novel feature is that the distribution of the data objects is used to determine the SVM encoding. The variance and covariance of the data objects are used for determining the bipolar encoding required for the SVM. The SVM that yields the lowest entropy of classification becomes the branch of the tree. The SVM-tree classifier has the added advantage that nonlinearly separable data may be accurately classified without optimization of the cost parameter C or searching for a correct higher dimensional kernel transform. It compares favorably to a regularized linear discriminant analysis, SVMs in a one against all multiple classifier, and a fuzzy rule-building expert system, a tree classifier with a fuzzy margin of separation.

Mature lymphocytes, uncommitted progenitor cells, promyelocytes, mature monocytes and mature neutrophils can be reproducibly identified as distinct clusters of events in heterogeneous, maturing bone marrow specimens. Support Vector Machines were used to identify the reference populations in order to reduce subjective bias in manually defining boundaries of these populations since they were not discretely separated from the remainder of the cells. Reference populations were identified in 50 randomly selected bone marrow aspirates obtained over a period spanning 3 years and 6 months from pediatric patients following chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The quantitative expression of gene products (cell surface antigens) and light scattering characteristics on these stressed specimens were demonstrated to be tightly regulated both within individuals and between individuals. Within an individual most gene products (CD45, CD34, CD14, CD16, CD64, CD33) demonstrated limited variability with a standard deviation of 0.25 log units. Surprisingly, with the exception of CD33, the variation of the mean intensities of each antigen between individuals was even less than the variation within an individual. These data confirm that the amounts of gene products expressed on normal developing cells are highly regulated but differ in intensities between different lineages and during the maturational pathway of those lineages. The amounts of gene products expressed at specific stages of development of each lineage are a biologic constant with minimal variation within or between individuals. \u00a9 2016 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5132067", "pubmed_id": "27754578", "doi": "10.1002/cyto.a.22999", "venue": "Cytometry", "journal": "Cytometry", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2534000784", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["206909237", "43079549", "22393817", "11483669", "25791652", "33083219", "46125608", "7090035", "27497927", "8662464", "38294193", "19804564", "45975994", "31728880", "41107707", "43122888", "33738625", "27084176", "22266070", "10120679"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15229909"}

Alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is one of the leading causes of chronic liver diseases and mortality in Western countries and Asia. Ultrasound image assessment is most commonly and widely used to identify the Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). It is one of the faster and safer non-invasive methods of NAFLD diagnosis available in imaging modalities. The diagnosis of NAFLD using biopsies is expensive, invasive, and causes anxiety to the patients. The advent of advanced image processing and data mining techniques have helped to develop faster, efficient, objective, and accurate decision support system for fatty liver disease using ultrasound images. This paper proposes a novel feature extraction models based on Radon Transform (RT) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). First, Radon Transform (RT) is performed on the ultrasound images for every 1 degree to capture the low frequency details. Then 2D-DCT is applied on the Radon transformed image to obtain the frequency features (DCT coefficients). Further the 2D-DCT frequency coefficients (features) obtained are converted to 1D coefficients vector in zigzag fashion. This 1D array of DCT coefficients are subjected to Locality Sensitive Discriminant Analysis (LSDA) to reduce the number of features. Then these features are ranked using minimum Redundancy and Maximum Relevance (mRMR) ranking method. Finally, highly ranked minimum numbers of features are fused using Decision Tree (DT), k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Fuzzy Sugeno (FS) and AdaBoost classifiers to get the highest classification performance. In this work, we have obtained an average accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 100% in the detection of NAFLD using FS classifier. Also, we have devised an integrated index named as Fatty Liver Disease Index (FLDI) by fusing two significant LSDA components to distinguish normal and FLD class with single number.

SVM classification system for each family is trained from representative enzymes of that family and seed proteins of Pfam curated protein families. The classification accuracy for enzymes from 46 families and for non-enzymes is in the range of 50.0% to 95.7% and 79.0% to 100% respectively. The corresponding Matthews correlation coefficient is in the range of 54.1% to 96.1%. Moreover, 80.3% of the 8,291 correctly classified enzymes are uniquely classified into a specific enzyme family by using a scoring function, indicating that SVM may have certain level of unique prediction capability.

Depending on the strong fitting ability of the generative adversarial network model, the distribution of deformation camouflage spot pattern can be directly fitted, thus simplifying the process of spot extraction and reproduction. The requirements of background spot extraction are analyzed theoretically. The calculation formula of limiting the range of image spot pixels is given and two kinds of spot data sets, forestland and snowfield, are established. Spot feature is decomposed into shape, size and color features, and a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) framework is established. The effects of different loss functions on network training results are analyzed in the experiment. In the meantime, when the input dimension of generator network is 128, the balance between sample diversity and quality can be achieved. The effects of sample generation are investigated in two aspects. Subjectively, the probability of the generated spots being distinguished in the background is counted, and the results are all less than 20% and mostly close to zero. Objectively, the features of the spot shape are calculated and the independent sample T-test is applied to verify that the features are from the same distribution, and all the P-Values are much higher than 0.05. Both subjective and objective methods prove that the spots generated by this method are similar to the background spots.

The last thirty years have been dominated by the classical view that human cognition is analogous to symbolic computation in digital computers. Connectionism proposes a different picture, inspired by the neural architecture of the brain: the mind is the result of the activity of immense numbers of simple units (akin to neurons) connected together in complex patterns or networks. On the classical account, information is represented by strings of symbols, just as we represent data in computer memory or (for that matter) on pieces of paper.

In this article, the proposed method based on EEG signals aimed to assess driver fatigue by using multi-entropy measures and compare the performance with channel combination and multiple classifiers. Given that EEG signals are unstable and non-linear, that using several common entropy evaluators to analyze EEG is more appropriate, including spectral entropy, approximate entropy, sample entropy and fuzzy entropy. In this paper, unlike other methods using whole electrodes and single classifier, the influence of channel combination on fatigue detection is discussed, and three types of common classifiers including Random Forest, Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbor are applied for classifying driver fatigue, implying that a comprehensive comparison is deeply discussed among them.

Global and local damages in the structures are segmented using Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering method. Geometrical features and Zernike Moments (ZM) are calculated from the delineated regions. The performance of the features is tested using Support Vector Machine classifier. Results show that the FCM with three and four cluster centres is able to segment the global and local damages respectively. The global damages due to different impinges are classified better compared to the local damages. The global damages in the rear side are able to classify better compared to the front side in both geometrical and ZM features. In the case of local damages, the rear side is able to classify better in 5 mm\u20136 mm and front side in 6 mm\u20137 mm.

First with the aid of microcontroller and four passive IR sensors system will automatically detect the presence of animal and rotate the camera toward that direction.

Then the captured images send to the PC and are compared with photograph database to check whether the animal is exactly the same as the photographer choice. If that captured animal is the exactly one who need to capture then it will automatically capture more. Though there are several technologies available none of these are capable of recognizing what it captures. There is no detection of animal presence in different angles. Most of available equipment uses a set of PIR sensors and whatever it disturbs the IR field will automatically be captured and stored.

Standardized tests improve on the reliability but are still prone to subjective ratings and require human expert knowledge. This paper presents a novel method to characterize the motor state of Parkinson patients using full body motion capturing data based on a combination of multiple metrics. Our approach merges various metrics with a Random Forest and uses a probabilistic formulation to compute a one-dimensional measure for the performed motion. We present an application of our approach to the problem of relating subject motion to different classes like healthy subjects and Parkinson disease patients with deep brain stimulation switched on or off. In the experimental session we show that our measure leads to high classification rates and high entropy values for real-world data.

So far, the wood strength has been measured using relatively expensive laboratory tests both for purchase and rent. In addition, this test has also damaged the test wood. An alternative method that can be used to determine the strength class of woods is to observe their characteristics using the naked eye. However, this is also a tough challenge because it must be done by wood experts who truly memorize and understand the characteristics of each wood class. Therefore, an image processing method is needed to identify the strength of wood easily, cheaply and not to damage test wood.The object of this study consisted of seven types of wood: Acacia (Acacia mangium), Teak (Tectona grandis), Mahogany (Swietenia mahagoni), Silk Tree (Paraserianthes falcataria), Sengon Tekik, Rain Tree (Samanea Saman) and Coastal Cottonwood (Hibiscus tiliaceus). Based on the results of specific gravity measurement, the wood strength classes of the test wood were as follows : Acacia, Teak and Mahogany were Class II, Rain Tree and Coastal Cottonwood were Class III, while Silk Tree and Sengon Tekik were Class IV.The parameters used by the author to determine the strength of wood based on image processing are the RGB color and texture of the wood image. We use two feature extraction methods, the average RGB histogram value for each color channel and the static characteristics of the Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) method. The method used for feature selection is Recursive Feature Elimination Cross Validation (RFECV). While for data classification we use five algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Decision Tree (CART), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results of the qualifications showed that the highest accuracy was obtained by the KNN of 95%.

One solution is to retrieve images with known pose from a database for the localization of query images.

In this paper, a novel domain-invariant feature learning method (DIFL) is proposed based on ComboGAN, a multi-domain image translation network architecture. By introducing a feature consistency loss (FCL) between the encoded features of the original image and translated image in another domain, we are able to train the encoders to generate domain-invariant features in a self-supervised manner. To retrieve a target image from the database, the query image is first encoded using the encoder belonging to the query domain to obtain a domain-invariant feature vector. We then preform retrieval by selecting the database image with the most similar domain-invariant feature vector. We validate the proposed approach on the CMU-Seasons dataset, where we outperform state-of-the-art learning-based descriptors in retrieval-based localization for high and medium precision scenarios.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1909.10184", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IROS40897.2019.8968047", "venue": "2019 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)", "journal": "2019 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2974441319,3003924953", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["51921013", "52111255", "206704277", "3848539", "5615932", "3831269", "52842019", "67855693", "6441226", "206767722", "6200260", "1033682", "206770979", "3783306", "9417016", "4883312", "17969052", "206775640", "1912782", "2389213", "4644084", "4126652"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202719460"}

First, a computational model is described to illustrate the proposed approach.

In this paper, we develop a data-driven approach to kernel fusion that learns how each kernel contributes to the final kernel and how they interact with each other. We discuss various kernel fusion models and find that kernel fusion using Gaussian Conditional Random Fields performs best.

State-of-the-art credit scoring models are based on learning methods. These methods need to cope with the problem of imbalanced classes since credit scoring datasets usually contain mainly paid loans and few defaults (unpaid ones). Recently, new imbalanced learning techniques have been proposed in the literature, and they can improve the credit scoring results. Motivated by this scenario, we evaluate several classification approaches to credit scoring. Besides, we also assess some preprocessing methods to overcome skewed datasets. To achieve it, we use three public real-world credit scoring datasets. In our experiments, we progressively increase the class imbalance in each of these datasets by randomly undersampling the minority class of defaulters to identify how the predictive power is affected. The results indicate that random forest, extreme gradient boosting perform very well in all imbalance levels. We also find that a complete grid search step can increase the prediction power of classification approaches in high imbalanced datasets.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICMLA.2019.00133", "venue": "2019 18th IEEE International Conference On Machine Learning And Applications (ICMLA)", "journal": "2019 18th IEEE International Conference On Machine Learning And Applications (ICMLA)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3007963259", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["154137886", "3511678", "14217079", "2922869", "2", "40794380", "61393304", "13043115", "1554582", "38870724", "2391953", "10620060", "207579369", "3405605", "120078898", "13295968"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211227561"}

The myriad of asphaltene molecules falls largely into two conceptual classes: continental-possessing a single polyaromatic core-and archipelago-possessing multiple polyaromatic cores linked by alkyl chains. In this work, we study the influence of molecular architecture upon aggregation behavior and molecular folding of prototypical archipelago asphaltenes using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation and nonlinear manifold learning. The mechanistic details of aggregation depend sensitively on the molecular structure. Molecules possessing three polyaromatic cores show a higher aggregation propensity than those with two, and linear archipelago architectures more readily form a fractal network than ring topologies, although the resulting aggregates are more susceptible to disruption by chemical dispersants. The Yen-Mullins hierarchy of self-assembled aggregates is attenuated at high asphaltene mass fractions because of the dominance of promiscuous parallel stacking interactions within a percolating network rather than the formation of rodlike nanoaggregates and nanoaggregate clusters. The resulting spanning porous network possesses a fractal dimension of 1.0 on short length scales and 2.0 on long length scales regardless of the archipelago architecture. The incompatibility of the observed assembly behavior with the Yen-Mullins hierarchy lends support that high-molecular weight archipelago architectures do not occur at significant levels in natural crude oils. Low-dimensional free energy surfaces discovered by nonlinear dimensionality reduction reveal a rich diversity of metastable configurations and folding behavior reminiscent of protein folding and inform how intramolecular structures can be modulated by controlling asphaltene mass fraction and dispersant concentration.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29856608", "doi": "10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01634", "venue": "The journal of physical chemistry.

Interactive classification aims at introducing user preferences in the learning process to produce individualized outcomes more adapted to each user's behavior than the fully automatic approaches. The current interactive classification systems generally adopt a single-label classification paradigm that constrains items to span one label at a time and consequently limit the user's expressiveness while he/she interacts with data that are inherently multi-label. Moreover, the experimental evaluations are mainly subjective and closely depend on the targeted use cases and the interface characteristics.

Methods: Data from eight 6\u201312 month trials (15524 patients) with budesonide/formoterol (Symbicort SMART \u00ae ) or formoterol (Oxis \u00ae ) using standardised collection of asthma exacerbations and diary card variables were investigated.

Random Forest methodology identified the most predictive variables. Composite Exacerbation (CompEx) was defined as first event of either diary event or SevEx. Performance was assessed by comparing treatment effects as hazard ratios relative to SevEx. Results: When censored at 3 months, 20% of patients experienced CompEx events vs 8% for SevEx with small variations between studies and CompEx algorithms. At least 50% of all SevEx were not captured by a diary event. CompEx defined by PEF and rescue SABA use alone was associated with best overall performance and statistical power.

In this paper, a novel and rigorous framework, which integrates SVMs and Markov random field models in a unique formulation for spatial contextual classification, is proposed.

This brings about overfitting problem and causes a decrease in regression model performance for predicting health expenditures. It is possible to use data mining based regression methods to improve classical regression model performances and overcome overfitting problem. Regression Tress, Random Forest Regression and Support Vector Regression are some of these methods. In this study it is aimed to compare prediction performances of different regression methods about predicting per capita health expenditures of member of total 214 World Bank countries. Materials and Methods: Before the analysis the distribution of health expenditure per capita normalized with using logarithmic and Box-Cox transformations. Multiple Linear Regression, Regression Tree, Random Forest Regression and Support Vector Machine Regression methods was used for prediction and R2, RMSE and MAE values are used for the assessment of prediction performances. Performance results are compared according to cross validation values determined by using different number of \u201ck\u201d parameters.

Low SA may be an indicator of worsening disease biology, increased inflammation, or increased co-morbidities. Changing demographics and improved care of the elderly may abrogate some of the risk attributable to age. SA, however, may not be influenced by such changes. Currently the Revised International Prognostic Index (R-IPI), the currently best accepted model for prognosis in DLBCL, does not account for albumin. We therefore explored the use of albumin as a prognostic variable in conjunction with the covariates included in the R-IPI. ::: ::: Methods Patients with DLBCL treated between 2007-2010 with RCHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) were retrospectively identified using the Moffitt Total Cancer Care platform. Age, ECOG performance status, LDH, extrandoal sites of disease, stage, and albumin were collected and analyzed using Random Forest Modeling. Both age and extranodal involvement failed to retain statistical significance and were dropped from the model, leading to the generation of a new algorithm, the Albumin Adjusted IPI (A-IPI). This score assigned a point for SA the upper limit of normal, ECOG performance status >=2, and Ann Arbor stage III-IV. Progression free and overall survival was compared by the risk groups using Kaplan-Meier curves along with the log rank test. Statistical analysis was done using R statistical software. ::: ::: Results A total of 124 patients were identified. Median age was 58 years with 62% male. 46% were over the age of 60 at diagnosis and 63% were Ann Arbor stage 3 or 4. The A-IPI score identified three groups of patients (Very good: A-IPI=0, Good: A-IPI=1-2, Poor: A-IPI=3-4), similar to the R-IPI. PFS and OS at 4 years were compared using the A-IPI and R-IPI ([Table 1][1]). ::: ::: View this table: ::: ::: Table 1 ::: Progression Free Survival and Overall Survival based on Albumin-IPI and Revised-IPI ::: ::: ::: ::: Conclusions In comparison to the R-IPI, the A-IPI appears to better define poor risk patients while retaining the ability to discriminate well between low (\u201cVery Good\u201d) and intermediate (\u201cGood\u201d) risk groups. Confirmation in a larger and prospective cohort is indicated, however, these preliminary data suggest SA may be a better surrogate for co-morbid status, pro-inflammatory states, and worse disease biology than age in patients with DLBCL. ::: ::: Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare. ::: ::: [1]: #T1", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1182/blood.V122.21.4267.4267", "venue": null, "journal": "Blood", "mag_id": "181906770", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:69101516"}

The arbitrary selection of biases and the input weight produce an unforeseen result which causes training error and also produces lesser prediction accuracy.

Our work aims at learning a privacy-preserving and task-oriented representation to defend against such model inversion attacks. Specifically, we propose an adversarial reconstruction learning framework that prevents the latent representations decoded into original input data. By simulating the expected behavior of adversary, our framework is realized by minimizing the negative pixel reconstruction loss or the negative feature reconstruction (i.e., perceptual distance) loss. We validate the proposed method on face attribute prediction, showing that our method allows protecting visual privacy with a small decrease in utility performance. In addition, we show the utility-privacy trade-off with different choices of hyperparameter for negative perceptual distance loss at training, allowing service providers to determine the right level of privacy-protection with a certain utility performance.

In this paper, we propose a novel metric learning framework, called ''Dependence Maximization based Metric Learning'' (DMML), which can efficiently integrate these two sources of information into a unified structure as instances of convex programming without requiring balance weights. In DMML, the metric is trained by maximizing the dependence between data distributions in the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). Unlike learning in the existing information theoretic algorithms, however, DMML requires no estimation or assumption of data distributions. Under this proposed framework, we present two methods by employing different independence criteria respectively, i.e., Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion and the generalized Distance Covariance.

The available methods for protein fold recognition are limited by the low fold-coverage and/or low prediction accuracies. We describe here a new Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based method for protein fold prediction with high prediction accuracy and high fold-coverage. The new method of fold prediction with high fold-coverage was developed by training and testing on a large number of folds in order to make the method suitable for large scale fold predictions. However, presence of large number of folds in the training set made the classification task difficult as a consequence of increased complexity involved in binary classifications of SVMs. In order to overcome this complexity we adopted a hierarchical approach where fold-prediction is made in two steps. At the first step structural class of the query is predicted and at the second step fold is predicted within the predicted structural class. This decreased the complexity of the classification problem and also improved the overall fold prediction accuracy. To the best of our knowledge this is the first taxonomic fold recognition method to cover over 700 protein-folds and gives prediction accuracy of around 70% on a benchmark dataset. Since the new method gives rise to state of the art prediction performance and hence can be very useful for structural characterization of proteins discovered in various genomes.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "22008449", "doi": "10.2390/biecoll-jib-2011-185", "venue": "Journal of integrative bioinformatics", "journal": "Journal of integrative bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2183987771", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["8469410", "6823830", "1653309", "9728696", "11983482", "7935407", "23373242", "2389639", "54483050", "52874011", "961425", "765861", "6869184", "14855409", "17815381", "12669405", "1077643"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7325238"}

In this vein, the Intrusion detection systems (IDS) have emerged as a viable solution for the detection and prevention of malicious activities. Unlike the signature-based detection approaches, machine learning-based solutions are a promising means for detecting unknown attacks. However, the machine learning models need to be accurate enough to reduce the number of false alarms. More importantly, they need to be trained and evaluated on realistic datasets such that their efficacy can be validated on real-time deployments. Many solutions proposed in the literature are reported to have high accuracy but are ineffective in real applications due to the non-representativity of the dataset used for training and evaluation of the underlying models. On the other hand, some of the existing solutions overcome these challenges but yield low accuracy which hampers their implementation for commercial tools. These solutions are majorly based on single learners and are therefore directly affected by the intrinsic limitations of each learning algorithm. The novelty of this paper is to use the most realistic dataset available for intrusion detection called NSL-KDD, and combine multiple learners to build ensemble learners that increase the accuracy of the detection. Furthermore, a deployment architecture in a fog-to-things environment that employs two levels of classifications is proposed. In such architecture, the first level performs an anomaly detection which reduces the latency of the classification substantially, while the second level, executes attack classifications, enabling precise prevention measures.

Resources, applications, and services can be scheduled around predicted failure and limit the impact. Such strategies are especially important for multi-computer systems, such as compute clusters, that experience a higher rate failure due to the large number of components. However providing accurate predictions with sufficient lead time remains a challenging problem. This paper describes a new spectrum-kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach to predict failure events based on system log files. These files containmessages that represent a change of system state. While a single message in the file may not be sufficient for predicting failure, a sequence or pattern of messages may be. The approach described in this paper will use a sliding window (sub-sequence) of messages to predict the likelihood of failure. The a frequency representation of the message sub-sequences observed are then used as input to the SVM. The SVM then associates the messages to a class of failed or non-failed system. Experimental results using actual system log files from a Linux-based compute cluster indicate the proposed spectrum-kernel SVM approach has promise and can predict hard disk failure with an accuracy of 73% two days in advance.

The performance dramatically degrades due to the missing data of old classes. Incremental learning methods have been proposed to retain the knowledge acquired from the old classes, by using knowledge distilling and keeping a few exemplars from the old classes. However, these methods struggle to scale up to a large number of classes. We believe this is because of the combination of two factors: (a) the data imbalance between the old and new classes, and (b) the increasing number of visually similar classes. Distinguishing between an increasing number of visually similar classes is particularly challenging, when the training data is unbalanced. We propose a simple and effective method to address this data imbalance issue. We found that the last fully connected layer has a strong bias towards the new classes, and this bias can be corrected by a linear model. With two bias parameters, our method performs remarkably well on two large datasets: ImageNet (1000 classes) and MS-Celeb-1M (10000 classes), outperforming the state-of-the-art algorithms by 11.1% and 13.2% respectively.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1905.13260", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CVPR.2019.00046", "venue": "2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)", "journal": "2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2954929116,2947585481", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1033682", "3945556", "2908606", "206594692", "7200347", "18398195", "58057743", "18268744", "941783", "47259365", "37308416", "61019113", "16435300", "15662659", "12253672", "206596260", "2930547", "1888776", "1358160", "14124313", "22101860", "19116714", "23072045", "3355837"], "inbound_citations": ["210966259", "208139404", "167217796", "214775266", "211259028", "210700925", "210700925", "211011072", "212633539", "211011110", "214667523", "211572588", "207853020", "208000091", "214714373", "214743106", "214624162", "214727773", "199000946"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:173187918"}

The Web contains an abundance of useful semi-structured information about real world objects, and the empirical study shows that strong two-dimensional sequence characteristics and correlative characteristics exist for Web information about objects of the same type across different Web sites. Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are the state-of-the-art approaches taking the sequence characteristics to do better labeling. However, as the appearance of correlative characteristics between Web object elements, previous CRFs have their limitations for semantic annotation of Web objects and cannot deal with the long distance dependencies between Web object elements efficiently. To better incorporate the long distance dependencies, on one hand, this paper describes long distance dependencies by correlative edges, which are built by making good use of structured information and the characteristics of records from external databases; and on the other hand, this paper presents a two-dimensional Correlative-Chain Conditional Random Fields (2DCC-CRFs) to do semantic annotation of Web objects. This approach extends a classic model, two-dimensional Conditional Random Fields (2DCRFs), by adding correlative edges. Experimental results using a large number of real-world data collected from diverse domains show that the proposed approach can significantly improve the semantic annotation accuracy of Web objects.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11390-010-1059-6", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Computer Science and Technology", "mag_id": "1996147428", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62198316"}

The tools to facilitate analysis of non-medical volumes are still primitive and require substantial user input. This thesis addresses three tasks of volumetric analysis, producing efficient algorithms for segmentation, interest detection, and view path generation. ::: The first major contribution is a clustering based segmentation algorithm that was designed to operate on noisy volumetric data. The initial data is a reconstruction from tomography or MRI and is inherently noisy. The segmentation algorithm operates by detecting statistically similar, although possibly non-contiguous, regions and then relabeling the volume monotonically using a Bayesian classifier based on the detected clusters in the volume. ::: The second major contribution is the development of a trainable interest detector. A Radial Mass Transform (RMT) is defined to characterize the local structure at each location in the volume. This transform is demonstrated to provide a rich characterization of local structure. The RMT is used as the base input to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to generate an application specific interest detector. The user selects a set of interesting and uninteresting regions in the volume, the SVM is trained using the labeled data, and the entire volume is classified. ::: The third major contribution is a view path, or tour, generating algorithm. Once volumes have been processed, a visual representation of the volume is helpful for users to better understand the structure of the data. An algorithm is developed to automatically generate view paths that maximize the amount of interest shown in a series of cross sections. The cross sections can be viewed as an animation, or virtual tour, providing the user with additional information about the structure of object(s) in the volume. ::: The algorithms are demonstrated on hundreds of synthetic volumes and dozens of real volumes, including many microvolumes scanned using the Argonne National Laboratory APS. Two common threads running through this work are that all techniques were designed to work on large volumes and to operate in parallel when possible. A typical data set is on the order of 400\u2013600 megabytes and may require several hours, if not days, of processing time on a desktop computer. The techniques we have developed are amenable to parallel processing, reducing processing time from days to hours or minutes.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2525439507", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["10391435"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:64061016"}

To study the effect of high frequencies due to EMG activity, three different frequency ranges (FR1=0.5\u2013110 Hz, FR2=0.5\u201330 Hz and FR3=30\u2013110 Hz) were considered. Indexes from power spectral analysis and plasma concentration of propofol and remifentanil were also compared with the bispectral index BIS. An adaptive Neurofuzzy Inference System was applied to model the interaction of the best indexes with respect to RSS score for each analysis, and leave-one-out cross validation method was used. The ability of the indexes to describe the level of sedation-analgesia, according with the RSS score, was evaluated using the prediction probability (Pk).

(b) Methods which consider top down cues as well, these methods utilize the context information as well for the modeling task. Natural images exhibit strong contextual dependencies in the form of spatial interactions among components. For example, neighboring pixels tend to have similar class labels, and different parts of an object are related through geometric constraints. Going beyond these, different regions e.g., objects such as, monitor and keyboard appear in restricted spatial configurations. Modeling these interactions is crucial for achieving good classification accuracy. In this thesis, we present a method based on Hierarchical Conditional Random Fields that can handle both bottom up and top down cues simultaneously. This offers tremendous advantages over existing methods which use either bottom up cues, or model only limited contextual information. The Tree Structured Conditional Random Field (TCRF) as proposed, is capable of capturing long range correlations at various levels of scales. TCRF has non loopy graph structure which allows us to perform inference in time linear in number of nodes. The model is generic enough to be applied to several challenging computer vision tasks, such as object detection and image labeling; seamlessly within a single, unified framework. iii", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2182527400", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15596469"}

Experimental results show this method can effectively detect the abnormal behavior of pedestrians in the crowd.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CCDC.2019.8833188", "venue": "2019 Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)", "journal": "2019 Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2972937391", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["18857775", "8590751", "15117267", "18001084", "9852942", "2925120", "40916795", "7695051", "29333691", "206591190", "14842257", "61330117", "2596985", "14648950", "64711781", "16224674", "197460292", "5626402"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202561850"}

Most of the existing run-time malware detection methods use the information available in Windows Application Programming Interface (API) calls.

This composite feature set is provided as an input to the malware detection system to raise the final alarm. Association mining based classification is used because it yields higher detection accuracy than previous data mining based detection systems which employed Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree techniques. A minimal subset of API categories is monitored while maintaining high detection accuracy. The number of generated rules is reduced, by removing the redundant rules, to make the malware analysis efficient. The key novelty of the proposed malware detection system is the iterative learning process combined with the run-time monitoring of program execution behavior which makes this as a dynamic malware detection system.

In this study, two classification methods using Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART\u2122) ionization coupled with Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (DART-TOFMS) data to discern between several species are presented. ::: ::: Methods ::: Metabolome profiles were collected using DART\u2122 ionization coupled with TOFMS analysis of heartwood specimens of all four Pericopsis species and Haplormosia monophylla (Harms) Harms, Dalbergia melanoxylon Guill. & Perr. Harms, and Milicia excelsa (Welw.) C.C. Berg. In total, 95 specimens were analysed and the spectra evaluated. Kernel Discriminant Analysis (KDA) and Random Forest classification were used to discern the species. ::: ::: Results ::: DART-TOFMS spectra obtained from wood slivers and post-processing analysis using KDA and Random Forest classification separated Pericopsis elata from the other Pericopsis taxa and its lookalike timbers Haplormosia monophylla, Milicia excelsa, and Dalbergia melanoxylon. Only 50 ions were needed to achieve the highest accuracy. ::: ::: Conclusions ::: DART-TOFMS spectra of the taxa were reproducible and the results of the chemometric analysis provided comparable accuracy. Haplormosia monophylla was visually distinguished based on the heatmap and was excluded from further analysis.

In general, training deep neural nets requires a humongous amount of labeled data, which is laborious and costly to collect and annotate. Recent advances in computer graphics shed light on utilizing photo-realistic synthetic data with computer generated annotations to train neural nets. Nevertheless, the domain mismatch between real images and synthetic ones is the major challenge against harnessing the generated data and labels. In this paper, we propose a principled way to conduct structured domain adaption for semantic segmentation, i.e., integrating GAN into the FCN framework to mitigate the gap between source and target domains. Specifically, we learn a conditional generator to transform features of synthetic images to real-image like features, and a discriminator to distinguish them. For each training batch, the conditional generator and the discriminator compete against each other so that the generator learns to produce real-image like features to fool the discriminator; afterwards, the FCN parameters are updated to accommodate the changes of GAN.

Surrogate selection could be performed at three different levels: (i) model type selection, (ii) basis (or kernel) function selection, and (iii) hyper-parameter selection where hyperparameters are those kernel parameters that are generally given by the users. Unlike the majority of existing model selection techniques, this paper explores the development of a method that performs selection coherently at all the three levels. In this context, the REES method is used to provide measures of the median and maximum errors of a candidate surrogate model. Two approaches are used for the 3-level selection; (i) A Cascaded approach performs each level in a nested loop in the order going from model-kernel-hyperparameters; (ii) A more advanced One-Step approach solves a MINLP to simultaneously optimize the model, kernel, and hyper-parameters. In both approaches, multiobjective optimization is performed to yield the best trade-offs between the estimated median and maximum errors. Candidate surrogates that are considered include (i) Kriging, (ii) Radial Basis Function (RBF), and (iii) Support Vector Regression (SVR), and multiple candidate kernels are allowed within these surrogate models. The 3-level REES-based model selection is compared with model selection based on error estimated on a large set of additional test points, for validation purposes.

Carbon nanotubes demonstrating metallic or semiconducting properties allow for high strength materials and high current densities in smaller wires. Due to their simplicity and desirable properties, SWNTs are considered for chiral-selective growth experiments. A machine learning based approach for chiral selective growth of SWNTs using a laser-induced chemical vapor deposition growth system is introduced. Determination of SWNT growth rates is performed through in-situ Raman spectroscopy using a 532 nm excitation laser. A total of 450 experiments are performed and a subset of 121 experiments are used to train a SWNT vs. MWNT SVM classifier. The SVM classifier determines parameter values for 99% probability or greater of SWNT growth with an accuracy of 95.04%. This subset of synthesis parameters are evaluated using an ANN to predict SWNT growth rates and growth lengths. Analysis of the ANN growth rate model showed a peak in growth rate as a function of water concentration and growth temperature. The growth length model was trained using the same growth experiments as the growth rate model and showed a 80% reduction in validation errors. The growth length model also identified an optimal water/ethylene ratio for maximizing SWNT length.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "329864916", "mag_field_of_study": ["Materials Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:136495961"}

The functional level is a level at which words' syntactic properties, not their phonological ones, are important. Independent-levels hypothesis is, 30 years later, reflected in the modular discrete-stage accounts of lexical access in production. It can be shown how these hypotheses continue to play a major role in present-day theory, most notably in accounts of lexical access during speaking. The thrust of this chapter, however, is that recent connectionist models of production blur Garrett's sharp distinctions. With regard to the independent levels hypothesis, the chapter argues that although these levels (or something like them) exist, these are not independent. Lemma selection is influenced by phonological information; such information is normally part of a later step in the process. This influence can be modeled by interactive or feedback connections from phonological to word units. The interactive two-step model, in particular, offers an account of a variety of phenomena that may arise from interaction, while retaining the staged character of lexical access emphasized in discrete approaches.

The clusters derived from the segmentation maps by the mean-shift algorithm are regarded as groups in GSC, where pixels within the same group are simultaneously represented by a sparse linear combination of a few common atoms in a given dictionary, thus enforcing spatial smoothness across the pixels in the same segmentation region to learn a spectral\u2013spatial joint sparse representation. Finally, the recovered sparse representation can be viewed as a new feature and used directly for classification (e.g., by support vector machine). In comparison with other spectral\u2013spatial classification techniques that exploit a fixed neighborhood system and force neighboring pixels to share a common sparsity pattern, the proposed method is more flexible and able to obtain adaptive spatial neighborhood correlations for spectral\u2013spatial joint sparse coding. In addition, we also develop kernel GSC (KGSC) by incorporating the kernel trick into GSC to capture nonlinear relationships. The developed KGSC can also be applied to learning kernel sparse representation under the framework of the proposed spectral\u2013spatial method, leading to a new spectral\u2013spatial kernel sparse representation algorithm.

Whenever a VTU stops reporting for a long period of time, e.g. a week, it is thus of extreme importance to be able to understand whether the unit is healthy or in a faulty condition.The present paper proposes a method that automatically detects VTUs that stop reporting under anomalous conditions, for instance due to low data signal coverage, connection loss, power loss, wiring issues or hardware faults; the method separates the aforementioned cases from healthy units that are in a deep sleep mode after the vehicle has been turned off. Our method exploits patterns extracted from the messages sent on the days before the last message, from historical information about the vehicle activity and from contextual information.The discrimination method is a Random Forest classifier, trained on historical VTU message data that include examples of both healthy shut-downs and anomalies, collected by Verizon Connect.

So far, existing algorithms are designed by exploring one or several special features, which usually result in limited performance and applicability. With the perspective of entire procedure including image acquisition and image processing, a theory of general blind image forensics is proposed in this paper. Then a new blind image forensic method is designed based on this theory to identify camera source and processing history of cropped compressed digital images.

The proposed intelligent system consists of three stages. At the first stage, Principal Component Analysis is used for feature extraction and dimension reduction. At the second stage, the pattern classification is achieved by using Least Square Support Vector Machine Classifier. Finally, at the third stage the performance evaluation of the system is estimated by using classification accuracy and 10-fold cross-validation. Results. The proposed prediction system can be used in asthma outcome prediction with 95.54 % success as shown in the experimental results. Conclusions.

In order to solve these two problems, we introduce a Prototype Support Layer (PSL) before SVM training, which is maintained by a Learning Prototype Network (LPN). The LPN learns representative prototypes from the input data in an online way and the PSL records the learned prototypes based on which the SVM is trained. As the size of the prototypes in the PSL is small in comparison with original data, L3-SVM is very fast. Another challenge of lifelong learning is the \u201copen-ended\u201d environment, i.e. data from novel classes or new distributions may occur during learning, upon which the classifiers should be retrained or updated. Many versions of incremental SVM only retain the Support Vectors after training, losing much potentially useful information of the original data, which leads to a declined performance as new data arrives. The PSL, on the other hand, works as a Long Term Memory (LTM) system. It records the representative prototypes of all previous data. Experiments demonstrate that the SVM trained upon these representative prototypes is as accurate as the state-of-the-art SVM, and much faster and can handle much larger data set than existing methods. Moreover, due to the incremental and self-adaptive properties of LPN, L3-SVM is able to work efficiently and effectively when novel class data come.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280379", "venue": "2015 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)", "journal": "2015 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1648633183", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7138354", "9016542", "17924269", "2854731", "17617367", "11372862", "2235233", "14227081", "2785136", "10778738", "47460306", "206775459", "961425", "14500006", "207163669"], "inbound_citations": ["6640731", "201703205", "3422188", "53231033"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9488257"}

Methods We collected information from 287 patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy between 2009 and 2017 at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University. Patients were prospectively followed up for at least 3 years. A number of features, including demographic features, medical history, and auxiliary examinations (electroencephalogram [EEG] and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) are selected to distinguish patients with different remission outcomes. Seizure outcomes classified as remission and never remission. In addition, remission is further divided into early remission and late remission. Five classical machine learning algorithms, i.e., Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression, are selected and trained by our dataset to get classification models. Results Our study shows that 1) compared with the other four algorithms, the XGBoost algorithm based machine learning model achieves the best prediction performance of the AED treatment outcomes between remission and never remission patients with an F1 score of 0.947 and an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.979; 2) The best discriminative factor for remission and never remission patients is higher number of seizures before treatment (> 3); 3) XGBoost-based machine learning model also offers the best prediction between early remission and later remission patients, with an F1 score of 0.836 and an AUC value of 0.918; 4) multiple seizure type has the highest dependence to the categories of early and late remission patients.

In particular, we use the chaotic Boltzmann machine (CBM) whose units exhibit chaotic behavior in the hypercube. The units interact with each other in a time-domain manner through its binary state, and thus an efficient hardware implementation of the system is expected. In order to utilize the CBM as the reservoir, it is necessary to control its chaotic behavior for ensuring the echo state property of RC and establish encoding and decoding for input and output signal. For this purpose, we introduce a reference clock and analyze effects and properties of the reference input.

To address this data gap, we aimed to create a database that provides information on availability (ie, supply) of 156 nutrients across 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2013. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: We matched 394 food and agricultural commodities from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Supply and Utilization Accounts (SUAs) to food items in the United States Department of Agriculture Food Composition Database and obtained data on nutrient composition of the SUAs' food items. Then, after adjusting for inedible portion of each food item, we added the contributions of individual food items to the availability of each nutrient and estimated the national availability of macronutrients and micronutrients in each year. We validated our estimates by comparing our results with those of national nutrition surveys from three countries (the USA, South Korea, and Ecuador). Using dietary consumption data from the Global Burden of Disease study and two popular machine learning algorithms (Random Forest and XGBoost [extreme gradient boosting]), we developed predictive models to estimate the consumption of each nutrient based on their national availability. ::: ::: ::: FINDINGS ::: Globally 2710 kcal (95% UI 2660-2770) were available per person per day in 2013. Carbohydrates were the major contributor to energy availability (70\u00b75%), followed by fats (17\u00b74%), and protein (10\u00b75%). The energy availability and the contribution of macronutrients to total energy widely varied across levels of development. Countries at the higher level of development (high Socio-demographic Index countries) had more energy available per person per day (3270 kcal, 3220-3310); greater contributions from fats (26\u00b70%) and proteins (11\u00b79%) to total energy availability; and lower contributions from carbohydrate (54\u00b78%). During 1980-2013, energy availability and the contributions of protein and fats to energy availability have increased globally and across levels of development while the contribution of carbohydrates to total energy availability has decreased. The supply of the micronutrients has also increased during the same period globally and across levels of development. Our validation analysis showed that, after accounting for waste at the retail and household level, our estimates of macronutrient availability were very close to the consumption data in nationally representative surveys. Our machine-learning models closely predicted the observed intake of nutrients with the out-of-sample correlation of greater than 0\u00b78 between predicted and observed intake for the nutrients included in the analysis. ::: ::: ::: INTERPRETATION ::: Our global nutrient database provides a picture of the supply of various nutrients at the country level and can be useful to assess the performance of national food systems in addressing the nutritional needs of their population. ::: ::: ::: FUNDING ::: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6076406", "pubmed_id": "30082050", "doi": "10.1016/S2542-5196(18)30170-0", "venue": "The Lancet.

For the similarity features of the protein in the networks, we integrate both topological features with biological characteristics to provide enhanced supports for the alignment procedures. For topological features, we propose to apply a representation learning method on the networks that can generate a low dimensional vector embedding with its surrounding structural features for each protein. The topological similarity of proteins from different PPI networks can thus be transferred as the similarity of their corresponding vector representations, which provides a new way to comprehensively quantify the topological similarities between proteins.

Materials and methods The APW dataset analysed was composed by signals acquired in a clinical environment from a total of 213 subjects, including healthy volunteers and non-healthy patients. The signals were parameterised by means of 39 pulse features: morphologic, time domain statistics, cross-correlation features, wavelet features. Multiclass Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM RFE) method was used to select the most relevant features. A comparative study was performed in order to evaluate the performance of the two classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Results and discussion SVM achieved a statistically significant better performance for this problem with an average accuracy of 0.9917 \u00b1 0.0024 and a F-Measure of 0.9925 \u00b1 0.0019, in comparison with ANN, which reached the values of 0.9847 \u00b1 0.0032 and 0.9852 \u00b1 0.0031 for Accuracy and F-Measure, respectively. A significant difference was observed between the performances obtained with SVM classifier using a different number of features from the original set available.

ELM is a fast learning network with remarkable generalization performance. Although ELM generally can outperform traditional gradient descent-based algorithms such as Backpropagation, its performance can be highly affected by the random selection of the input weights and hidden biases of SLFN. Moreover, ELM networks tend to have more hidden neurons due to this random selection. In this paper, we propose a new model that uses Competitive Swarm Optimizer (CSO) to optimize the values of the input weights and hidden neurons of ELM. Two versions of ELM are considered: the classical ELM and the regularized version. The goal of the model is to increase the generalization performance, stabilize the classifier, and to produce more compact networks by reducing the number of neurons in the hidden layer. The proposed model is experimented based on 15 medical classification problems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve better generalization performance with smaller number of hidden neurons and with higher stability.

This tissue may be identified with suitable classification methods from magnetic resonance imaging data. The aim of the present study was to assess and compare the performance of five popular classification methods (Adaptive Boosting, Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine) in identifying tissue at high risk of infarction on human voxel-based brain imaging data. The classification methods were used with eight MRI parameters, including diffusion-weighted imaging and perfusion-weighted imaging obtained in 55 patients. The five criteria used to assess the performance of the methods were the area under the receiver operating curve (AUCroc ), the area under the precision-recall curve (AUCpr ), sensitivity, specificity, and the Dice coefficient. The methods performed equally in terms of sensitivity and specificity, while the results of AUCroc and the Dice coefficient were significantly better for Adaptive Boosting, Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Networks, and Random Forest. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the performances of these five classification methods regarding AUCpr , which was the main comparison metric. Machine learning methods can provide valuable prognostic information using multimodal imaging data in acute ischemic stroke, which in turn can assist in developing personalized treatment decision for clinicians after a thorough validation of methods with an independent dataset.

Further, the simple undirected view combination may adversely reduce the reliability of the ultimate similarity structure for feature selection, as the view-specific similarity structures generally involve noises and outlying entries. To alleviate these problems, we propose an adaptive collaborative similarity learning (ACSL) for multi-view feature selection. We propose to dynamically learn the collaborative similarity structure, and further integrate it with the ultimate feature selection into a unified framework. Moreover, a reasonable rank constraint is devised to adaptively learn an ideal collaborative similarity structure with proper similarity combination weights and desirable neighbor assignment, both of which could positively facilitate the feature selection.

It is shown here how a robot can, using a recurrent network (the CNM predictive map ), learn a model of its environment that allows it to predict what sensations it would have if it were to move in a particular way. It is shown how this predictive ability can be used (via the CNM orienting system ) to enable the robot to determine its current location.

Another characteristic upon which melodies can be categorized, however, is according to the contour (general shape, or sequence of up and down movements in frequencies from note to note). Given the existence of these various characteristics, there has been considerable research and speculation on the extent to which these categorizations contribute to a listener\u2019s mental representation of a melody, and how they may interact. Like many other cognitive processes, the perception of music involves processes and structural considerations that are highly relational in nature. To date, no physiologically plausible model has been used to simulate and explain how infants perceive melodic content. Here we used DORA (Discovery Of Relations by Analogy; Doumas et al., 2008), a domain-general symbolic-connectionist model of relational learning, to simulate melodic perception and categorization by infants (Chang & Trehub, 1977; Trehub et al, 1984), and to provide an account of the mechanism for melodic processing in infants. Given four input semantic features for each note in the melodic stimuli sequence (two of which could be internally obtained from the other two via a comparator), DORA\u2019s performance matched the behavioral data from the infant studies. Furthermore, the ability of our model to simulate infants\u2019 behavior is evidence that structured representations of relational musical properties can be bootstrapped from unstructured feature representations. Relative pitch and melodic contour The properties of relative pitch (or intervallic patterns) are most commonly used in long term musical storage and recall (Page, 1994). For example, when listening to the melody of a song, such as Happy Birthday, what makes the song immediately recognizable is the unique intervals between each of the notes in the song. That is, the song is recognizable whether it initially starts on a low or high note due to the unique intervallic pattern between all subsequent notes. There is much evidence on the use of relative pitch information in adults through both behavioral studies (Dowling, 1978, 1984, 1988) as well as neuroimaging studies (Fujioka, Trainor, Ross, Kakigi, & Pantev, 2004; Trainor, McDonald, & Alain, 2002). It is worth noting that while a melody with an identical contour to Happy Birthday, but with a different intervallic sequence would sound like a completely different tune, it would still have the same general \u201cshape\u201d, or up and down pattern. Although the intervallic pattern may be the most overtly salient feature of a melody, studies have shown that human adults are also sensitive to absolute pitch and melodic contour in the short term (Bartlett & Dowling, 1980; Dowling, 1978). And while there is evidence that infants may also be sensitive to intervallic information (Trehub, Bull, & Thorpe, 1984), numerous experiments with infants suggest that they may primarily encode melodies using contour information (for review, see Trehub, 2001; Trehub, Trainor, & Unyk, 1993). Even though intervallic and contour properties may characteristically differ in the type of information they Keywords: Melodic perception; relative pitch; relational learning; symbolic connectionist; DORA. Introduction While there are many defining characteristics of music (e.g., harmony, rhythm, timbre, pitch, etc.), one of the most fundamental and salient aspects is the melody. Indeed, simple melodies were likely the earliest form of music to have been created and transmitted, and have been (and still are) prevalent in all documented cultures past and present (Sachs, 1943). Simple melodies consist of discrete units or notes, with each note characterized by a pitch, or fundamental frequency. Importantly, there are several ways in which the pitch sequence of a melody can then be encoded and stored. The two most well documented forms of encoding are absolute or relative pitch. Absolute pitch encodes and stores a melody using the fundamental frequencies of each pitch, while relative pitch (or intervallic) encodes the melody in terms of the relations (or specific frequency differences) between each note. Notably, processing melodies in terms of the relative pitch information (or intervallic patterns) is considered to be the strategy most humans use to", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1037/e611062013-001", "venue": "CogSci", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1533632116", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["30785003", "4651905", "53974119", "1989372", "6483066", "1044235", "157065666", "144569935", "148279600", "1114697", "121650044", "14313793", "143622641", "17575060", "254282", "980669", "11961708", "162009578", "145165611", "16355329", "18641935", "205638950", "53484375", "54184886", "35294618", "143755829", "11512098", "1606607", "16237483", "16108296", "31471675"], "inbound_citations": ["34893900", "17444102", "202715586", "7694522"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14294129"}

The proposed IE framework is composed of two primary components: (1) ontology-based sequence labelling for term identification, and (2) ontology-based dependency grammar for relationship association. This paper focuses on presenting the proposed sequence labelling methodology. The methodology utilizes ontology-based begin, inside, and outside (BIO) encoding for phrase-level segmentation and Conditional Random Field (CRF) for ontology-based labelling in both token and phrase levels.

We develop an agent-based model featuring near-zero-intelligence traders operating in a call market with a wide range of trading rules governing the determination of prices, which orders are executed as well as a range of parameters regarding market intervention by market makers and the presence of informed traders. The market structure which generates the best market performance is determined by applying the search technique Population-based Incremental Learning, guided by a number of performance measures, including maximizing trading volume or price, minimizing bid-ask spread or return volatility. We investigate the credibility of our model by observing the trading behavior of near-zero-intelligence traders with stylized facts in real markets. Based on computer simulations, we conform that the model is capable to reproduce some of the most important stylized facts found in financial markets. Thereafter, we investigate the best found market structure using both single-objective optimization and multi-objective optimization techniques. Our results suggest that the best-found combination of trading rules used to enhance trading volume may not be applied to achieve other objectives, such as reducing bid-ask spread. The results of single-objective optimization experiments show that significantly large tick sizes appear in the best market structures in most cases, except for the case of maximizing trading volume. The tick size is always correlated with the selection of multi-price rules. Though there is no particular combination of priority rule and multiprice rule achieving the best market performance, the time priority rule and the closest multi-price rule are the most frequently obtained rules. The level of market transparency and the extend of market maker intervention show ambiguous results as their representative parameter values change in a wide range. We also nd that the results of multi-objective optimization experiments are much similar to those obtained in the single-objective optimization experiments, except for the market transparency represented by the fraction of informed trader, which shows a clear trend in the multi-objective optimization.

It projects both sets of variables onto a lower-dimensional space in which they are maximally correlated. CCA is commonly applied for supervised dimensionality reduction in which the two sets of variables are derived from the data and the class labels, respectively. It is well-known that CCA can be formulated as a least-squares problem in the binary class case. However, the extension to the more general setting remains unclear. In this paper, we show that under a mild condition which tends to hold for high-dimensional data, CCA in the multilabel case can be formulated as a least-squares problem. Based on this equivalence relationship, efficient algorithms for solving least-squares problems can be applied to scale CCA to very large data sets. In addition, we propose several CCA extensions, including the sparse CCA formulation based on the 1-norm regularization. We further extend the least-squares formulation to partial least squares.

Hierarchical classification algorithm for multi-class classification is applied to diagnose the transformer fault. The membership value of the FSVM is obtained by Fuzzy C Means. Parameters of the FSVM model are optimized with Genetic Algorithm (GA). The transformer states are divided into trouble-free(normal), low temperature overheating T1, medium temperature overheating T2, high temperature overheating T3, low-energy discharge D1, high-energy discharge D2, and partial discharge PD. A mass of fault samples are analyzed and the results are compared with those obtained by the methods of Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) and SVM, which shows that the proposed model is more effective and accurate.

In order to solve the problem that the star/galaxy classification accuracy is high for the bright source set, but low for the faint source set of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data, we introduced the new deep learning algorithm, namely the SDA (stacked denoising autoencoder) neural network and the dropout fine-tuning technique, which can greatly improve the robustness and antinoise performance. We randomly selected respectively the bright source sets and faint source sets from the SDSS DR12 and DR7 data with spectroscopic measurements, and made preprocessing on them. Then, we randomly selected respectively the training sets and testing sets without replacement from the bright source sets and faint source sets. At last, using these training sets we made the training to obtain the SDA models of the bright sources and faint sources in the SDSS DR7 and DR12, respectively. We compared the test result of the SDA model on the DR12 testing set with the test results of the Library for Support Vector Machines (LibSVM), J48 decision tree, Logistic Model Tree (LMT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Decision Stump algorithm, and compared the test result of the SDA model on the DR7 testing set with the test results of six kinds of decision trees. The experiments show that the SDA has a better classification accuracy than other machine learning algorithms for the faint source sets of DR7 and DR12.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are undoubtedly the most widely used signals for measuring DoA. In this paper, a novel EEG-based index is proposed to evaluate DoA for 24 patients receiving general anaesthesia with different levels of unconsciousness. Sample Entropy (SampEn) algorithm was utilised in order to acquire the chaotic features of the signals. After calculating the SampEn from the EEG signals, Random Forest was utilised for developing learning regression models with Bispectral index (BIS) as the target. Correlation coefficient, mean absolute error, and area under the curve (AUC) were used to verify the perioperative performance of the proposed method. Validation comparisons with typical nonstationary signal analysis methods (i.e., recurrence analysis and permutation entropy) and regression methods (i.e., neural network and support vector machine) were conducted. To further verify the accuracy and validity of the proposed methodology, the data is divided into four unconsciousness-level groups on the basis of BIS levels. Subsequently, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to the corresponding index (i.e., regression output). Results indicate that the correlation coefficient improved to 0.72 \u00b1 0.09 after filtering and to 0.90 \u00b1 0.05 after regression from the initial values of 0.51 \u00b1 0.17. Similarly, the final mean absolute error dramatically declined to 5.22 \u00b1 2.12. In addition, the ultimate AUC increased to 0.98 \u00b1 0.02, and the ANOVA analysis indicates that each of the four groups of different anaesthetic levels demonstrated significant difference from the nearest levels. Furthermore, the Random Forest output was extensively linear in relation to BIS, thus with better DoA prediction accuracy. In conclusion, the proposed method provides a concrete basis for monitoring patients' anaesthetic level during surgeries.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5970554", "pubmed_id": "29844970", "doi": "10.7717/peerj.4817", "venue": "PeerJ", "journal": "PeerJ", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2803756686", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["15001134"], "inbound_citations": ["174807536", "160011079", "201813822", "210693784", "215254485", "215551332", "164602703", "201069288", "184486261"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:44119567"}

In domains like broadcast news or parliamentary speeches, speakers have a field of expertise they are associated with. We explore how topic information for a segment of speech, extracted from an automatic speech recognition transcript, can be employed to identify the speaker. Two methods for modelling topic preferences are compared: implicitly, based on speaker-characteristic keywords, and explicitly, by using automatically derived topic models to assign topics to the speech segments. In the keyword-based approach, the segments' tf-idf vectors are classified with Support Vector Machine speaker models. For the topic-model-based approach, a domain-specific topic model is used to represent each segment as a mixture of topics; the speakers' score is derived from the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the topic mixtures of their training data and of the segment. The methods were tested on political speeches given in German parliament by 235 politicians. We found that topic cues do carry speaker information, as the topic-model-based system yielded an equal error rate (EER) of 16.3%.

Water demand estimation, yield modeling and agrarian policy are only a few applications addressed by land use classifications based on remote sensing imagery. In Central Asia, where fields are traditionally large and state order crops dominate the area, small units of fields are often separated for the additional cultivation of income crops for the farmers. Traditional object based land use classifications on multi-temporal satellite imagery using field boundaries show low classification accuracies on these separated fields, expressed by a high uncertainty of the final class labels. Although segmentation of smaller subfields was shown to be suitable for improving the classification result, the extraction of subfields is still a time-consuming and error-prone process. In this study, energy based Graph-Cut segmentation technique is used to enhance the segmentation process and finally to improve the classification result. The interactive segmentation technique was successfully adopted from bio-medical image analysis to fit remote sensing imagery in the spatial and in the temporal domain. A set of rules was developed to perform the image segmentation procedure on pixels of single satellite datasets and on objects representing time series of a vegetation index. An ensemble classifier based on Random Forest and Support Vector Machines was used to receive information about classification uncertainty before and after applying the segmentation. It is demonstrated that subfield extraction based on Graph Cuts outperforms traditional image segmentation approaches in simplicity and reduces the risk of under- and over-segmentation significantly. Classification uncertainty decreased using the derived subfields as object boundaries instead of original field boundaries. The segmentation technique performs well on several multi-temporal satellite images without changing parameters and may be used to refine object based land use classifications to subfield level.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.974670", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1992250031", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["54741771", "62760738", "3027134", "10340550", "115691220", "61936075", "36955056", "128421805", "128470871", "57958681", "6375478", "129510855", "129447267", "648945", "133512341", "15190038"], "inbound_citations": ["129629014", "118739541"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:128407441"}

Pellets play an important role in the process of direct reduction steel manufacturing. For high quality steel production, pellets should be of an appropriate size. Oversized pellets cannot be properly cooked in furnace and undersized pellets may pass through metal grid of the furnace, which affects the performance of the process. In most of the steel manufacturing companies, operators use sequential sampling and traditional methods to measure size of pellets, however, limited number of tested pellets, low speed of the quality control and human errors are the most common drawbacks of this method. A solution to these shortcomings is continuous monitoring and accurate measurement through a fully-automatic approach. In this paper, a method using image processing technique is proposed and verified for estimating size distribution of iron-ore green pellets. For segmentation of single and multiple pellets in images captured from live video, we have utilized morphological methods, watershed algorithm, and linear searching. Then, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed for classification of segmented pellets. The proposed method has already been implemented in Mobarakeh Steel Complex, where the method was tested on about 1000 sample pellets.

Hotspots in sequence are most predicted to happen on peatland that have characteristics such as type of peatlands hemist, saprists or fibrists, peatland depth is shallow, medium or deep, and can happen in every type of land use that are used for plantation or other purposes. Field verification is required to be conducted in the future in order to evaluate the prediction model.

The recommended method to estimate evapotranspiration, Penman-Monteith FAO, requires variables not available in most weather stations. Simplified but less accurate methods, as Hargreaves equation, are normally used. Several approaches have been proposed to improve Hargreaves equation accuracy. In this work, 14 calibrations of the Hargreaves equation are compared. Three goodness of fit statistics were used to select the optimal, in terms of simplicity and accuracy. The best option was an annual linear regression. Its parameters were interpolated using regression-kriging combining Random Forest and Ordinary Kriging. Twelve easy to obtain ancillary variables were used as predictors. The same approach was used to interpolate Hargreaves and Penman-Monteith-FAO ET0 on a daily basis; the Hargreaves ET0 layers and the parameter layers were used to obtain calibrated ET0 estimations. To compare the spatial patterns of the three estimations the daily layers were integrated into annual layers. The results of the proposed calibration are much more similar to Penman-Monteith FAO results than those obtained with Hargreaves equation.

Does Mind Really Work That Way? Tatiana V.

Jackendoff discussing Universal Grammar as a set of attractors causing the Human capacity to learn any language on the basis of the assumption that \u2018everything is already there, and the learner has only to set the options to suit the environment\u2019, argues and that \u2018it is hard to imagine all this structure emerging in the brain prior to experience, much less being coded genetically... Moreover, inheritance is not absolute: it tolerates partial violations, for instance in irregular verbs and idioms\u2019 (2002, p.190-191). The debates based on experiments with L1 and L2 acquisition, with normal adults and children and on clinical observations continue and become more and more technical, and not just theoretical. However, a novel and much more flexible view has appeared from the unexpected address (Hauser, Chomsky and Fitch, 2002) and it argues that distinction should be made between the faculty of language in the broad sense (FLB) and in the narrow sense (FLN): FLB includes a sensory-motor system, a conceptual-intentional system, and the internal computational mechanisms, providing the capacity to generate an infinite range of expressions from a finite set of elements. Most of FLB is shared with other species. FLN only includes recursion and is the only uniquely human component of the faculty of language... Human system of recursion operates with broader range of elements than in other animals and we can apply it to all cognitive tasks. All these features are traditionally believed to be subserved by the speech zones of the left cerebral hemisphere. While the right hemisphere is responsible for a large part of the lexicon, global/Gestalt recognition, for revealing the relevant components of a situation (or a scene), for relatively higher speed of decision making, classification of colors and odors, orientation in space and time, evaluation of gestures, face expressions and verbal prosody, metaphoric thinking, etc. (Chernigovskaya, The paper discusses specificity of linguistic competence, brain imaging data, mental lexicon in language acquisition and pathology. Connectionist and modular approaches are observed in the context of origins of language and in the cognitive framework. Introduction Nobody doubts that language is a set of conventions, some of them more or less explicit, some hidden within the brain in the form of the algorithms that we hope to reveal. Chomsky and his followers hold that generative rules go all the way down, and that they are universal and genetically based. It is evident that there is something that we store in the brain and something that we compute. However, what do we store: lexemes (tens of thousands) or concepts? In what form and by what means interconnected? And rules too, at least some of them, hundreds of such, not consciously operated and not reflected - in case of the native language. It is evident, that languages differ in the way they code semantic or functional relations. The notion that all languages are somehow equal in complexity and expressiveness is often thought to be scientific truth. However, language diversity becomes evident and realized by the majority of brain and language scholars. Language Origins and Specificity Origins of language is the problem that until recently both linguists and representatives of other anthropological sciences were feared to consider, as, strictly speaking, the answer to the question as to how and when the human language appeared can be based only on reconstructions. Chomsky and Bickerton consider the \u201cgrammatical explosion\u201d a result of macromutation, whereas Pinker \u2014 a result of natural selection of small mutations, i.e., of much slower process (Bickerton, 1990; Bloom, 2002; Chomsky, 2002; Fodor 2001; Pinker, Bloom,1990). The scientific community is divided into two camps - those who think the human language to be although very complex, but nevertheless a successor of communicative systems of the nearest biological ancestors and those who adhere to the unique system that performs not only communicative, but also peculiar thinking function and has a structure completely lacking in any other biological codes: \u2018digital\u2019 and hierarchical (phonemes - morphemes -", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2586275243", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3302100", "32615642", "140836727", "140369608", "16634731", "22584942", "44048850", "44267870", "155422876", "9343153", "16084005", "30517695", "14206633", "24917771", "6167614", "59783317", "29189560", "14611894"], "inbound_citations": ["23652682"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15131844"}

In recent year, machine vision method has been used to differentiate the acceptable and failed spot welding products according to their solder joint images. This opened new opportunities for the spot welding product quality evaluation using digital image technique. However, this method cannot achieve general performance on different spot-welding products as well as ideal classification accuracy. In this work, a novel method which based on the transfer learning technique was proposed to classify the spot-welding products according to their solder joint images.

Considering the ratio of true miRNA sequences to pseudo-miRNA sequences is on the order of 1:1000, such low specificity prevents the application of most existing tools to non-human genomes, as the number of false positives overwhelms the true predictions. We here introduce a framework (SMIRP) for creating species-specific miRNA prediction systems, leveraging sequence conservation and phylogenetic distance information. Substantial improvements in specificity and precision are obtained for four non-human test species when our framework is applied to three different prediction systems representing two types of classifiers (support vector machine and Random Forest), based on three different feature sets, with both human-specific and taxon-wide training data.

This is true, for instance, with pair-wise matchers (e.g., deep Siamese networks) that typically rely on a reference gallery with one still image per individual. However, generating synthetic images in the source domain may not improve the performance during operations due to the domain shift w.r.t. the target domain. Moreover, despite the emergence of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for realistic synthetic generation, it is often difficult to control the conditions under which synthetic faces are generated. In this paper, a cross-domain face synthesis approach is proposed that integrates a new Controllable GAN (C-GAN). It employs an off-the-shelf 3D face model as a simulator to generate face images under various poses. The simulated images and noise are input to the C-GAN for realism refinement which employs an additional adversarial game as a third player to preserve the identity and specific facial attributes of the refined images. This allows generating realistic synthetic face images that reflects capture conditions in the target domain while controlling the GAN output to generate faces under desired pose conditions. Experiments were performed using videos from the Chokepoint and COX-S2V datasets, and a deep Siamese network for FR with a single reference still per person.

This threshold model is adaptive in nature and discriminates between valid and invalid gestures.

The present contribution describes a machine learning approach termed MINLIP. The key insight is to relate ranking criteria as the Area Under the Curve to monotone transformation functions. Consequently, the notion of a Lipschitz smoothness constant is found to be useful for complexity control for learning transformation models, much in a similar vein as the 'margin' is for Support Vector Machines for classification. The use of this model structure in the context of high dimensional data, as well as for estimating non-linear, and additive models based on primal-dual kernel machines, and for sparse models is indicated. Given n observations, the present method solves a quadratic program existing of O(n) constraints and O(n) unknowns, where most existing risk minimization approaches to ranking problems typically result in algorithms with O(n2) constraints or unknowns. We specify the MINLIP method for three different cases: the first one concerns the preference learning problem. Secondly it is specified how to adapt the method to ordinal regression with a finite set of ordered outcomes. Finally, it is shown how the method can be used in the context of survival analysis where one models failure times, typically subject to censoring. The current approach is found to be particularly useful in this context as it can handle, in contrast with the standard statistical model for analyzing survival data, all types of censoring in a straightforward way, and because of the explicit relation with the Proportional Hazard and Accelerated Failure Time models. The advantage of the current method is illustrated on different benchmark data sets, as well as for estimating a model for cancer survival based on different micro-array and clinical data sets.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "Journal of Machine Learning Research", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1648231765", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3264854", "124575237", "11669706", "293897", "29919383", "6226984", "30011852", "123532955", "11522481", "9698374", "5117159", "116197768", "124917461", "15291004", "23176805", "21894485", "16692650", "4735672", "118240393", "5816117", "8822160", "209928701", "14674798", "60906160", "22860466", "16543854", "11113746", "10024263", "44410266", "39072829", "119937163", "35730151", "6840112", "53940663", "121861513", "16162039", "3149474", "35952480", "17720396", "28637672"], "inbound_citations": ["3325493"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17761382"}

In cases of moving tumors their movements have to be mitigated. The method considered in this thesis measures the respiratory motion and calculates the corresponding tumor motion and moves the patient in such a way that the tumor does not move relative to the beam. Some sensors measuring the respiratory motion have large delay times, which can be compensated by prediction filters. The delay time is the time between the measurement and the actual availability of the signal for further use. The accuracy of several prediction filters has been evaluated in this work. The actuator (Treatment Table) also causes errors due to its limited dynamics, therefore, it was modeled and simulated together with the controllers and prediction filters Methods The actuator system, the Protura Treatment Couch (CIVCO Medical Solutions, Kalona, IA, USA) was modeled using methods from Mechanics and was implemented using MATLAB/Simulink (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). Using measurements of the real system unknown parameters were identified. The measurements were carried out using laser triangulation systems (Micro Epsilon Messtechnik GmbH & Co. KG, Ortenburg, Germany). The six different prediction filters considered here were implemented in MATLAB and their parameters were optimized for two different sampling times and one prediction time. The performance of the prediction filters for a single respiration curve is determined by the Root Mean Square (RMS) of the differences (errors) between the estimated value and the actual value at the corresponding time instants. High performance is achieved by having small RMS errors. During the optimization for each parameter combination of the prediction filter the RMS error for 19 different respiration curves were determined and the average over the respiration curves was considered as the performance index. With the optimal parameter combination the behaviour of the RMS of the prediction filters depending on different prediction times were examined. Finally one prediction filter was built into the model of the system and the complete system was simulated. Results The model of the system has an average RMS error of 0.57 mm in longitudinal (x) direction of the actuator system and 0.5 mm in vertical (z) direction. The lateral (y) direction was not measured. The RMS errors of the prediction filters lie, with exception of the normalized Least Mean Squares (nLMS) filter, between 0.4 mm and 0.65 mm for a prediction time of 300 ms. The standard deviations of the RMS error of a prediction filter are larger than the differences between the prediction filters. Except for the Support Vector Regression (SVR) prediction filter the computing times per step are less than 1 ms, while the SVR filter is at nearly 20 ms (MATLAB implementations). The average increase of the error RMS during tumor tracking caused by a delay of 100 ms is 0.54 mm while the reduction using a prediction filter compensating the delay time is 0.53 mm.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3929/ethz-a-010294731", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1559925618", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:56106799"}

This classification is usually performed by a trained specialist who has to analyse and classify the leaf, in a short time, based on experience and visual information.

This work proposes the use of infrared hyperspectral imaging and chemometric tools for discriminant analysis. A fast and real-time method to classify flue-cured Virginia and air-cured Burley tobacco was developed by classifying the leaf based on three criteria: (a) stalk position, (b) leaf colour, and (c) leaf quality; this occurs within 5 seconds. The applicability of the method was evaluated by analysing standard tobacco leaf bundles using near-infrared imaging and Support Vector Machine-Discriminant Analysis (SVM-DA). The models classified the stalk position with a global prediction accuracy of 80.4% for flue-cured Virginia and 88.1% for air-cured Burley. The models for targeting leaf classification by colour presented a global prediction accuracy of 95.9% for flue-cured Virginia and 96.5% for air-cured Burley. For leaf quality, the prediction accuracy ranged from 61.5% to 100.0% for flue-cured Virginia and 78.8% to 100.0% for air-cured Burley. The system was implemented in a tobacco GLT facility for one year to cover an entire crop season and extended to include tobacco bales and leaf bundles. For the most complex classification parameter, leaf quality, flue-cured Virginia models presented a global accuracy of 50.2% to 71.6%. Considering the high complexity of the system and short period of analysis, the obtained accuracy was accepted as suitable when compared to traditional human classification.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1039/C9AY00413K", "venue": null, "journal": "Analytical Methods", "mag_id": "2921203591", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["211080088"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:107498135"}

We propose to train the GANs in a task-aware fashion, specifically for reconstruction tasks. We also show that it is possible to train our model without using any (or much) non-compressed data.

Due to its powerful model representation capabilities, GAN has been introduced to synthesize synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image data, for the real sample is difficult to acquire. Large-scale, high-resolution SAR images play an important role in promoting SAR applications, such as automatic target recognition and image interpretation. However, on account of the difficult training problem of GAN network, especially for SAR images with speckle noise, it is difficult to obtain high-resolution SAR images by simply transfer the net from optical image. Recent studies in other image fields have shown that hierarchical structure is an effective and useful way to decompose a generation task into several smaller subtasks. How to obtain more high-resolution SAR images from limited original samples through GAN is the target of our research. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical GAN network model to generate SAR images, through the multi-stage network, gradually improve the quality of the generated image, and finally obtain high-resolution images. The type and aspect of generated images are determined by the input of condition vectors in the last two stages. In addition, we introduce the triple loss, in which the background loss is used to imitating background clutter noise of SAR image, the condition loss is to make the generated images\u2019 type and aspect become controllable, and the global loss for getting higher image generation quality. The generated images show high similarity with the real samples.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IGARSS.2019.8900494", "venue": "IGARSS 2019 - 2019 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium", "journal": "IGARSS 2019 - 2019 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2986104933", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["26034433", "49568789", "1033682", "8292571", "10894094", "206771128", "1277217"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208035146"}

For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems.

This article explores the application of supervised machine learning (SML) to overcome challenges associated with online data analysis. In SML classifiers are used to categorize and code binary data.

The performance of these classifiers is assessed by examining accuracy, precision, recall, the area under the precision-recall curve, and Krippendorf's Alpha. These indices are obtained by comparing the coding decisions of the classifier to manual coding decisions. The findings indicate that the Linear Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes classifiers outperform the logistic regression classifier. This study also compared the performance of these classifiers based on stratified random samples and random samples of training data. The findings indicate that in smaller training sets stratified random training samples perform better than random training samples, in large training sets (n\u017a=\u017a4000) random samples yield better results. Finally, the Linear Support Vector Machine classifier was trained with 4000 tweets and subsequently used to categorize 578,581 tweets obtained from 430 employees.

In order to alleviate this problem, this paper proposed a fast convolutional denoising autoencoder based extreme learning machine (ELM), called fast convolutional denoising autoencoder (FCDA). In FCDA, the random convolutional hidden nodes are used to reduce the dimension of input data. After that, the proposed denoising ELM autoencoder is used to reconstruct the cleaned data.

We address two open issues: how to estimate propensity scores and assess covariate balance. Using simulations, we compare the performance of PSM and PSW based on logistic regression and machine learning algorithms (CART; Bagging; Boosting; Random Forest; Neural Networks; naive Bayes). Additionally, we consider several measures of covariate balance (Absolute Standardized Average Mean (ASAM) with and without interactions; measures based on the quantile-quantile plots; ratio between variances of propensity scores; area under the curve (AUC)) and assess their ability in predicting the bias of PSM and PSW estimators. We also investigate the importance of tuning of machine learning parameters in the context of propensity score methods. Two simulation designs are employed. In the first, the generating processes are inspired to birth register data used to assess the effect of labor induction on the occurrence of caesarean section. The second exploits more general generating mechanisms. Overall, among the different techniques, random forests performed the best, especially in PSW. Logistic regression and neural networks also showed an excellent performance similar to that of random forests. As for covariate balance, the simplest and commonly used metric, the ASAM, showed a strong correlation with the bias of causal effects estimators. Our findings suggest that researchers should aim at obtaining an ASAM lower than 10% for as many variables as possible.

As a generalization of the spectrum method (denoising method and flipping method), the projection method shows better or comparable performance comparing to the corresponding indefinite kernel methods on a number of real world data sets. Under the Bregman matrix divergence theory, we can find suggested optimal \u03bb in projection method using unconstrained optimization in kernel learning.

It is of paramount importance to authenticate wireless signals at the PHY layer before they proceed through the receiver chain. For that purpose, various waveform, channel, and radio hardware features that are inherent to original wireless signals need to be captured. In the meantime, adversaries become sophisticated with the cognitive radio capability to record, analyze, and manipulate signals before spoofing. Building upon deep learning techniques, this paper introduces a spoofing attack by an adversary pair of a transmitter and a receiver that assume the generator and discriminator roles in the GAN and play a minimax game to generate the best spoofing signals that aim to fool the best trained defense mechanism. The output of this approach is two-fold. From the attacker point of view, a deep learning-based spoofing mechanism is trained to potentially fool a defense mechanism such as RF ingerprinting. From the defender point of view, a deep learning-based defense mechanism is trained against potential spooing attacks when an adversary pair of a transmitter and a receiver cooperates. The probability that the spooing signal is misclassified as the intended signal is measured for random signal, replay, and GAN-based spoofing attacks. Results show that the GAN-based spooing attack provides a major increase in the success probability of wireless signal spoofing even when a deep learning classifier is used as the defense.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1905.01008", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3324921.3329695", "venue": "WiseML 2019", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2963047971,2942592161,2951085669", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["210911512", "209458032", "204852194", "212647697", "202889151", "208231568", "210970844", "204512284"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:145054771"}

Through implementing the classification method, we expect that the great eye tracking method will be designed which will perform well both navigation and selection interactions. Background: Currently, eye tracking is widely used in order to increase immersion and interest of user by supporting natural user interface. Even though conventional eye tracking system is well focused on navigation interaction by tracking pupil movement, there is no breakthrough selection interaction method. Method: To determine classification threshold between intentional and natural blinks, we performed experiment by capturing eye images including intentional and natural blinks from 12 subjects. By analyzing successive eye images, two features such as eye closed duration and pupil size variation after eye open were collected. Then, the classification threshold was determined by performing SVM(Support Vector Machine) training. Results: Experimental results showed that the average detection accuracy of intentional blinks was 97.4% in wearable eye tracking system environments.

Machine learning algorithms provide a solution to tease out the complex relationships between several influencing factors and QoE. This paper proposes a novel QoE estimation model for video service, namely, Boosting Support Vector Regression (BSVR) based QoE model. The purpose of this model is to investigate the effectiveness of combining multiple learners instead of classical individual learner, in order to improve prediction accuracy of the QoE. The BSVR is based on a combination of two principal techniques: Boosting algorithm and Support Vector Regression (SVR). More precisely, multiple SVR models were trained in an iterative boosting algorithm to create a powerful predictive model. In fact, the use of SVRs as weak learners has several advantages. First, the SVR is based on a convex optimization problem, where a global optimal solution exploits a limited number of support vectors, which results in improved prediction accuracy, while maintaining low computational complexity. Second, each SVR uses flexible Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel function to model QoE data efficiently. Comparative evaluation of our proposed BSVR-based QoE model is performed to show its superiority over relevant ensemble learning methods and regression models based on single learner, in terms of prediction accuracy and computational complexity.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/WCNC.2018.8377092", "venue": "2018 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)", "journal": "2018 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2808567040", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5558561", "8161676", "17702192", "31514927", "14666667", "19882713", "27212692", "36385965", "7917823", "743542", "12394453", "6101385", "16020895"], "inbound_citations": ["198932165", "115196454"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49191018"}

Visual sleep scoring provides an initial and tangible illustration of how the brain wave changes across different sleep stages. The main objective of the present study is to design an accurate and robust computer-assisted sleep stage scoring system using single-channel EEG signal by proposing a novel time domain feature named Statistical Behavior of Local Extrema (SBLE). SBLE provides a profound understanding of hidden dynamics of EEG signals by quantifying and symbolizing its local extrema information, extracting and defining various patterns, and statistical analysis of extracted patterns. First, each EEG segment was decomposed into 6 frequency sub-bands (i.e., low-delta, high-delta, theta, alpha, sigma, and beta). Next, SBLE features were separately computed from each sub-band. Then, an optimal feature set with a high rate of accuracy was selected using a supervised Multi-Cluster/Class Feature Selection (MCFS) algorithm. Finally, the selected features were fed to a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification purposes. The benchmark Sleep-EDF dataset and DREAMS Subject Database were employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. The average (\u00b1 variance) accuracy rates were 90.6 \u00b1 4.2%, 91.8 \u00b1 5.0%, 92.8 \u00b1 3.3%, 94.5 \u00b1 3.4%, 97.9 \u00b1 1.4% for six-stage to two-stage sleep classification on Sleep-EDF dataset, respectively.

Multi-class supervised classification requires the collection of reference samples of all available classes in the study area, which is a costly and time consuming process.

PARTICIPANTS: This gathering of participants from academia, government, and industry brought together experts in suicide prevention, clinical trial design, psychometrics, pharmacoepidemiology, and genetics, as well as research psychiatrists involved in studies in studies of psychiatric disorders associated with elevated suicide risk across the life cycle. The process involved reviews of the relevant literature, and a series of 6 breakout sessions focused on specific questions of interest. EVIDENCE: Each of the participants at the meeting received references relevant to the formal presentations (as well as the slides for the presentations) for their review prior to the meeting. In addition, the assessment instruments of suicidal ideation/behavior were reviewed in relationship to standard measures of validity, reliability, and clinical utility, and these findings were discussed at length in relevant breakout groups, in the final plenary session, and in the preparation of the article. Consensus and dissenting views were noted. CONSENSUS PROCESS: Discussion and questions followed each formal presentation during the plenary sessions. Approximately 6 questions per breakout group were prepared in advance by members of the Steering Committee and each breakout group chair. Consensus in the breakout groups was achieved by nominal group process. Consensus recommendations and any dissent were reviewed for each breakout group at the final plenary session. All plenary sessions were recorded and transcribed by a court stenographer. Following the transcript, with input by each of the authors, the final paper went through 14 drafts. The output of the meeting was organized into this brief report and the accompanying full article from which it is distilled. The full article was developed by the authors with feedback from all participants at the meeting and represents a consensus view. Any areas of disagreement at the conference have been noted in the text. CONCLUSIONS: The term suicidality is not as clinically useful as more specific terminology (ideation, behavior, attempts, and suicide). Most participants applauded the FDA's encouragement of standard definitions and definable expectations for investigators and industry sponsors. Further research of available assessment instruments is needed to verify their utility, reliability, and validity in identifying suicide-associated treatment-emergent adverse effects and/or a signal of efficacy in suicide prevention trials. The FDA needs to systematically monitor postmarketing events by encouraging the development of a validated instrument for postmarketing surveillance of suicidal ideation, behavior, and risk. Over time, the FDA, industry, and clinical researchers should evaluate the impact of the requirement that all central nervous system clinical drug trials must include a Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C-CASA)-compatible screening instrument for assessing and documenting the occurrence of treatment-emergent suicidal ideation and behavior. Finally, patients at high risk for suicide can safely be included in clinical trials, if proper precautions are followed.

The proposed method is based on Local Binary Pattern (LBP), and 2D Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), which are used for feature extraction. Afterward, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier distinguishes real and manipulated images. Initial performance was increased by applying Local Binary Pattern (LBP) to the whole image rather than in a blockbased fashion. The proposed model reaches the-state of- the-art in the CASIA TIDE v1.0 database with remarkable results in terms of accuracy.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IPTA.2019.8936108", "venue": "2019 Ninth International Conference on Image Processing Theory, Tools and Applications (IPTA)", "journal": "2019 Ninth International Conference on Image Processing Theory, Tools and Applications (IPTA)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2996381086", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17313316", "67731681", "9655448", "15078155", "4323826", "3149946", "14008455", "27178045", "5819869", "27375254", "206812688", "53007583", "15078155", "63543987", "4205617"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209457289"}

They perform a variety of essential functions as channels, pumps, receptors and energy transducers, and are therefore a major target for drug development. It is estimated that about 20%-30% of a proteome are transmembrane proteins but structure and function have been identified for only a fraction of them. Proteins are distributed to their specific subcellular locations within the cell by highly complex sorting machinery. A crucial first step in revealing the function of a protein is therefore the determination of its subcellular localization. Experimental localization techniques are time consuming and expensive and cannot keep pace with the exponentially growing number of protein sequences. Consequently, computational techniques for subcellular localization prediction have been developed. The vast majority of these prediction algorithms are designed for soluble proteins however, and ignore the characteristic topology of transmembrane proteins. In this thesis, topological models of transmembrane proteins for subcellular localization prediction are constructed and studied, utilizing three different machine learning techniques: Support Vector Machines, Hidden Markov Models and Conditional Random Fields. The objectives of the thesis are: Firstly, to evaluate whether topological models achieve higher prediction accuracies than non-topological models. Secondly, to examine methods to model the topological regions of transmembrane proteins. Thirdly, to study the relationship between topological regions and protein localization. And fourthly, to compare different machine learning techniques in the context of transmembrane protein modeling and subcellular localization prediction. The prediction performances of the constructed models are evaluated on two datasets. The first one is a subset of the mouse proteome, containing transmembrane proteins with experimentally confirmed subcellular localizations.

The unaries of the CRF are provided by a CNN that predicts characters at each position of the output, while higher order terms are provided by another CNN that detects the presence of N-grams. We show that this entire model (CRF, character predictor, N-gram predictor) can be jointly optimised by back-propagating the structured output loss, essentially requiring the system to perform multi-task learning, and training uses purely synthetically generated data. The resulting model is a more accurate system on standard real-world text recognition benchmarks than character prediction alone, setting a benchmark for systems that have not been trained on a particular lexicon.

Existing news recommendation methods achieve personalization by building accurate news representations from news content and user representations from their direct interactions with news (e.g., click), while ignoring the high-order relatedness between users and news. Here we propose a news recommendation method which can enhance the representation learning of users and news by modeling their relatedness in a graph setting. In our method, users and news are both viewed as nodes in a bipartite graph constructed from historical user click behaviors. For news representations, a transformer architecture is first exploited to build news semantic representations.

Classification, an instance of supervised learning, is statistically defined as the problem of identifying to which particular subpopulation a new observation of data belongs. Given the large number of available classification algorithms, their combinations (e.g. ensembles) and possible parameter settings, finding the best method to analyze a new data set has become an ever more challenging task. Typically, finding the best classifier for a given data set involves empirically iterating through all candidate classifiers and choosing the one which provides the best classification accuracies. Clearly, this task is computationally very expensive and the computation cost increases with the addition of each new candidate algorithm. This problem is compounded by the fact that there is not adequate generalizability of these classification methods over data sets from different domains. For example, classifier performance obtained with medical imaging data may not hold for financial data when trying to achieve a similar classification task using the same classifier. How, then, does one efficiently choose a classifier which will provide better classification performance than others? In this context, this study aims to streamline the task of algorithm selection for classification using the meta-learning framework. We propose a methodology to analyze empirically a set of measures of data complexity, known as metafeatures, and investigate their influence on the classification performance of several widely used classifiers. Doing so allows a map of a performance metric to be generated over the metafeature space of data sets. This map is partitioned into regions where some classifiers perform better than others. Once implemented, a new data set can be located in the metafeature continuum and the appropriate classifier for the new data set can be chosen as the one that performs best in that region of the map. The problem of algorithm selection, then, involves merely calculating the metafeatures for a new data set.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/phm-chongqing.2018.00224", "venue": "2018 Prognostics and System Health Management Conference (PHM-Chongqing)", "journal": "2018 Prognostics and System Health Management Conference (PHM-Chongqing)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2909288227", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6069190", "2351470", "3580792", "20210051", "47128183", "120323383", "61399356"], "inbound_citations": ["51965847"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:57753446"}

Attempts at psychologically-tractable computational models of spoken word recognition tend either to ignore time or to transform the temporal input into a spatial representation. This is the approach taken in TRACE (McClelland & Elman, 1986), the model of spoken word recognition that has the broadest and deepest coverage of phenomena in speech perception, spoken word recognition, and lexical parsing of multi-word sequences. TRACE reduplicates featural, phonemic, and lexical inputs at every time step in a potentially very large memory trace, and has rich interconnections (excitatory forward and backward connections between levels and inhibitory links within levels). This leads to a rather extreme proliferation of units and connections that grows dramatically as the lexicon or the memory trace grows. Our starting point is the observation that models of visual object recognition \u2013 including visual word recognition \u2013 have long grappled with the fundamental problem of how to model spatial invariance in human object recognition. We introduce a model that combines one aspect of TRACE \u2013 time-specific phoneme representations \u2013 and higher-level representations that have been used in visual word recognition \u2013 spatially- (here, temporally-) independent diphone and lexical units. This reduces the number of units and connections required by several orders of magnitude relative to TRACE. In this first report, we demonstrate that the model (dubbed TISK, for Time-Invariant String Kernel) achieves reasonable accuracy for the basic TRACE lexicon and successfully models the time course of phonological activation and competition. We close with a discussion of phenomena that the model does not yet successfully simulate (and why), and with novel predictions that follow from this architecture. Keywords: Keywords: Spoken Word Recognition; Time invariance ; Computational models; TRACE. Background Could it be that despite very salient differences, the auditory and visual systems actually rely on the same mechanisms in order to recognize words? One signal has a temporal dimension and is carried by transient sound waves, the other is spatially extended and travels at the speed of light. One signal travels sequentially (over time) through the cochlear nerve, the other in parallel through the optic nerve. In their own dedicated primary cortical regions, however, both arrive at spatial representations \u2013 tonotopic for the auditory system, retinotopic for the visual system. What happens next, according to computational models of visual and spoken word recognition, further hints at some possible unification. Modeling spoken and visual word recognition: TRACE and IA From a psycholinguistic point of view, two early models of word recognition based on the same computational framework have been enormously successful. In the visual domain, the Interactive Activation (IA) model and its extensions (McClelland & Rumelhart, 1981; Grainger & Jacobs, 1996) can account for a large number of robust and sometimes counterintuitive behavioral findings, in a simple and elegant hierarchical structure where units at any level compete to represent the stimulus, and engage in lobbying up and down in the hierarchy. In the auditory domain, TRACE (an extension of the IA framework for speech; McClelland & Elman, 1986) continues to produce new insights into human behavior, including close fits to fine- grained estimates of the time course of spoken word recognition from the visual world paradigm (Allopenna et al., 1998; Dahan, Magnuson, Tanenhaus, & Hogan, 2001); Dahan, Magnuson, & Tanenhaus, 2001). 1 One probably superficial difference between the two models is that between-level connections in IA models of reading typically include both inhibitory and excitatory connections, whereas between-level connections in TRACE It is important to note that current, psychologically tractable models of spoken word recognition do not take real speech as their input. While Grossberg & Myers (2000) have modeled aspects of speech and word processing using real speech inputs, these efforts have not yet yielded a model that can handle speech input and a broad range of phenomena in spoken word recognition. In order to be able to address complex issues in word recognition without first solving all fundamental problems in speech perception, TRACE\u2019s inputs (for example) are pseudo-spectral acoustic-phonetic features that ramp on and off over time, with temporal overlap between adjacent phonemes providing a coarse analog of coarticulation.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "CogSci", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2398420132", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["21047993", "5808461", "5716055", "10598905", "17458800", "1609323", "61453944", "2323710", "88516979", "7819391", "4558242", "7428866", "9854065", "15118845", "13581272", "120094284"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6034102"}

However, recent Internet of Things (IoT) devices and novel biosensors have allowed the continuous collection of the value of the glucose level by means of Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) so that, with the proper Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, glucose evolution can be modeled, thus permitting a forecast of this variable. On the other hand, glycaemia dynamics require that such a model be user-centric and should be recalculated continuously in order to reflect the exact status of the patient, i.e., an \u2018on-the-fly\u2019 approach. In order to avoid, for example, the risk of being disconnected from the Internet, it would be ideal if this task could be performed locally in constrained devices like smartphones, but this would only be feasible if the execution times were fast enough. Therefore, in order to analyze if such a possibility is viable or not, an extensive, passive, CGM study has been carried out with 25 DM1 patients in order to build a solid dataset. Then, some well-known univariate algorithms have been executed in a desktop computer (as a reference) and two constrained devices: a smartphone and a Raspberry Pi, taking into account only past glycaemia data to forecast glucose levels. The results indicate that it is possible to forecast, in a smartphone, a 15-min horizon with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 11.65 mg/dL in just 16.15 s, employing a 10-min sampling of the past 6 h of data and the Random Forest algorithm. With the Raspberry Pi, the computational effort increases to 56.49 s assuming the previously mentioned parameters, but this can be improved to 34.89 s if Support Vector Machines are applied, achieving in this case an RMSE of 19.90 mg/dL.

However, while conceptually similar, theoretical relation between LPA and GCN has not yet been investigated. Here we study the relationship between LPA and GCN in terms of two aspects: (1) feature/label smoothing where we analyze how the feature/label of one node is spread over its neighbors; And, (2) feature/label influence of how much the initial feature/label of one node influences the final feature/label of another node. Based on our theoretical analysis, we propose an end-to-end model that unifies GCN and LPA for node classification. In our unified model, edge weights are learnable, and the LPA serves as regularization to assist the GCN in learning proper edge weights that lead to improved classification performance. Our model can also be seen as learning attention weights based on node labels, which is more task-oriented than existing feature-based attention models.

Predictions of such outcomes are usually conducted by black-box procedures without seriously restricting the link-function class.

Here, we consider this issue for the random forest. Therein, the functional relationship between covariates and response variable is modeled by a weighted sum of the latter. The dependence structure is, however, involved in the weights that are constructed during the tree construction process making the model complex in mathematical analysis.

Oversampling addresses this problem by creating data for the minority class in order to balance the class distribution before the model is trained. The Traditional oversampling approaches are based on Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE), which focus on local information but generates insufficiently realistic data. In contrast, the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) captures the true data distribution in order to generate data for the minority class. However, both approaches are problematic owing to mode collapse and unstable training. To overcome these problems, we propose Conditional Wasserstein GAN- Gradient Penalty (CWGAN-GP), a novel and efficient synthetic oversampling approach for imbalanced datasets, which can be constructed by adding auxiliary conditional information to the WGAN-GP. CWGAN-GP generates more realistic data and overcomes the aforementioned problems. Experiments on 15 different benchmarked datasets and two real imbalanced datasets empirically demonstrate that CWGAN-GP increases the quality of synthetic data; furthermore, our approach outperforms the other oversampling approaches based on three evaluation metrics (F-measure, G-mean, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) for five classifiers. Friedman and Nemenyi post hoc statistical tests also confirm that CWGAN-GP is superior to the other oversampling approaches.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ins.2019.10.014", "venue": "Inf.

Automatic Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is difficult and accuracies with state-of-the art methods are substantially lower than in other areas of text understanding like part-of-speech tagging. One shortcoming of these methods is that they do not utilize substantial sources of background knowledge, such as semantic taxonomies and dictionaries, which are now available in electronic form (the methods largely use shallow syntactic features). Empirical results from the use of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) have repeatedly shown the ability of ILP systems to use diverse sources of background knowledge. In this paper we investigate the use of ILP for WSD in two different ways: (a) as a stand-alone constructor of models for WSD; and (b) to build interesting features, which can then be used by standard model-builders such as SVM. In our experiments we examine a monolingual WSD task using the 32 English verbs contained in the SENSEVAL-3 benchmark data; and a bilingual WSD task using 7 highly ambiguous verbs in machine translation from English to Portuguese. Background knowledge available is from eight sources that provide a wide range of syntactic and semantic information. For both WSD tasks, experimental results show that ILP-constructed models and models built using ILP-generated features have higher accuracies than those obtained using a state-of-the art feature-based technique equipped with shallow syntactic features. This suggests that the use of ILP with diverse sources of background knowledge can provide one way for making substantial progress in the field of automatic WSD.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-540-73847-3_37", "venue": "Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on ILP, Springer-Verlag", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1540480235", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6012701", "7192080", "7594891", "118426129", "9621217", "45984959", "11892605", "3109155", "7397883", "7107728", "119870011", "16762143", "39666367", "61926407", "410080", "8754851", "6326866", "14123920", "59807344", "1487550"], "inbound_citations": ["67045791", "29828273", "17443281", "376807", "207988508", "6660791", "14697500", "40420741", "2134428", "7540141", "4302025"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:704994"}

Non-synonymous SNPs occurring in coding regions result in single amino acid polymorphisms (SAPs) that may affect protein function and lead to pathology. Several methods attempt to estimate the impact of SAPs using different sources of information. Although sequence-based predictors have shown good performance, the quality of these predictions can be further improved by introducing new features derived from three-dimensional protein structures.ResultsIn this paper, we present a structure-based machine learning approach for predicting disease-related SAPs. We have trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) on a set of 3,342 disease-related mutations and 1,644 neutral polymorphisms from 784 protein chains. We use SVM input features derived from the protein\u2019s sequence, structure, and function. After dataset balancing, the structure-based method (SVM-3D) reaches an overall accuracy of 85%, a correlation coefficient of 0.70, and an area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.92. When compared with a similar sequence-based predictor, SVM-3D results in an increase of the overall accuracy and AUC by 3%, and correlation coefficient by 0.06. The robustness of this improvement has been tested on different datasets and in all the cases SVM-3D performs better than previously developed methods even when compared with PolyPhen2, which explicitly considers in input protein structure information.ConclusionThis work demonstrates that structural information can increase the accuracy of disease-related SAPs identification. Our results also quantify the magnitude of improvement on a large dataset. This improvement is in agreement with previously observed results, where structure information enhanced the prediction of protein stability changes upon mutation. Although the structural information contained in the Protein Data Bank is limiting the application and the performance of our structure-based method, we expect that SVM-3D will result in higher accuracy when more structural date become available.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3194195", "pubmed_id": "21992054", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-12-S4-S3", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2035876071", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["33905434", "195213008", "28663513", "6295663", "5636775", "27684348", "33900765", "3173275", "11584666", "7999203", "10669291", "17346750", "642219", "9108227", "18011632", "1960089", "9935127", "86113190", "5585119", "15202800", "15225977", "6469519", "6954060", "14642859", "2083892", "12508714", "13209203", "322133", "38658137", "21384507", "29185760", "16676256", "30541833", "14952090", "6923178"], "inbound_citations": ["213519122", "6503174", "201878041", "1691561", "299862", "18876197", "14011196", "16480766", "146098240", "2245890", "20030119", "19139661", "111384211", "56433336", "3856423", "3154959", "204110192", "13266839", "18427093", "8785840", "212965452", "30390370", "33407339", "16458375", "16803659", "31772788", "29468410", "215525786", "91912389", "214990082", "208581152", "167216675", "41608232", "9085709", "28927754", "11204164", "9367499", "207908573", "12423917", "14651122", "16962013", "201991352", "3637661", "91860649", "203625635", "92562625", "91323861", "1505389", "2417309", "215638333", "146068526", "17615687", "215194343", "5310634"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1884758"}

Our main focus is to handle lexical modifier negation during SWN score calculation for the improvement of classification performance. Thus, we present naive and novel shift approach in which negation acts as both sentiment-bearing word and modifier, and then we shift the score of words from SWN based on their contextual semantic, inferred from neighbouring words. Additionally, we augment negation accounting procedure with a few heuristics for handling the cases in which negation presence does not necessarily mean negation. Experimental results show that the contextual-based SWN feature vector obtained through shift polarity approach alone led to an improved Twitter sentiment analysis system that outperforms the traditional reverse polarity approach by 2\u20136%.

FAE processes the learning examples in blocks of the same size, but it does not have to wait for the batch to be complete in order to adapt its base classification mechanism.

The proposed method enables mapping training data from one domain to another, thereby improving traffic sign detection precision/recall from 0.70/0.66 to 0.83/0.71 for nighttime images.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1911.06486", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IEEECONF44664.2019.9049005", "venue": "2019 53rd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers", "journal": "2019 53rd Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2999771220,2988439637", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["52161643", "700906", "11758569", "211227", "211022860", "206770979", "3719281", "43928340", "53035018", "4714433", "206739910", "44138353", "19244780", "3847983"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208075908"}

This task is posed as a supervised learning problem in which the appearance of areas that correspond to a number of semantic categories are learned from a dataset of manually labelled images. This paper proposes a method that combines a region-based probabilistic graphical model that builds on the recent success of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) in the problem of semantic segmentation, with a salient-points-based bagsof-words paradigm. In a first stage, the image is oversegmented into patches. Then, in a CRF-based formulation we learn both the appearance for each semantic category and the neighbouring relations between patches. In addition to patch features, we also consider information extracted on salient points that are detected in the patch\u2019s vicinity. A visual word is associated to each salient point. Two different types of information are used. First, we consider the local weighted distribution of visual words. Using local (i.e. centred at each patch) word histograms enriches the classical global bags-of-word representation with positional information on word distributions. Second, we consider the un-normalised local distribution of a set of latent topics that are obtained by probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA). This distribution is obtained by the weighted accumulation of the latent topic distributions that are associated to the visual words in the area. The advantage of this second approach lays in the separate representation of the semantic content for each visual word. This allows us to consider the word contributions as independent in the CRF formulation without introducing too strong simplification assumptions. Tests on a publicly available dataset demonstrate the validity of the proposed salient point integration strategies.

To deal with the author's feelings, we suggest enhancing a text tweet with an appropriate image, along with/without text. To generate an image from the text, we first analyze the text tweet. The morpheme analyzer detects the key words and then the thumbnail images related to those keywords are retrieved. The author can select appropriate images for background, avatars and objects. An intermediate image is then generated. After that, our emotion classifier determines the author's feeling in the text tweet using SVM (Support Vector Machine). Based on the emotion in the tweet, we use our own re-coloring method on the generated image. Our augmented visual communication method is implemented on the smart phone and the author can post her own visual tweet with or without text.

Defoliation mapping is particularly challenging in low density ecosystems with high spectral variability due to environmental heterogeneity within relatively short distances. In this study, holm oak defoliation was assessed by classifying two different levels (low and high defoliation trees, with a 30% crown-defoliation threshold) using a combination of multispectral WorldView-2 (WV-2) and Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data in an automated Random Forest (RF) modeling approach. Besides the original remote sensing data, a set of vegetation indices (VI) and ALS-derived structural parameters were derived. Seven predictors of defoliation were selected from the ALS metrics, WV-2 bands, and indices datasets: the height percentile of the tree in which occurs the maximum number of returns, mean values in the tree crown of the Chlorophyll index green, Plant Senescence Reflectance Index, Red Edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Double Peak Index, band 3 of the WV-2 image, and bincentil 70 values. The confusion matrix of the external evaluation achieved the highest overall classification accuracy (86.7%) and the highest Kappa index (0.73). Finally, we produced a predicted tree-defoliation map which was used to establish the relationship between Quercus ilex damage levels and soil variables and management practices. High defoliated trees were more abundant in zones of shallow and compacted soil, with lower silt proportion and Ca concentration. Our results offer to forest managers a tool for the rapid and effective assessment of large areas affected by root rot defoliation in their planning of control and restoration measures aimed at reducing the holm oak mortality of holm oaks in management units.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.foreco.2019.117564", "venue": null, "journal": "Forest Ecology and Management", "mag_id": "2969389613", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202024278"}

However, CNN-based SISR approaches have focused mainly on the design of deep architectures, and the rectified linear units (ReLUs) used in these networks hinder shallow-to-deep information transfer. As a result, these methods are unable to utilize some shallow information, and improving model performance is difficult. To solve the above issues, this paper proposes an image SR reconstruction method based on a generative adversarial network with a residual dense architecture. First, before ReLU activation, the number of feature channels is expanded by a factor of 6~9 using a $1\\times 1$ convolutional layer, which improves the utilization of shallow information. Next, the original discriminator is replaced with a relativistic average discriminator, thereby improving the authenticity of the discriminative network. Finally, preactivation features are used to improve the perceptual loss, thus providing stronger monitoring for brightness consistency and texture restoration. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm improves the utilization of shallow information in a deep network. Structural similarity (SSIM) index evaluations show that the overall utilization of shallow information is increased by 105.52%. In addition, the average runtime is 0.42 sec/frame, nearly 3.6 times faster than those of traditional methods. Moreover, the recovered images have an average natural image quality evaluator value of 3.4 and high perceptual quality, showing that the proposed method is suitable for image reconstruction applications in fields such as agriculture and medicine.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2974759", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3007351453", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["199021677", "73415961", "132039519", "199115204", "58595890", "115199185", "181514330", "4960441", "6593498", "211227", "18874645", "9971732", "1543021", "6540453", "206593506", "206687484", "13271756", "21618854", "206771333", "52957374", "52154773", "1607280", "149735841", "4024970", "980236", "21656084", "164372641", "3619954", "4710341", "8550762", "6145845", "53414958", "52098212", "14636151", "51611077", "16892725", "4493958", "64193", "8282555"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211689094"}

In this paper, an innovative methodology for the generation of a Road Network Definition File (RNDF) using only an obstacle map as input is presented. This RNDF, which relies on a Multiclass Support Vector Machine(MSVM)-based trajectory generation method, will be used by an autonomous vehicle for transporting people in closed, unstructured areas for which no previous information is available, such as residential areas or industrial parks. The advantages of using this technique are the generation of a safe and smooth trajectory graph (making the trip more comfortable for riders by having trajectories pass as far away as possible from obstacles). Moreover, although there exist other previous Support Vector Machine (SVM) path planning methods, this is the first to use a MSVM. The advantages of doing so are that by obtaining a decision boundary for each object in the scene, all possible trajectories are computed and joined to form a graph. This is done through a combination of a Nearest-Neighbor Graph (NNG) and a Relative Neighborhood Graph (RNG). The method was tested with real data and in real conditions, yielding good results. At the end of the paper, results for two kinds of studies are presented. The first set of tests is intended to determine the best parameter values for the proposed methodology. In the second set of evaluations, the approach is compared with other state-of-the-art SVM-based methods, as well as with a classical approach, demonstrating that the method outperforms them in some aspects.

SVM is playing an increasing role in applications to detection problems in various engineering problems, notably in statistical signal processing, pattern recognition, image analysis, and communication systems. In this paper, SVM was applied to the detection of medical ultrasound images in the presence of partially developed speckle noise. The simulation was done for single look and multi-look speckle models to give a complete overlook and insight to the new proposed model of the SVM-based detector. The structure of the SVM was derived and applied to clinical ultrasound images and its performance in terms of the mean square error (MSE) metric was calculated. We showed that the SVM-detected ultrasound images have a very low MSE and are of good quality. The quality of the processed speckled images improved for the multi-look model. Furthermore, the contrast of the SVM detected images was higher than that of the original non-noisy images, indicating that the SVM approach increased the distance between the pixel reflectivity levels (detection hypotheses) in the original images.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "IEC", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1563008572,2238696971", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["44153053", "583205", "2642232", "119711802", "117643475", "14561315", "54155158"], "inbound_citations": ["14120775", "5606227", "15918360"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17500290"}

However, it is not able to identify or monitor the change of central nervous system (CNS) of each individual patient. Resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) has been widely used to investigate brain functions in healthy controls (HCs) and patients with neurological diseases, which could find functional changes following neurorehabilitation. In this paper, a distance-based rehabilitation evaluation method based on rs-fMRI was proposed. Specifically, we posit that in the functional connectivity (FC) space, patients and HCs distribute separately. Linear Support Vector Machines (SVM) were trained on the brain networks to firstly separate patients from HCs. Second, the FC similarity between patients and HCs was measured by the L2-distance of each subject\u2019s feature vector to the separating hyperplane. And finally, statistical analysis of the distance revealed rehabilitation program induced improvements in patients and predicted rehabilitation outcomes. A resting state fMRI dataset with 22 HCs and 18 spinal cord injury (SCI) patients was utilized to validate our method. We built whole-brain networks using 5 atlases to test the robustness of the method and search for features under different node resolution. The classifier successfully separated patients and HCs. Significant improvements in FC after treatment were found for the patients for all 5 atlases using the proposed method, which was consistent with clinical measurements. Furthermore, distance obtained from individual patient\u2019s longitudinal data showed similar trend with each one\u2019s clinical scores, implying the possibility of individual rehabilitation outcome tracking and prediction.

We aimed to estimate: (1) the Red Siskin's historic distribution in Venezuela; (2) the portion of this historic distribution lost to vegetation degradation; and (3) the location of key habitats or areas with both, a high probability of historic occurrence and a low probability of vegetation degradation. We ground-truthed 191 locations and used expert opinion as well as landscape characteristics to classify species' habitat suitability as excellent, good, acceptable, or poor. We fit a Random Forest model (RF) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series to evaluate the accuracy and precision of the expert categorization of habitat suitability. We estimated the probability of historic occurrence by fitting a MaxLike model using 88 presence records (1960-2013) and data on forest cover and aridity index. Of the entire study area, 23% (20,696 km2) had a historic probability of Red Siskin occurrence over 0.743.

In other words, it learns a spatiotemporal video representation, which can be transferred to improve video understanding tasks in small datasets. Our extensive experiments successfully demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on action recognition, leading to significant improvements over the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods.

However, many steganalysis algorithms are constrained to work with only a subset of all possible images in the wild or are known to produce a high false positive rate. This results in blocking any suspected image being an unreasonable policy. A more feasible policy is to filter suspicious images prior to reception by the host machine. However, how does one optimally filter specifically to obfuscate or remove image steganography while avoiding degradation of visual image quality in the case that detection of the image was a false positive? We propose the Deep Digital Steganography Purifier (DDSP), a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which is optimized to destroy steganographic content without compromising the perceptual quality of the original image.

While being a useful tool for modeling pixel interactions, Markov random field (MRF) models encounter challenges in such cases since they assume strong independence of the observed data for tractability, rendering it difficult to take advantage of having multiple correlated views. In this paper we propose joint conditional random field (CRF) for multiple views in the context of virtual view synthesis in image-based rendering. The model is enabled by the adoption of steerable spatial filters for capturing not only the pixel dependence in a single image but also their correlations among multiple views. Furthermore, a novel on-line learning scheme is proposed for the CRF model, which learns the CRF parameters from the same input data for synthesizing virtual views.

When an intention is initiated in the brain or an external stimulus is perceived, the underlying relevant processing alters brain activity. This alteration in brain activity can be reflected in EEG signal. The intention or stimulus perception is therefore classified based on the alteration in brain activity. It might be difficult to classify brain activities in the perception of shape-analogous English letters because the similar shape could lead to less difference in brain activity. In order to explore classification feasibility and classification performance of shape-analogous letters using EEG signal, we performed an experiment of shape-analogous letter perception, in where participants perceived four letters (i.e., 'p', 'q', 'b' and 'd') while EEG signal was recorded. The F-score method was employed to assess the discriminative power for each feature, and a subgroup of features with high discriminative powers was then selected and fed into classifiers. Five classifiers (i.e., k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Random Forest (RF) and AdaBoost (ADA)), which are either pervasive or advanced in the field of machine learning, were utilized to classify brain activities in perception of shape-analogous letters. For each classifier, its parameters and the number of used features were optimized. Based on the performance comparison among the classifiers, Random Forest (RF) classifier achieved a maximal accuracy of 74.1%, but it was not statistically significantly better than the SVM.

Mainly, the blogs assist the variety of interesting and useful information. Because of its increasing growth, blogs can not be categorized effectively. Therefore it is difficult to find relevant topics from the blogs. Hence blogs need to be categorized topically to make easy for readers. Approach: Blog contents are associated with a set of predefined topic ontology keywords. This study proposes categorization of blogs to facilitate easy identification of user expected topic from the massive collection of blogs. Tags, page contents were collected as inputs from the blogs and the blogs were categorized using Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. Most frequent occurrences of topic ontological keywords are used to train the classifier. This approach has effectively improved blog categorization process using SVM. Results: The performance was evaluated for precision and recall for blog categorization based on topic ontology using SVM with Naive Bayes algorithm. It was proved that topic ontology assisted SVM improves the classification accuracy than Naive Bayes algorithm.

Recent advances in sequencing technology have led to a rapid increase in the availability of genomic data, and this, in turn, has led to the introduction of many novel methods for species delimitation. However, these methods have been limited to divergence-only scenarios and have not attempted to evaluate complex modes of speciation, such as those that include gene flow during early stages of divergence (sympatric speciation) or population size changes (founder effect speciation). To address this shortcoming, we introduce delimitR, an approach that enables biologists to infer species boundaries and evaluate the demographic processes that may have led to speciation. delimitR uses the binned multidimensional Site Frequency Spectrum and a machine-learning algorithm (Random Forests) to compare speciation models. We use simulations to evaluate the accuracy of delimitR. When comparing models that include lineage divergence and gene flow for three populations, error rates are near zero with recent divergence times (<100,000 generations) and a modest number of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs; 1,500). When applied to a more complex model set (including divergence, gene flow, and population size changes), error rates are moderate (~0.15 with 10,000 SNPs), and misclassifications are generally between highly similar models. We also evaluate the utility of delimitR using three previously published datasets and find results that corroborate previous findings. Our analyses indicate that delimitR can serve as an important conceptual bridge uniting various investigations into the process of speciation.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1101/356345", "venue": null, "journal": "bioRxiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2811175355", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["22354668", "2078799", "798966", "1187526", "3508635", "20761880", "205253754", "13948536", "22686183", "4417281", "84731013", "34860328", "2633944", "205326921", "51602203", "85858071", "10161990", "1865222", "26829766", "5898032", "8139934", "15456548", "8506138", "7014694", "18874896"], "inbound_citations": ["202851390", "92048760"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:90213461"}

One of the major tasks with the gene expression data is to find groups of co regulated genes whose collective expression is strongly associated with the sample categories or response variables. In this regard, a new supervised attribute clustering algorithm is proposed to find such groups of genes. It directly incorporates the information of sample categories into the attribute clustering process. A new quantitative measure, based on mutual information, is introduced which incorporates the information of sample categories to measure the similarity between attributes. This similarity measure is useful for reducing the redundancy among the attributes. This Clustering algorithm is more effective for analyzing biologically gene clusters with excellent predictive capability.

Accurate and easily reproducible landcover maps enable monitoring of land management decisions and ultimately a greater understanding of landscape ecology. Multi-season Landsat ETM+ imagery from 2001 combined with ancillary topographic and soils data was used to map wetland and riparian systems in the Gallatin Valley of Southwest Montana. Classification Tree Analysis (CTA) and Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB) decision-tree based classification algorithms were used to distinguish wetlands and riparian areas from the rest of the landscape. CTA creates a single classification tree using a one-step-look-ahead procedure to reduce variance. SGB utilized classification errors to refine tree development and incorporated the results of multiple trees into a single best classification. The SGB classification (86.0% overall accuracy) was more effective than CTA (61.7% overall accuracy) at detecting a variety of wetlands and riparian zones present on this landscape. A change detection analysis was performed for the years 1988 and 2001. The change detection used Landsat-based Tasseled Cap (TC) components and change vector analysis (CVA) to identify locations of wetland/riparian gain or loss in the 13-year period. CVA of TC brightness, greenness, and wetness components reduces the compound errors of multi-date classifications by using a threshold value to separate land cover change from spectral variability between 1988 and 2001 imagery. Only the highly changed pixels were classified using 1988 Landsat imagery and ancillary data. These change pixels were then merged with the 2001 classified image to develop a wetland/riparian map for 1988. The high overall accuracy of the 1988 classification (81%) developed with this procedure showed the benefits of this technique for mapping historical landcover features. Comparison of the 1988 and 2001 classifications identified locations where wetlands/riparian areas increased, decreased, or remained stable between these years.

In this thesis, we study specific aspects of five representation learning systems for natural language processing tasks. Representation learning systems are a type of machine learning system dedicated to learn representations of data suitable for other machine learning systems, such as classifiers, to operate upon them. Thus, understanding the behavior of and the abilities learned by representation learning systems is crucial for improving the results on the tasks they are used. The aspects on which we focus are interpretability, robustness, and abilities learned. We are interested in obtaining explanations that allow us to understand how a system makes a decision, what factors from the data and internal to the system affect its robustness, and to what extent it has learned a linguistic ability. To do so, we propose to carry out three types of analyses, namely functional, behavioral, and internal analyses which we link with work on the cognitive science, behavioral science, and neuroscience. We present three case studies. In the first study, we provide a functional explanation of a matrix factorization system that allow us to understand how this system makes a prediction. In our second study, we investigate how robust are three systems when the input data suffers a simple transformation and how certain external and internal factors influence their behavior; these systems are trained for the task of natural language inference. Finally, our third study shows that we are able to extract hypernymy from the word embeddings of a popular ReLe system, while studying the influence that the choice of hypernymy dataset plays in the task. In summary, we advance towards better understanding ReLe systems by providing explanations of their predictive behavior and investigating abilities learned by these systems.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2896106928", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:70175402"}

The forced swimming test of rats or mice is a frequently used behavioral test to evaluate the efficacy of drugs in rats or mice.

We consider that those activity profiles (signals) inherently contain undesired and interference noise that should be removed before feature extraction and classification. We use a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter to filter out that additive noise from the activity profile. The parameters of the FIR filter are obtained via maximizing the accuracy of a classifier that tries to make a discrimination between two classes of the activity profiles (e.g. drug vs. control). We use the kernel Fisher discriminant criterion as a criterion for the discrimination, the DIviding RECTangles (DIRECT) search method for solving the optimization problem and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for the classification task. We show that Autoregressive (AR) coefficients are suitable features for the extraction of the dynamic behavior of rats and also the classification of activity profiles.

(3) The conventional statistics, e.g., correlation coefficient, standard regression coefficient and P values of tests for regression parameters, etc., are inadequate and invalid measures of relative importance of correlated attributes. (4) There are three state-of-the-art methods for determination of relative importance of correlated attributes. They are the Lindeman, Merenda and Gold's method, Breiman's Random Forest and Johnson's relative weight. ::: ::: ::: ::: This article also provides statistical background and almost exhaustive main references on the topic of relative importance of variables scattered in various academic journals in different fields.

It provides information about charge state and local geometry around atoms of interest in operando and extreme conditions. However, in contrast to X-ray diffraction, a quantitative analysis of XANES spectra is rarely performed in the research papers. The reason must be found in the larger amount of time required for the calculation of a single spectrum compared to a diffractogram. For such time-consuming calculations, in the space of several structural parameters, we developed an interpolation approach proposed originally by Smolentsev and Soldatov (2007). The current version of this software, named PyFitIt, is a major upgrade version of FitIt and it is based on machine learning algorithms. We have chosen Jupyter Notebook framework to be friendly for users and at the same time being available for remastering. The analytical work is divided into two steps. First, the series of experimental spectra are analyzed statistically and decomposed into principal components. Second, pure spectral profiles, recovered by principal components, are fitted by theoretical interpolated spectra. We implemented different schemes of choice of nodes for approximation and learning algorithms including Gradient Boosting of Random Trees, Radial Basis Functions and Neural Networks. The fitting procedure can be performed both for a XANES spectrum or for a difference spectrum, thus minimizing the systematic errors of theoretical simulations. The problem of several local minima is addressed in the framework of direct and indirect approaches. Program summary Program title: PyFitIt. Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/ydkgfdc38t.1 Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License 3. Programming language: Python, Jupyter Notebook framework. Nature of problem: Quantitative structural refinements of the X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectra (XANES). Identification of the pure spectral and concentration profiles associated with an experimental XANES dataset. Solution method: The fitting procedure of the experimental XANES spectra or of their differences is realized by means of the inverse and direct approaches based on the training set and approximation machine learning algorithms. The spectral resolution method is based on the PCA technique involving the usage of a target transformation matrix. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: The current version is compatible with the free FDMNES program package for XANES simulations. However, users can prepare their own matrices of spectra calculated by an arbitrary software and the corresponding structural parameters to perform the fitting procedure in PyFitIt. The complete set of examples is distributed along with the program.

Due to the prevalence of the online conversations, mitigating the undesirable effects of juvenile abuse in cyberspace has become inevitable. Using automatic ways to address this kind of crime is challenging and demands efficient and scalable data mining techniques. The problem can be casted as a combination of textual preprocessing in data/text mining and binary classification in machine learning. This thesis proposes two machine learning approaches to deal with the following two issues in the domain of online predator identification: 1) The first problem is gathering a comprehensive set of negative training samples which is unrealistic due to the nature of the problem. This problem is addressed by applying an existing method for semi-supervised anomaly detection that allows the training process based on only one class label. The method was tested on two datasets; 2) The second issue is improving the performance of current binary classification methods in terms of classification accuracy and F1-score. In this regard, we have customized a deep learning approach called Convolutional Neural Network to be used in this domain. Using this approach, we show that the classification performance (F1-score) is improved by almost 1.7% compared to the classification method (Support Vector Machine).

Conventional ensemble algorithms assign to base models a set of deterministic, constant model weights that (1) do not fully account for individual models' varying accuracy across data subgroups, nor (2) provide uncertainty estimates for the ensemble prediction. These shortcomings can yield predictions that are precise but biased, which can negatively impact the performance of the algorithm in real-word applications. In this work, we present an adaptive, probabilistic approach to ensemble learning using a transformed Gaussian process as a prior for the ensemble weights. Given input features, our method optimally combines base models based on their predictive accuracy in the feature space, and provides interpretable estimates of the uncertainty associated with both model selection, as reflected by the ensemble weights, and the overall ensemble predictions. Furthermore, to ensure that this quantification of the model uncertainty is accurate, we propose additional machinery to non-parametrically model the ensemble's predictive cumulative density function (CDF) so that it is consistent with the empirical distribution of the data.

In this paper, the influence of several motor parameters on the synchronization capability is discussed. The discussion about parameters is based on a static slip-torque characteristic and by evaluating time step simulations in a 2-phase rotor reference modelling (dq). An algorithm is used to define whether parameter combinations lead to synchronization or not and a classification method based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) is proposed, in order to define the synchronization capability limits.

Therefore, it is very important the remote sensing based effective monitoring techniques should be developed for the effective observation of land cover and green forests.

In our experimental setup we have utilized 4999sqkm with 2.5m resolution multispectral SPOT-5 imagery of Abbottabad district of Pakistan.

To achieve effective and inexpensive detection for telecom fraud users, we propose an effective and applicable fraud user detection method based on user's Call Detail Record (CDR). The proposed method consists of two modules, namely machine learning module and template detection module. In the machine learning module, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm based on supervised learning is used to classify users using summary characteristics. In the template detection module, a Finite State Machine (FSM) based on fraud user's behavior is used to filter suspicious users, which generated in the machine learning module. After the two modules, fraud users can be detected. We implement our approach and evaluate it on a real-world dataset.

Prediction of A-domain specificity based on the sequence alone can be achieved through sequence signatures or, more accurately, through machine learning methods. We present an improved predictor, based on previous work (NRPSpredictor), that predicts A-domain specificity using Support Vector Machines on four hierarchical levels, ranging from gross physicochemical properties of an A-domain\u2019s substrates down to single amino acid substrates. The three more general levels are predicted with an F-measure better than 0.89 and the most detailed level with an average F-measure of 0.80.

The outdoor action learning module was the third one to take place. In its first part this thesis elaborates on different approaches and conceptual developments of learning, particularly that of working adults. The current findings of systemic-constructivist didactic are particularly taken into consideration, as they are part of the evaluation (design of the survey). A clear distinction between outdoor action learning and other outdoor offers as well as living experience pedagogical approaches is made. To begin with this is done via historical derivations. The methodical-didactical differences of the various approaches are as much presented in detail as the resulting consequences when put to use with adult learners. The role of sports and its relevance for the concept of outdoor action learning is stressed. The results of the research allow the conclusion that applying sports focused action learning has a positive influence on successful learning outcome and assures sustainable transfer into the workplace for each test person.

To target this issue we propose an alternative U-Net based discriminator architecture, borrowing the insights from the segmentation literature. The proposed U-Net based architecture allows to provide detailed per-pixel feedback to the generator while maintaining the global coherence of synthesized images, by providing the global image feedback as well. Empowered by the per-pixel response of the discriminator, we further propose a per-pixel consistency regularization technique based on the CutMix data augmentation, encouraging the U-Net discriminator to focus more on semantic and structural changes between real and fake images. This improves the U-Net discriminator training, further enhancing the quality of generated samples. The novel discriminator improves over the state of the art in terms of the standard distribution and image quality metrics, enabling the generator to synthesize images with varying structure, appearance and levels of detail, maintaining global and local realism.

Methods: Three data mining techniques including the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), and Random Forest (RF) besides to one classic model including Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) was used to predict the monthly incidence of brucellosis in Iran during 2011-2018. We used several criteria (root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R 2 ) and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for appraising the accuracy of prediction and performance of our models. All analysis was done using free statistical software of R3.4.0 Results: Overall 118867 cases (with a mean age of 34.01\u00b11.65 yr) of brucellosis were observed and seven-year incidence rate of brucellosis in Iran was 21.78 (95% CI: 21.66, 21.91). The majority of patients (58.84%) were male and 25-29 yr old. The first three provinces with the highest incidence rate of brucellosis included the following; Kurdistan (71.39 per 100000), Lorestan (68.09 per 100000) and Hamadan (56.24 per 100000). Conclusion: Brucellosis was more common in males, 25-29 aged yr, western provinces and spring months. The disease had a decreasing trend in the last years.

Nevertheless,instance-based learning approach has the obvious disadvantage that is a significant computational cost on large data sets.In summary,only regarding the accuracy of estimating photometric redshifts,ANNs and kernel regression are best choices.In terms of understanding and easy implementation,HyperZ,CMR and polynomial regression are better.In the end,the prospect of algorithms for measuring photometric redshifts is described.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Progress in Astronomy", "mag_id": "43203269", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:115534070"}

The present study has shown how CIELAB color measurement on cassava roots tissue can be used as a non-destructive and very fast technique to quantify the levels of carotenoids in cassava root samples, avoiding the use of more expensive analytical techniques for compound quantification, such as UV-visible spectrophotometry and the HPLC. For this, we used machine learning techniques, associating the colorimetric data (CIELAB) with the data obtained by UV-vis and HPLC, to obtain models of prediction of carotenoids for this type of biomass. Best values of R2 (above 90%) were observed for the predictive variable TCC determined by UV-vis spectrophotometry.

This work proposes and evaluates TermPicker: a novel approach alleviating this situation by recommending vocabulary terms based on the information how other data providers modeled their data as LOD. TermPicker gathers such information and represents it via so- called schema-level patterns (SLPs), which are used to calculate a ranked list of RDF vocabulary term recommendations. The ranking of the recommendations is based either on the machine learning approach \"Learning To Rank\" (L2R) or on the data mining approach \"Association Rule\" mining (AR). TermPicker is evaluated in a two-fold way. First, an automated cross-validation evaluates TermPicker\u2019s prediction based on the Mean Average Precision (MAP) as well as the Mean Reciprocal Rank at the first five positions (MRR@5). Second, a user study examines which of the recommendation methods (L2R vs. AR) aids real users more to reuse RDF vocabulary terms in a practical setting. The participants, i.e., TermPicker\u2019s potential users, are asked to reuse vocabulary terms while modeling three data sets as LOD, but they receive either L2R-based recommendations, AR-based recommendation, or no recommendations. The results of the cross-validation show that using SLPs, TermPicker achieves 35% higher MAP and MRR@5 values compared to using solely the features based on the typical reuse strategies. Both the L2R-based and the AR-based recommendation methods were able to calculate lists of recommendations with MAP = 0.75 and MRR@5 = 0.80. However, the results of the user study show that the majority of the participants favor the AR-based recommendations.

However, they suffer the drawback of delays in making data available to the analysis, due to inefficiencies in data collection procedures. In this sense, the integration of clinical based registries with unconventional data sources like newspaper articles has the advantage of making the system more useful for early alerting. Usage of such sources is difficult since information is only available in the form of free natural-language documents rather than structured databases as required by traditional data mining techniques. Information Extraction (IE) addresses the problem of transforming a corpus of textual documents into a more structured database. In this paper, on a corpora of Italian newspapers articles related to choking in children due to ingestion/inhalation of foreign body we compared the performance of three IE algorithms- (a) a classical rule based system which requires a manual annotation of the rules; (ii) a rule based system which allows for the automatic building of rules; (b) a machine learning method based on Support Vector Machine.

The method is especially significant as it applies directly to nonlinear problem solving, where the search space is complete. We present HAMLET, a system where we implemented this learning method, within the context of the PRODIGY architecture. HAMLET learns control rules for individual decisions corresponding to new learning opportunities offered by the nonlinear problem solver that go beyond the linear one. These opportunities involve, among other issues, completeness, quality of plans, and opportunistic decision making.

Sample selection is a feasible strategy to overcome the problem. In order to reduce training samples without sacrificing recognition accuracy, this paper presents a novel sample selection approach named Kernel Subclass Convex Hull (KSCH) sample selection approach, which tries to select boundary samples of each class convex hull. The sample selection idea is derived from the geometrical explanation of SVM. In geometry, constructing a SVM problem can be converted to a problem of computing the nearest points between two convex hulls. Therefore, each class convex hull virtually determines the separating plane of SVM. Since a convex hull of a set can be only constructed by boundary samples of the convex hull, using boundary samples of each class to train SVM will be equivalent to using all training samples to train the classifier. Based on the idea, KSCH method iteratively select boundary samples of each class convex hull in high-dimensional space (induced by kernel trick). The convex hull of chosen set is called subclass convex hull. With the increasing of the size of chosen set, each subclass convex hull can rapidly approximate each class convex hull. So the samples selected by our method can efficiently represent original training set and support SVM classification. Experimental results on MIT-CBCL face database and UMIST face database show that KSCH sample selection method can select fewer high-quality samples to maintain the recognition accuracy of SVM.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2010.01.008", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2079407029", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["53535946", "55443630", "40958029", "13862083", "31978161", "25514795", "10197796", "15459022", "6441960", "9387223", "109839323", "73535245", "10570350", "10338789", "1913254", "14066149"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:207101578"}

Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is an unsupervised approach that utilizes two ANNs in one system. The first neural network is called the Discriminator and evaluates the quality of images generated by the other network, the Generator. However, image generation has no fixed solution, making evaluation difficult. This can be addressed through comparing two GAN models by letting them evaluate each other; the paper proposes a custom implementation of this evaluation method that allows for comparison between two GAN models both overall and throughout the learning process. GANs have a reputation for being hard to train. One concrete problem is main- taining the balance between the Generator and Discriminator. As for humans, it is easier to rate the quality of images then it is to actually create them. A good evaluator is necessary, but it must not out-power the generative model. The paper explores two main approaches to achieve a better balanced GAN model. The first method makes guided alterations to the usually random input of the Generator. The second method adds an additional Discriminator to the model. Techniques based on both of these methods were shown to effectively guide the training pro- cess and creating strong models that outperformed regular GANs when compared using the previously mentioned evaluation method.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2786959308", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:64791882"}

In many big data systems, iterative re-training high dimensional data from scratch is computationally infeasible since constant data stream ingestion on top of a historical data pool increases the training time exponentially. Therefore, the need arises on how to retain past learning and fast update the model incrementally based on the new data. Also, the current machine learning approaches do the model prediction without providing a comprehensive root cause analysis. To resolve these limitations, our framework lays foundations on an ensemble process between stream data with historical batch data for an incremental lifelong learning (LML) model. A cancer patient\u2019s pathological tests like blood, DNA, urine or tissue analysis provide a unique signature based on the DNA combinations. Our analysis allows personalized and targeted medications and achieves a therapeutic response. Model is evaluated through data from The National Cancer Institute\u2019s Genomic Data Commons unified data repository. The aim is to prescribe personalized medicine based on the thousands of genotype and phenotype parameters for each patient. The model uses a dimension reduction method to reduce training time at an online sliding window setting. We identify the Gleason score as a determining factor for cancer possibility and substantiate our claim through Lilliefors and Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. We present clustering and Random Decision Forest results. The model\u2019s prediction accuracy is compared with standard machine learning algorithms for numeric and categorical fields. We propose an ensemble framework of stream and batch data for incremental lifelong learning. The framework successively applies first streaming clustering technique and then Random Decision Forest Regressor/Classifier to isolate anomalous patient data and provides reasoning through root cause analysis by feature correlations with an aim to improve the overall survival rate.

In this study, three different variants of support vector machine viz., SVM, Proximal Support Vector Machine (PSVM) and L2-Support Vector Machine - Modified Finite Newton (L2-SVM-MFN) have been applied on the Mandakini River Basin in Uttarakhand, India to carry out the landslide susceptibility mapping. Eight thematic layers such as elevation, slope, aspect, drainages, geology/lithology, buffer of thrusts/faults, buffer of streams and soil along with the past landslide data were mapped in GIS environment and used for landslide susceptibility mapping in MATLAB. The study area covering 1625 km2 has merely 0.11% of area under landslides. There are 2009 pixels for past landslides out of which 50% (1000) landslides were considered as training set while remaining 50% as testing set. The performance of these techniques has been evaluated and the computational results show that L2-SVM-MFN obtains higher prediction values (0.829) of receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-area under the curve) as compared to 0.807 for PSVM model and 0.79 for SVM. The results obtained from L2-SVM-MFN model are found to be superior than other SVM prediction models and suggest the usefulness of this technique to problem of landslide susceptibility mapping where training data is very less.

The first aim of this study is to provide a machine learning method that can distinguish the dialect from acoustic productions of sonorant sounds. The second aim is to determine the classification accuracy of dialects from the temporal and spectral information of a single sonorant sound and the classification accuracy of dialects using additional co-articulatory information from the adjacent vowel. To this end, this paper provides two classification approaches. The first classification approach aims to distinguish two Greek dialects, namely Athenian Greek, the prototypical form of Standard Modern Greek and Cypriot Greek using measures of temporal and spectral information (i.e., spectral moments) from four sonorant consonants /m n l r/. The second classification study aims to distinguish the dialects using coarticulatory information (e.g., formants frequencies F1-F5, F0, etc.) from the adjacent vowel in addition to spectral and temporal information from sonorants. In both classification approaches, we have employed Deep Neural Networks, which we compared with Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and Decision Trees. The findings show that neural networks distinguish the two dialects using a combination of spectral moments, temporal information, and formant frequency information with 81\\% classification accuracy, which is a 14% accuracy gain over employing temporal properties and spectral moments alone.

Most studies have focussed on phase recognition modelling of the laparoscopic cholecystectomy, because of its standard and frequent execution. To demonstrate the broad applicability of SPM, more diverse and complex procedures need to be studied. The aim of this study is to investigate the accuracy in which we can recognise and extract surgical phases in laparoscopic hysterectomies (LHs) with inherent variability in procedure time. To show the applicability of the approach, the model was used to automatically predict surgical end-times.MethodsA dataset of 40 video-recorded LHs was manually annotated for instrument use and divided into ten surgical phases. The use of instruments provided the feature input for building a Random Forest surgical phase recognition model that was trained to automatically recognise surgical phases. Tenfold cross-validation was performed to optimise the model for predicting the surgical end-time throughout the procedure.ResultsAverage surgery time is 128 \u00b1 27 min. Large variability within specific phases is seen. Overall, the Random Forest model reaches an accuracy of 77% recognising the current phase in the procedure. Six of the phases are predicted accurately over 80% of their duration. When predicting the surgical end-time, on average an error of 16 \u00b1 13 min is reached throughout the procedure.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates an intra-operative approach to recognise surgical phases in 40 laparoscopic hysterectomy cases based on instrument usage data.

However, formalisms based more closely on neural computation\u2014including connectionist or neural-network models\u2014have proven more effective at capturing the effects of brain damage on cognition. In such models, cognitive processes take the form of cooperative and competitive interactions among large numbers of simple, neuron-like processing units. Many such models use distributed representations in which cognitive entities like words, objects and concepts, are encoded by alternative, overlapping patterns of activity. On this approach, the internal representations needed to perform various tasks are not stipulated in advance but are learned though feedback and interaction with the environment. Connectionist models have been applied successfully to a wide range of neuropsychological domains, including perception, attention, language, memory, executive control, and action.

As a consequence, available data is often of limited size compared to the difficulty of the prediction tasks. This makes overfitting a particularly important issue in several face-related machine learning applications. In this PhD, we introduce a novel method for multi-dimensional label regression, namely Hard Multi-Task Metric Learning for Kernel Regression (H-MT-MLKR). Our proposed method has been designed taking a particular focus on overfitting reduction. The Metric Learning for Kernel Regression method (MLKR) that has been proposed by Kilian Q. Weinberger in 2007 aims at learning a subspace for minimizing the quadratic training error of a Nadaraya-Watson estimator. In our method, we extend MLKR for multi-dimensional label regression by adding a novel multi-task regularization that reduces the degrees of freedom of the learned model along with potential overfitting. We evaluate our regression method on two different applications, namely landmark localization and Action Unit intensity prediction. We also present our work on automatic emotion prediction in a continuous space which is based on the Nadaraya-Watson estimator as well.

Discovered about a decade ago, the activity of these cells was found to correlate with the allocentric position of the animal by forming a regular, hexagonal lattice of firing fields across the entire environment. Due to this unusual behavior and the proximity of the entorhinal cortex to other brain regions that also contain cells with spatially correlated activity grid cells are commonly recognized as an important element of a neuronal system for navigation. Existing computational models of grid cells share this view and typically describe the behavior of grid cells as a path ::: integration component of such a system. ::: ::: This work presents a new, complementary computational model of grid cells. In contrast to existing models it does not assume that grid cells are a specialized component of a navigational system. Instead, it assumes that the activity of grid cells reflects a general principle by which neurons in higher order parts of the cortex process information. The proposed model extends the growing neural gas approach by Bernd Fritzke into a recursive algorithm that describes the joint behavior of grid cells in a group as well as the processes within each individual cell. The work demonstrates that the choosen approach is able to model the characteristic behavior of grid cells and other cells, that also exhibit grid cell-like firing patterns but whose activity does not correlate with the animal's location in the environment. ::: ::: The computational model presented in this work represents a general information processing scheme that is not limited to the description of grid cell behavior.

The breakthroughs in the development of graphical processing units have made it possible to train DCNNs quickly for state-of-the-art tasks such as image classification, speech recognition, and many others. However, to solve complex problems, these multilayered convolutional neural networks become increasingly large, complex, and abstract. We propose methods to improve the performance of neural networks while reducing their dimensionality, enabling a better understanding of the learning process. To leverage the extensive training, as well as strengths of several pretrained models, we explored new approaches for combining features from fully connected layers of models with heterogeneous architectures. The proposed approach combines features extracted from the penultimate fully connected layer from three different DCNNs. We merge the features of all three DCNNs together and apply principal component analysis or linear discriminant analysis. Our approach aims to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vector and find the smallest feature vector dimension that can maintain the classifier performance. For this task we use a linear Support Vector Machine as a classifier. We also investigate whether it is advantageous to fuse only penultimate fully connected layers, or to perform fusion based on other fully connected layers using multiple homogenous or heterogeneous networks. The results show that the fusion method outperformed both individual networks in terms of accuracy and computational time in all of our various trial sizes. Overall our fusion methods are faster and more accurate than individual networks in both training and testing.

The Gene Ontology (GO) provides a common controlled vocabulary for describing gene function however the process for annotating proteins with GO terms is usually through a tedious manual curation process by trained professional annotators. With the wealth of genomic data that are now available, there is a need for accurate automated annotation methods. In this paper, we propose a method for automatically predicting GO terms for proteins by applying statistical pattern recognition techniques. We employ protein functional domains as features and learn independent Support Vector Machine classifiers for each GO term.

KDML constructs a direct nonlinear mapping from the original input space into a feature space based on kernel density estimation. The nonlinear mapping in KDML embodies established distance measures between probability density functions, and leads to correct classification on datasets for which linear metric learning methods would fail. It addresses the severe challenge to kNN when features are from heterogeneous domains and, as a result, the Euclidean or Mahalanobis distance between original feature vectors is not meaningful. Existing metric learning algorithms can then be applied to the KDML features. We also propose an integrated optimization algorithm that learns not only the Mahalanobis matrix but also kernel bandwidths, the only hyper-parameters in the nonlinear mapping. KDML can naturally handle not only numerical features, but also categorical ones, which is rarely found in previous metric learning algorithms.

However, whether specific immune mediators play an early role in the etiopathogenesis of these disorders remains unknown. Methods In a longitudinal design, component-wise gradient boosting was used to build models of depression, assessed by the Mood-Feelings Questionnaire-Child (MFQC), and anxiety, assessed by the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) in 254 adolescents from a large set of candidate predictors, including sex, race, 39 inflammatory proteins, and the interactions between those proteins and time. Each model was reduced via backward elimination to maximize parsimony and generalizability. Results Component-wise gradient boosting and model reduction found that female sex, growth- regulated oncogene (GRO), and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha) predicted depression, while female sex predicted anxiety. Limitations Differential onset of puberty as well as a lack of control for menstrual cycle may also have been responsible for differences between males and females in the present study.

The conventional methods for RF estimation are mainly based on radio propagation models, which suffer from low accuracy and coarse granularity. Distinguished from existing methods, we propose sparsely self-supervised generative adversarial nets (SS-GAN), a novel data-driven model to generate the RF maps of an area from irregularly distributed measurement samples. SS-GAN meticulously adopts the standard GAN framework, where the generator learns the distribution of true observations under the guidance of the discriminator that discriminates whether the input data is from real samples or from generated outputs. Competition in the minmax game between generator and discriminator drives them to improve their capability, until the generator is indistinguishable from the true RF distribution. Specifically, on top of the GAN framework, SS-GAN carries out a variety of operations to enhance the estimation: (1) In addition to observations of the measured RF coverage and RF interference, SS-GAN also employs a collection of crucial auxiliary information (e.g., geographic data) as additional input features to the GAN framework so as to precisely characterize the RF environment; (2) To dampen the training instability, a new lightweight reconstruction loss is introduced to the objective function of SS-GAN rather than solely using the adversarial loss, which aims to impose a weak supervision on the generated RF maps according to estimation accuracy; (3) Moreover, SS-GAN designs an innovative sparsely self-supervised ( ${\\mathcal {SS}}$ ) learning mechanism that facilitates the validation of the estimated results for a model lacking direct ground truth knowledge. Extensive experiments on a real-world 4G LTE dataset demonstrate that SS-GAN can substantially improve the estimation accuracy over the state-of-the-art baselines.

At a second stage, a stereovision matching process is designed based on the application of four stereovision matching constraints: epipolarity, similarity, uniqueness and smoothness. The epipolarity guides the process. The similarity and uniqueness are mapped once again through the Support Vector Machines, but under a different way to the previous case; after this an initial disparity map is obtained. This map is later filtered by applying the Discrete Simulated Annealing framework where the smoothness constraint is conveniently mapped. The combination of the segmentation and stereovision matching approaches makes the main contribution.

Due to the nonlinear transformations and the unique memory mechanism, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) can consider a window of history when learning discriminative features, which suggests that the LSTM is suitable for state estimation of target objects as they move around. This paper focuses on association based MOT, and we propose a novel Siamese LSTM Network to interpret both temporal and spatial components nonlinearly by learning the feature of trajectories, and outputs the similarity score of two trajectories for data association. In addition, we also introduce an online metric learning scheme to update the state estimation of each trajectory dynamically.

However, these algorithms are criticized for the low accuracy when the number of pathogenic genes is limited. To overcome this problem, we propose the Transfer Learning based algorithm for Gene Prioritization without pathogenic genes in target cancer (called TLGP) under the assumption that knowledge shared by similar cancers can improve the accuracy of gene prioritization. Specifically, we first calculate the affinity matrix between target domain and source domain, which quantifies the similarity of genes among various cancers. Then, the TLGP algorithm automatically learns a fusion network in target cancer via fusing affinity matrix, pathogenic genes and genomic data of source cancers. Finally, we prioritize genes in target cancer by node ranking algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy of TLGP is at least 6.5% higher than that of state-of-the-art approaches.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/BIBM47256.2019.8983154", "venue": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)", "journal": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3005093584", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["195657509", "10417120", "59307264", "57764181", "18819569", "123017570", "125488381", "2551728", "2185523", "13427192", "49355720", "508435", "17304065", "9661732", "1508503", "20832364", "12437798", "15975972", "740063", "1846738", "127227", "206769089", "47325215", "30950680", "4428232"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211058521"}

A ubiquitylation like PTM, sumoylation also may affect gene mapping, expression and genomic replication. Over the past two decades, machine learning has been widely employed in protein ubiquitylation and sumoylation site prediction tools. These existing tools require feature engineering, but failed to provide general interpretable features and probably underutilized the growing amount of data. This prompted us to propose a deep learning-based model that integrates multiple convolution and fully-connected layers of seven supervised learning sub-models to extract deep representations from protein sequences and physico-chemical properties (PCPs). Especially, we divided PCPs into 6 clusters and customized deep networks accordingly for handling the high correlations among one cluster. A stacking ensemble strategy was applied to combine these deep representations to make prediction.

However, recent papers on a new approach called Meta-Interpretive Learning have demonstrated that both predicate invention and learning recursive predicates can be efficiently implemented for various fragments of definite clause logic using a form of abduction within a meta-interpreter. This paper explores the effect of bias reformulation produced by Meta-Interpretive Learning on a series of Program Induction tasks involving string transformations. These tasks have real-world applications in the use of spreadsheet technology. The existing implementation of program induction in Microsoft's FlashFill (part of Excel 2013) already has strong performance on this problem, and performs one-shot learning, in which a simple transformation program is generated from a single example instance and applied to the remainder of the column in a spreadsheet. However, no existing technique has been demonstrated to improve learning performance over a series of tasks in the way humans do. In this paper we show how a functional variant of the recently developed MetagolD system can be applied to this task. In experiments we study a regime of layered bias reformulation in which size-bounds of hypotheses are successively relaxed in each layer and learned programs re-use invented predicates from previous layers. Results indicate that this approach leads to consistent speed increases in learning, more compact definitions and consistently higher predictive accuracy over successive layers. Comparison to both FlashFill and human performance indicates that the new system, MetagolDF, has performance approaching the skill level of both an existing commercial system and that of humans on one-shot learning over the same tasks.

Managing these huge numbers of incoming bug reports is a challenging task. Dealing with these reports manually consumes time and resources which leads to delaying the resolution of important bugs which are crucial and need to be identified and resolved earlier. Bug triaging is an important process in software maintenance. Some bugs are important and need to be fixed right away, whereas others are minor and their fixes could be postponed until resources are available. Most automatic bug assignment approaches do not take the priority of bug reports in their consideration. Assigning bug reports based on their priority may play an important role in enhancing the bug triaging process. In this paper, we present an approach to predict the priority of a reported bug using different machine learning algorithms namely Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. We also investigate the effect of using two feature sets on the classification accuracy. We conduct experimental evaluation using open-source projects namely Eclipse and Fire fox.

The probability of observing a positive response, however, has proven variable during the day, with comparable timing of the minima and maxima in VS/UWS and MCS. We verified if measures of sympathetic/parasympathetic balance are possible independent variables on which the occurrence of a pursuit response could depend and be predicted.MethodsFourteen subjects in VS/UWS and sixteen in MCS for more than one year were studied. A mirror was used to test the pursuit response for a total 231 useful trials. Non-invasive measures of the sympathetic/parasympathetic functional state (Heart rate variability descriptors nuLF and peakLF) used in the study of responsiveness in VS/UWS and MCS subjects were recorded and processed by descriptive statistics and advanced Support Vector Machine (SVM).ResultsA pursuit response was observed in 33% and 78.2% of subjects in VS or MCS, respectively.

Two major disturbances are considered, voltage sag and transient which constitutes major power quality problems worldwide. Both of these problems are caused by mother nature and the equipment in power industry. The proposed technique employed in this project to classify the causes of voltage sag and transient is by using a statistical method, Support Vector Machine. A wavelet technique based on the Daubechies mother wavelet has been used as the feature extraction method. Each type of disturbances is extracted using the chosen dB mother wavelet. Sampling data are taken from the simulated IEEE 13 and 30 bus distribution data. The data are simulated using PSCAD and the SVM employed to classify the cause of each disturbance is written using Matlab script code.

This paper explores different machine learning techniques for predicting the heating load and cooling load of residential buildings. Among these methods, we focus on advanced techniques like Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and a hybrid model of MARS and ELM along with a comparison of the results with those of more conventional methods like linear regression, neural network, Gaussian processes and Radial Basis Function Network. The MARS model is a non-parametric regression model that splits the data and fits each interval into a basis function and ELM is similar to a Single Layer Feed-forward Neural Network except that in ELM randomly assigned input weights are not updated. As an improvement, we have tried a hybrid model that uses MARS to evaluate the importance of every parameter in the prediction and these important parameters have been fed to the ELM to build hybrid model and it can be seen that this boosts the ELM performance to match up to the accuracy of MARS with lesser computation time.

The most significant subset of features are selected as inputs to the four classifiers. Outputs of these classifiers are then combined for the final detection of the AF episodes.

In this paper, a novel prediction method named NCA-BOA-RF is proposed using the Neighborhood Components Analysis (NCA) and the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BOA)-optimized Random Forest (RF) model. Firstly, the NCA is applied to select feature variables for traffic incident duration. Then, RF model is trained based on the training set constructed using feature variables, and the BOA is employed to optimize the RF parameters. Finally, confusion matrix is introduced to measure the optimized RF model performance and compare with other methods.

In this work, we propose a novel similarity metric (TexSimAR), which computes the similarity value between two consecutive US images by correlating the parametric representation of the image-texture instead of the image itself. The purpose of this approach is to capture and compare the dynamics in the texture characteristics of two US images. We modelled these dynamics using a parametrical auto-regressive (AR) model.

Fortunately, kernel methods provide the designer with formidable tools to tackle such complexity. Among others, tree kernels (TKs) have been successfully applied for representing structured data in diverse domains, ranging from bioinformatics and data mining to natural language processing. One drawback of such methods is that learning with them typically requires a large number of kernel computations (quadratic in the number of training examples) between training examples. However, in practice substructures often repeat in the data which makes it possible to avoid a large number of redundant kernel evaluations. In this paper, we propose the use of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to compactly represent trees in the training algorithm of Support Vector Machines. In particular, we use DAGs for each iteration of the cutting plane algorithm (CPA) to encode the model composed by a set of trees. This enables DAG kernels to efficiently evaluate TKs between the current model and a given training tree. Consequently, the amount of total computation is reduced by avoiding redundant evaluations over shared substructures. We provide theory and algorithms to formally characterize the above idea, which we tested on several datasets. The empirical results confirm the benefits of the approach in terms of significant speedups over previous state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we propose an alternative sampling strategy within the CPA to address the class-imbalance problem, which coupled with fast learning methods provides a viable TK learning framework for a large class of real-world applications.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10618-012-0276-8", "venue": "Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery", "journal": "Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2125555484", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["12056314", "2026296", "5424754", "16509032", "7740159", "7506864", "9139465", "1043861", "207168225", "10239406", "1115550", "8105307", "14032548", "6165849", "1192563", "252796", "2183515", "574838", "6265951", "17888051", "7425249", "2340513", "7888363", "2486369", "2939658", "15644124", "536043", "17896049", "1942527", "15135183", "14900181", "1901669", "7792256", "5522142", "13444243", "10075797", "17671150", "16268556", "3229593", "139968", "2566941", "510619", "13461880", "3194807", "9929910", "1900137"], "inbound_citations": ["5839728", "16156851", "744667", "52039417", "7999515", "13081252", "12758635", "14561633", "30059555"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12138100"}

Gene expression microarray data is expected to significantly aid in the development of efficient cancer diagnosis and classification platforms. Key issues that need to be addressed under such circumstances are the efficient selection of a small subset of genes that might profoundly contribute to disease identification from the thousand of genes measured on microarrays that are inherently noisy. This research deals with finding a small subset of informative genes from gene expression data which maximizes the classification accuracy. This research proposed a hybrid between Genetic Algorithm and Support Vector Machine classifier for selecting an optimal small subset of informative genes and classifying the optimal subset. Two benchmark data sets were used to evaluate the usefulness of the approach for small and high dimension data. Although, the experimental results showed that the hybrid method performed better than some of the best previous methods on small dimensional data, its performance deteriorated significantly on the higher dimensional data. An improved version of the hybrid method was designed by introducing a new algorithm for features selection based on improved chromosome representation to replace the original algorithm on the hybrid method which appeared to perform poorly on high dimensional data. The results of the gene expression microarray classification demonstrated that the proposed method performed better than the original and the previous methods.

Numerous research efforts have focused on designing algorithms to improve the F1 score, but have any mechanism to control precision or recall individually. However, many applications have precision/recall preferences. For instance, an email spam classifier requires a precision of 0.9 to mitigate the false dismissal of useful emails. In this paper, we propose a method that allows to specify a precision/recall preference while maximising the F1 score. Our key idea is that we divide the semi-supervised learning process into multiple rounds of supervised learning, and the classifier learned at each round is calibrated using a sub-set of the labeled dataset before we use it on the unlabeled dataset for enlarging the training dataset. Our idea is applicable to a number of learning models such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Bayesian networks and neural networks. We focus our research and the implementation of our idea on SVMs. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our method. The experimental results show that our method can train classifiers with a precision/recall preference, while the popular semi-supervised SVM training algorithm (which we use as the baseline) cannot. When we specify the precision preference and the recall preference to be the same, which indicates to maximise the F1 score only as the baseline does, our method achieves better or similar F1 scores to the baseline. An additional advantage of our method is that it converges much faster than the baseline.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/2661829.2661977", "venue": "CIKM '14", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2109982174", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16025939", "11326549", "9477357", "20418030", "14727192", "546373", "61041343", "14591650", "5667586", "58153557", "5155714", "53306004", "7635678", "15148126", "4362821", "371647", "1689546", "207165665"], "inbound_citations": ["27156155", "10670253", "14052569"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:74754"}

The BubGAN is trained initially on a labeled bubble dataset consisting of ten thousand images. By learning the distribution of these bubbles, the BubGAN can generate more realistic bubbles compared to the conventional models used in the literature. The trained BubGAN is conditioned on bubble feature parameters and has full control of bubble properties in terms of aspect ratio, rotation angle, circularity and edge ratio. A million bubble dataset is pre-generated using the trained BubGAN. One can then assemble realistic bubbly flow images using this dataset and associated image processing tool. These images contain detailed bubble information, therefore do not require additional manual labeling. This is more useful compared with the conventional GAN which generates images without labeling information.

In this paper, two novel methods are proposed to model the statistics of the SVM regression error occurring on each image sample.

Method: This work was carried out in the transition zone between the phosphate plateau and the plain of Tadla, a site of more than 124,000 ha. To achieve the objectives set, we used Landsat-8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) data sharpened to 15 m. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifications were applied to the 10-period Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) series. Results: It is shown that agriculture in Morocco is highly dependent on irrigation. In the classified map, it can be observed that the southern region, a zone with a semi-arid climate, which generally relies on irrigation, is very developed in agriculture, whereas in the north most of the soil is bared with cereals that mainly depend on rainfall.

Traditionally, placement of soil into appropriate hydrologic groups is based on the judgement of soil scientists, primarily relying on their interpretation of guidelines published by regional or national agencies. As a result, large-scale mapping of hydrologic soil groups results in widespread inconsistencies and inaccuracies. This paper presents an application of machine learning for classification of soil into hydrologic groups. Based on features such as percentages of sand, silt and clay, and the value of saturated hydraulic conductivity, machine learning models were trained to classify soil into four hydrologic groups. The results of the classification obtained using algorithms such as k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine with Gaussian Kernel, Decision Trees, Classification Bagged Ensembles and TreeBagger (Random Forest) were compared to those obtained using estimation based on soil texture.

Despite the encouraging results achieved by these methods, many functions still have a very low number of verified protein annotations, leading to a pronounced imbalance between annotated and unannotated proteins. Furthermore, functional taxonomies rarely report negative annotations. This leaves ill defined the set of negative examples, which is crucial for training the majority of machine learning methods. In practice, neglecting data imbalance and the problem of selecing negative examples can strongly limit the accuracy of protein function prediction. Results: We present a novel approach combining a suitable imbalance-aware classification strategy, addressing the scarcity of annotated proteins, with an active learning strategy for selecting the most reliable negative examples.

Moreover, experiments were rarely assessed by 10-fold cross-validation trials. In this work, based on the Discretized Interpretable Multilayer Perceptron (DIMLP), experiments were performed on 10 repetitions of stratified 10-fold cross-validation trials over 25 binary classification problems. The DIMLP architecture allowed us to produce rules from DIMLP ensembles, boosted shallow trees (BSTs), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The complexity of rulesets was measured with the average number of generated rules and average number of antecedents per rule. From the 25 used classification problems, the most complex rulesets were generated from BSTs trained by \u201cgentle boosting\u201d and \u201creal boosting.\u201d Moreover, we clearly observed that the less complex the rules were, the better their fidelity was.

However, the characteristics of spatial data, especially spatial autocorrelation, are widely ignored. We hypothesize that this is problematic and results in models that can reproduce training data but are unable to make spatial predictions beyond the locations of the training samples. We assume that not only spatial validation strategies but also spatial variable selection is essential for reliable spatial predictions. We introduce two case studies that use remote sensing to predict land cover and the leaf area index for the \u201cMarburg Open Forest\u201d, an open research and education site of Marburg University, Germany. We use the machine learning algorithm Random Forests to train models using non-spatial and spatial cross-validation strategies to understand how spatial variable selection affects the predictions. Our findings confirm that spatial cross-validation is essential in preventing overoptimistic model performance. We further show that highly autocorrelated predictors (such as geolocation variables, e.g. latitude, longitude) can lead to considerable overfitting and result in models that can reproduce the training data but fail in making spatial predictions. The problem becomes apparent in the visual assessment of the spatial predictions that show clear artefacts that can be traced back to a misinterpretation of the spatially autocorrelated predictors by the algorithm. Spatial variable selection could automatically detect and remove such variables that lead to overfitting, resulting in reliable spatial prediction patterns and improved statistical spatial model performance. We conclude that in addition to spatial validation, a spatial variable selection must be considered in spatial prediction models of ecological data to produce reliable results.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1908.07805", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.108815", "venue": "Ecological Modelling, 411, 2019, 108815", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2972629016,2969536064", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["54067566", "102796104", "89141", "128498576", "39861849", "206380316", "54515760", "128980068", "134381051", "29545616", "12278296", "215033858", "14491466", "55060256", "5220004", "209092086", "60246745", "129330208", "44635588", "55319497", "15331965", "4178672", "126013313", "28876690", "3578127", "121310814", "34125624", "8937634", "23176064", "196678480", "16183407", "196669679", "6165453", "205582079", "56408774", "6769214", "15775263", "29592079"], "inbound_citations": ["207906570", "210129946"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201124800"}

Here, we propose a network-based classification framework to distinguish treatment resistant schizophrenia patients from treatment responsive ones.

Recent advances of ConvNets regularization in this context are commonly due to the use of additional regularization objectives.

Unlike those related approaches, we report that an objective without a concrete goal can serve surprisingly well as a regularizer. In particular, we demonstrate Pseudo-task Regularization (PtR) which dynamically regularizes a network by simply attempting to regress image representations to a pseudo-target during fine-tuning. Through numerous experiments, the improvements on classification accuracy by PtR are shown greater or on a par to the recent state-of-the-art methods. These results also indicate a room for rethinking on the requirements for a regularizer, i.e., if specifically designed task for regularization is indeed a key ingredient.

This study introduces a new CCVA technique and validates its performance using defined clinical diagnostic criteria as a gold standard for a multisite sample of 12,542 verbal autopsies (VAs).MethodsThe Random Forest (RF) Method from machine learning (ML) was adapted to predict cause of death by training random forests to distinguish between each pair of causes, and then combining the results through a novel ranking technique. We assessed quality of the new method at the individual level using chance-corrected concordance and at the population level using cause-specific mortality fraction (CSMF) accuracy as well as linear regression. We also compared the quality of RF to PCVA for all of these metrics. We performed this analysis separately for adult, child, and neonatal VAs. We also assessed the variation in performance with and without household recall of health care experience (HCE).ResultsFor all metrics, for all settings, RF was as good as or better than PCVA, with the exception of a nonsignificantly lower CSMF accuracy for neonates with HCE information. With HCE, the chance-corrected concordance of RF was 3.4 percentage points higher for adults, 3.2 percentage points higher for children, and 1.6 percentage points higher for neonates. The CSMF accuracy was 0.097 higher for adults, 0.097 higher for children, and 0.007 lower for neonates. Without HCE, the chance-corrected concordance of RF was 8.1 percentage points higher than PCVA for adults, 10.2 percentage points higher for children, and 5.9 percentage points higher for neonates. The CSMF accuracy was higher for RF by 0.102 for adults, 0.131 for children, and 0.025 for neonates.ConclusionsWe found that our RF Method outperformed the PCVA method in terms of chance-corrected concordance and CSMF accuracy for adult and child VA with and without HCE and for neonatal VA without HCE.

To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to large-scale kernel SVMs in sublinear time w.r.t. the size of training set, which combines three well-known and efficient techniques with theoretical guarantees. First, we subsample massive samples to reduce the sample size. Then, we use the random Fourier feature mapping on the subsamples to construct explicit random feature space where we can train a linear SVM to approximate the corresponding Gaussian kernel SVM. Finally, we use parallel algorithms to make our approach more scalable. Deriving the upper bounds of kernel matrix approximation error, hypothesis error and excess risk w.r.t. the size of training set and the dimension of random feature space, we establish the theoretical foundation of our proposed approach.

Current approaches for incremental learning deal only with the image classification and object detection tasks. In this work we formally introduce the incremental learning problem for semantic segmentation. To avoid catastrophic forgetting we propose to distill the knowledge of the previous model to retain the information about previously learned classes, whilst updating the current model to learn the new ones. We developed three main methodologies of knowledge distillation working on both the output layers and the internal feature representations. Furthermore, differently from other recent frameworks, we do not store any image belonging to the previous training stages while only the last model is used to preserve high accuracy on previously learned classes.

While several tools have previously been developed to address cell line recognition, it is unclear whether available systems can perform sufficiently well in realistic and broadcoverage applications such as extracting synthetically lethal genes from the cancer literature. In this study, we revisit the cell line name recognition task, evaluating both available systems and newly introduced methods on various resources to obtain a reliable tagger not tied to any specific subdomain. In support of this task, we introduce two text collections manually annotated for cell line names: the broad-coverage corpus Gellus and CLL, a focused target domain corpus. Results: We find that the best performance is achieved using NERsuite, a machine learning system based on Conditional Random Fields, trained on the Gellus corpus and supported with a dictionary of cell line names. The system achieves an F-score of 88.46% on the test set of Gellus and 85.98% on the independently annotated CLL corpus.

To remedy the exponentially large state space, we propose to investigate a less demanding cooperation mechanism\u2014i.e., various levels of awareness\u2014instead of communication. We define awareness as the perception of other robots locations and actions. We recognize four different levels (or degrees) of awareness which imply different amounts of additional information and therefore have different impacts on the search space size (\u0398(0), \u0398(1), \u0398(N), o(N),1 where N is the number of robots in the team). There are trivial arguments in favor of avoiding binding the increase of the search space size to the number of team members. We advocate that, by studying the maximum number of neighbor robots in the application context, it is possible to tune the parameters associated with a \u0398(1) increase of the search space size and allow good learning performance. We use the cooperative multi-robot observation of multiple moving targets (CMOMMT) application to illustrate our method. We verify that awareness allows cooperation, that cooperation shows better performance than a purely collective behavior and that learned cooperation shows better results than learned collective behavior.", "year": 2000, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1023/A:1008945119734", "venue": null, "journal": "Autonomous Robots", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1537215075", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["378655", "146425277", "5847773", "42435867", "110603852", "2014371", "3248358", "42627337", "42989757", "18460391", "37707508", "14988400", "11665951", "59809750"], "inbound_citations": ["2781399", "11682993", "28911771", "14844377", "206794869", "15160046", "18653621", "57189153", "17136625", "15705147", "5766675", "403512", "10351582", "30623745", "5943662", "8767649", "13462653", "11370718", "14609301"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14318097"}

The dimension of data sets is reduced by the analysis of the data manifold,and optimal results of data dimension reduction can be gotten. The training and test sets are gotten by the principle of ten cross validation,and data classifier can be gotten by the support vector machine. Finally,the test sets are inputted,and the face data classification can be achieved. The two classes of data sets are selected as the experimental data,which consist of ORL and Yale.

In fact, there is little consensus about what is the best procedure to identify a person with LD. Instead, the procedures are based on empirical findings from scholarly research. This is both true in the United States and Taiwan. However, the situation may be even more difficult in Taiwan. Firstly, the procedure requires a lot of manpower and resources, which is not allowable in Taiwan's current special education system. Secondly, due to the lack of nationally agreed standard, the variations of identifying procedure and the corresponding outcomes among counties are rather significant. In fact, in most counties of Taiwan, the numbers of identified LD students are heavily underestimated. The direct consequence of it is that a lot of potential LD students are not included in special education they are entitled to. To guarantee every potential LD students the right they deserved, the above two issues have to be resolved. In this paper, we try to adopt two well-known artificial intelligence techniques (Artificial Neural Network and Support Vector Machine), which have been applied successfully to solve problems in numerous fields, to the LD identification and diagnosis problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in this field. If proved workable, computer-based artificial intelligence methods will not just relieve the above two problems, but have an additional advantage in eliminating possible human bias.

This is esp. important for active sensing tasks like tactile material classification. Achieving high classification accuracy from only few samples is typically possible only when pre-knowledge is used. In n-shot transfer learning, knowledge from pre-training on a large knowledge set with many classes and samples per class has to be transferred to support the training for a given task set with only few samples per new class. In this paper, we show for the first time that deep end-to-end transfer learning is feasible for tactile material classification. Based on the previously presented (TactNet-II) [1], a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) which reaches superhuman tactile classification performance, we adapt state-of-the art deep transfer learning methods. We evaluate the resulting deep n-shot learning methods with a publicly available tactile material data set with 36 materials [1] in a 6-way n-shot learning task with 30 materials in the knowledge set. In 1-shot learning, our deep transfer learning method reaches 75.5% classification accuracy and in 10-shot more than 90%, outperforming classification without knowledge transfer by more than 40%.

With the conventional approaches for extracting this dependency structure, it is assumed that the complete sentence is known before the analysis starts. For spontaneous speech data, however, this assumption is not necessarily correct since sentence boundaries are not marked in the data. Although sentence boundaries can be detected before dependency analysis, this cascaded implementation is not suitable for online processing since it delays the responses of the application. To solve these problems, we proposed a sequential dependency analysis (SDA) method for online spontaneous speech processing, which enabled us to analyze incomplete sentences sequentially and detect sentence boundaries simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an improved SDA integrating a labeling-based sentence boundary detection (SntBD) technique based on Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). In the new method, we use CRF for soft decision of sentence boundaries and combine it with SDA to retain its online framework. Since CRF-based SntBD yields better estimates of sentence boundaries, SDA can provide better results in which the dependency structure and sentence boundaries are consistent.

Our strategy rests on the assumption that combining estimates of both AGB and carbon fluxes results in a more accurate accounting for biomass than considering only one of the terms since the cumulative carbon flux should be consistent with AGB increments. We estimated forest AGB dynamics by combining two types of models driven by field, remote sensing, and auxiliary data. The strategy was successfully applied to the Qilian Mountains, a cold arid region located in northwest China. In the first step, we improved the efficiency of existing non-parametric methods for estimating forest AGB. We applied the Random Forest (RF) model in order to pre-select the most relevant remotely sensed features in Landsat Thematic Mapper 5 (TM) and ASTER GDEM V2 products (GDEM). These features were further used to construct an optimal configuration for the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN). Validation using forest measurements from 159 plots and the leave-one-out (LOO) method indicated that the optimal k-NN configuration yielded satisfactory performance (R2 = 0.70 and RMSE = 24.52 tones ha\u22121). Hence, the k-NN configuration was used to generate a regional forest AGB basis map for 2009. In the second step, we obtained one seasonal cycles (2011) of carbon fluxes using the MODIS MOD_17 GPP (MOD_17) model that was driven by meteorological fields of a numerical weather prediction model (WRF) and calibrated to Eddy Covariance (EC) flux tower data. The calibrated model for 2010_well predicted GPP for 2011 (R2 = 0.88 and RMSE = 5.02 gC m\u22122 8d\u22121). In the third step, we calibrated the ecological process model (Biome-BioGeochemical Cycles (Biome-BGC)) to above GPP estimates (for 2011) for 30 representative forest plots over an ecological gradient in order to simulate AGB changes over time. The Biome-BGC outputs of GPP and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were validated against EC data (R2 = 0.75 and RMSE = 1. 27 gC m\u22122 d\u22121 for GPP, and R2 = 0.61 and RMSE = 1.17 gC m\u22122 d\u22121 for NEE). We used Biome-BGC to produce a longer time series for net primary productivity (NPP), which, after conversion into AGB increments, were compared to dendrochronological measurements (R2 = 0.73 and RMSE = 46.65 g m\u22122 year\u22121). The calibrated Biome-BGC model provided estimates of forest carbon fluxes that were converted into interannual AGB increments according to site-calibrated coefficients.

Disordered moonlighting regions (DMRs) are intrinsically disordered regions that carry out multiple functions. DMRs are different from moonlighting proteins that could be structured and that are annotated at the whole-protein level. DMRs cannot be identified by current predictors of functions of disorder that focus on specific functions rather than multifunctional regions. We conceptualized, designed and empirically assessed first-of-its-kind sequence-based predictor of DMRs, DMRpred. This computational tool outputs propensity for being in a DMR for each residue in an input protein sequence. We developed novel amino acid indices that quantify propensities for functions relevant to DMRs and used evolutionary conservation, putative solvent accessibility and intrinsic disorder derived from the input sequence to build a rich profile that is suitable to accurately predict DMRs. We processed this profile to derive innovative features that we input into a Random Forest model to generate the predictions. Empirical assessment shows that DMRpred generates accurate predictions with area under receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.86 and accuracy = 82%. These results are significantly better than the closest alternative approaches that rely on sequence alignment, evolutionary conservation and putative disorder and disorder functions.

While there today exists many machine learning schemes for building automatic classifiers, these are typically resource demanding and do not always achieve the best results when given the whole contents of the documents. A popular solution to these problems is called feature selection. The features (e.g. terms) in a document collection are given weights based on a simple scheme, and then ranked by these weights. Next, each document is represented using only the top ranked features, typically only a few percent of the features. The classifier is then built in considerably less time, and might even improve accuracy. In situations where the documents can belong to one of a series of categories, one can either build a multi-class classifier and use one feature set for all categories, or one can split the problem into a series of binary categorization tasks (deciding if documents belong to a category or not) and create one ranked feature subset for each category/classifier. Many feature selection metrics have been suggested over the last decades, including supervised methods that make use of a manually pre-categorized set of training documents, and unsupervised methods that need only training documents of the same type or collection that is to be categorized. While many of these look promising, there has been a lack of large-scale comparison experiments. Also, several methods have been proposed the last two years. Moreover, most evaluations are conducted on a set of binary tasks instead of a multi-class task as this often gives better results, although multi-class categorization with a joint feature set often is used in operational environments. In this report, we present results from the comparison of 16 feature selection methods (in addition to random selection) using various feature set sizes. Of these, 5 were unsupervised , and 11 were supervised. All methods are tested on both a Naive Bayes (NB) classifier and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. We conducted multi-class experiments using a collection with 20 non-overlapping categories, and each feature selection method produced feature sets common for all the categories. We also combined feature selection methods and evaluated their joint efforts. We found that the classical supervised methods had the best performance, including Chi Square, Information Gain and Mutual Information. The Chi Square variant GSS coefficient was also among the top performers. Odds Ratio showed excellent performance for NB, but not for SVM. The three unsupervised methods Collection Frequency, Collection Frequency Inverse Document Frequency and Term Frequency Document Frequency all showed performances close to the best group. The Bi-Normal Separation metric produced excellent results for the smallest feature subsets. The weirdness factor performed several times better than random selection, but was not among the top performing group.

In this paper, we study statistical aspects of the question of fitting a manifold with a nearly optimal least squared error. Given upper bounds on the dimension, volume, and curvature, we show that Empirical Risk Minimization can produce a nearly optimal manifold using a number of random samples that is independent of the ambient dimension of the space in which data lie. We obtain an upper bound on the required number of samples that depends polynomially on the curvature, exponentially on the intrinsic dimension, and linearly on the intrinsic volume. For constant error, we prove a matching minimax lower bound on the sample complexity that shows that this dependence on intrinsic dimension, volume and curvature is unavoidable. Whether the known lower bound of O(k/e2 + log 1/\u03b4/e2) for the sample complexity of Empirical Risk minimization on k-means applied to data in a unit ball of arbitrary dimension is tight, has been an open question since 1997 [3]. Here e is the desired bound on the error and \u03b4 is a bound on the probability of failure. We improve the best currently known upper bound [14] of O(k2/e2 + log 1/\u03b4/e2) to O(k/e2 (min (k, + log4 k/e/e2)) + log 1/\u03b4/e2).

These solutions are well accepted by users and cheap as no additional sensor is required for authenticating the user before accessing to an application. In the last thirty years, many researchers have proposed, different algorithms aimed at increasing the performance of this approach. Their main drawback lies on the large number of data required for the enrollment step. As a consequence, the verification system is barely usable, because the enrollment is too restrictive. In this work, we propose a new method based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning satisfying industrial conditions (i.e., few samples per user are needed during the enrollment phase to create its template). In this method, users are authenticated through the keystroke dynamics of a shared secret (chosen by the system administrator). We use the GREYC keystroke database that is composed of a large number of users (100) for validation purposes. We compared the proposed method with six methods from the literature (selected based on their ability to work with few enrollment samples). Experimental results show that, even though the computation time to build the template can be longer with our method (54 s against 3 s for most of the others), its performance outperforms the other methods in an industrial context (Equal Error Rate of 15.28% against 16.79% and 17.02% for the two best methods of the state-of-the-art, on our dataset and five samples to create the template, with a better computation time than the second best method).", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cose.2011.03.004", "venue": "Comput.

A key advantage of these bounds is that they are designed for specific learning algorithms, exploiting their particular properties. But, as in much of learning theory, existing stability analyses and bounds apply only in the scenario where the samples are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.). In many machine learning applications, however, this assumption does not hold. The observations received by the learning algorithm often have some inherent temporal dependence, which is clear in system diagnosis or time series prediction problems. This paper studies the scenario where the observations are drawn from a stationary mixing sequence, which implies a dependence between observations that weaken over time. It proves novel stability-based generalization bounds that hold even with this more general setting. These bounds strictly generalize the bounds given in the i.i.d. case. It also illustrates their application in the case of several general classes of learning algorithms, including Support Vector Regression and Kernel Ridge Regression.", "year": 1025, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 20", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2129247014", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7600536", "1157797", "16814791", "118878494", "53246581", "11349656", "772275", "58731659", "11673795", "5398743", "7099687", "28637672", "60711349"], "inbound_citations": ["4557952", "878133", "15594658", "9335984", "13290263", "14510563", "214714137", "1621435"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1735612"}

The Hamming-Graph Learning Algorithm (HGLA) is proposed in this paper. The n-dimension Hamming-Graph HG=V,E is an n-order regular graph to express n-dimension Hamming geometric space. The node-set V has 2 n nodes, and the Hamming distance between the two nodes connected by one side is equal to constant 1. If a core node V c in a HG is selected, and let its next adjacent nodes as its children, and so on, then, we get a directed HG. The sub-graph consisting of the core (and the root) node V c, and all of its true children is called the first level Sub-Hamming-Graph of HG, the SHG1. The vertices inside a SHG1 of the n-dimension HG can surely be separated from the vertices outside SHG1 by a hyperplane. Thus, it can be expressed using one hidden neuron. And if it can be expanded as large as possible, then, the structure of binary neural network can be best optimized. But, whether one SHGL can be separated from the vertices outside by a hyperplane when L1 is not sure. Without some conditions to select the core node and to expand the SHG1, the learning algorithm of BNN will still be exhaustive. Therefore, a true node that has the most true-nodes adjacent should be selected as the core node V c. And if there are more than one such node, the one within them that has the most adjacent nodes each other should be selected. Only the true nodes all of whose parents have been within the SHGL could be expanded, and every step of the expansion should be tested using the criterion min{H y|V y\u2208SHGL}max{H z|V z\u2208\uff5eSHGL} (formula 5). If SHGL is formed and mostly expanded according to these conditions, and if it is linear separable, it must be the biggest true nodes set in the SHGL that can be linear separated from the others. Being not exhaustive, HGLA is a fast learning algorithm. Two examples in the references are tested and compared using HGLA and ETL. For example A(A 7-Bit Binary Function), HGLA requires only 3 hidden neurons but ETL requires 7; For example B(Approximation of a Circular Region), HGLA demands only 4 hidden neurons, but ETL requires 5; and the output neuron of HGLA needs not be trained, so it is optimized.", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Chinese Journal of Computers", "mag_id": "2356419895", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:124058794"}

We propose a novel definition of precision and recall for distributions which disentangles the divergence into two separate dimensions. The proposed notion is intuitive, retains desirable properties, and naturally leads to an efficient algorithm that can be used to evaluate generative models. We relate this notion to total variation as well as to recent evaluation metrics such as Inception Score and FID.

For this purpose, a total of 212 landslides for the study area were identified and collected. Of these landslides, 70% (148) were selected randomly for building the models and the other landslides (64) were used for validating the models. Accordingly, 12 landslide conditioning factors were considered that involve altitude, slope angle, plan curvature, profile curvature, slope aspect, distance to roads, distance to faults, distance to rivers, rainfall, NDVI, land use, and lithology. Then, the spatial correlation between conditioning factors and landslides was analysed using the RF method to quantify the predictive ability of these factors.

The aim of this work is to develop and evaluate a methodological framework dedicated to building a prognostic model based on heterogeneity textural features of multimodal MRI sequences (T1, T1-contrast, T2 and FLAIR) in GBM. The proposed workflow consists in i) registering the available 3D multimodal MR images and segmenting the tumor volume, ii) extracting image features such as heterogeneity metrics and iii) building a prognostic model by selecting, ranking and combining optimal features through machine learning (Support Vector Machine). This framework was applied to 40 histologically proven GBM patients with the endpoint being overall survival (OS) classified as above or below the median survival (15 months). The models combining features from a maximum of two modalities were evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). A classification accuracy of 90% (sensitivity 85%, specificity 95%) was obtained by combining features from T1 pre-contrast and T1 post-contrast sequences. Our results suggest that several textural features in each MR sequence have prognostic value in GBM.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.irbm.2015.08.001", "venue": "IRBM", "journal": "IRBM", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1745724051", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["205269411", "85899164", "9927409", "21869860", "42765149", "20494576", "8078831", "29397499", "17648865", "15329957", "61649919", "2605077", "16196184", "16810534", "3463023", "4709680", "8477812"], "inbound_citations": ["5116665", "24071064", "34697324", "3272310", "206937497", "42275353", "207824757", "21519955"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:35009277"}

The proposed training of a high-resolution VAE model begins with the training of a low-resolution core model, which can be successfully trained on imbalanced data set. In subsequent training steps, new convolutional, upsampling, deconvolutional, and downsampling layers are iteratively attached to the model. In each iteration, the additional layers are trained based on the intermediate pretrained model - a result of previous training iterations. Thus, the resolution of the model is progressively increased up to the required resolution level. In this paper, the progressive VAE training is exploited for learning a latent representation with imbalanced, highly sparse data sets and, consequently, generating routes in a constrained 2D space. Routing problems (e.g., vehicle routing problem, travelling salesman problem, and arc routing) are of special significance in many modern applications (e.g., route planning, network maintenance, developing high-performance nanoelectronic systems, and others) and typically associated with sparse imbalanced data. In this paper, the critical problem of routing billions of components in nanoelectronic devices is considered. The proposed approach exhibits a significant training speedup as compared with state-of-the-art existing VAE training methods, while generating expected image outputs from unseen input data. Furthermore, the final progressive VAE models exhibit much more precise output representation, than the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models trained with comparable training time. The proposed method is expected to be applicable to a wide range of applications, including but not limited image impainting, sentence interpolation, and semi-supervised learning.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1912.08283", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2995983919", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["7179166", "15303511", "1277929", "3345417", "118826561", "88514428", "5216145", "6200260", "116084071", "195908774", "211227", "205514", "17485266", "9302801", "11235176", "10305401", "7365802", "5334482"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209405120"}

In two experiments we identified the stimulation threshold at which the brain changes to an afterdischarge state. In one experiment a range of suprathreshold stimulations were applied, and in another the stimulation was not changed. The neural state was measured by the power spectral density prior to stimulation. In the first experiment, these measures and the stimulation parameters were used as features, either together or separately, for training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict whether the stimulation would produce an afterdischarge. In the second experiment, recursive feature elimination was used to iteratively remove the neural state features from the recording channels that had the least impact on the overall accuracy. In the first experiment 43 stimulations elicited 26 afterdischarges. In predicting the post-stimulation state-change (afterdischarge vs. no afterdischarge) the feature space of only neural state had a higher accuracy (67.4%) than when combined with the stimulation parameters (65.1%) or the stimulation parameters alone (58.1%). The overall classification results from both feature spaces containing the neural state were non-independent (chi-squared p <; 0.01). In the second experiment, the channels that were the least predictive were those on the more distal ends of the recording electrode, and the most predictive were clustered in the center of the electrode. Additionally, the accuracy increased when 4 channels were removed.
