It can perform well in nonlinear cases. Moreover, the kernel parameters of EMMC need not be tuned by means of random feature mappings. Experimental results on several real-world data sets show that EMMC performs better than traditional MMC methods, especially in handling large scale data sets. Streszczenie.

It is a challenging task not only because of the variations produced by general factors like illumination, background clutter, occlusion or intra-class variation, but also because of subtle behavioral patterns among interacting people or between people and objects in images as well as attracts many attentions in activity in recently years. However, these researches are not yet fully realized due to the lack of an effective feature to present human action. In this paper, we present a novel for human action representation based on hybrid features from local and global features. Firstly, a local-based feature descriptor is combined by motion and SURF. Secondly, improved BOW with kmeans++ and soft-weighting scheme are used to yield the histogram of word occurrences (HoWO) to present for action in video. Thirdly, HOG/HOF features are extracted from video for global features. Next, hybrid features is created by concatenating HoWO and HOG/HOF. Lastly, Support Vector Machine is used for classification on KTH, Weizmann and YouTube datasets. The experimental results also indicated that the extraction of features is effective and shows the feasibility of our proposal.

In such attacks, the impostor impersonates a legitimate insider while performing illegitimate activities. These attacks are very hard to detect and can cause considerable damage to an organization. Prior work has focused on user command modeling to identify abnormal behavior indicative of impersonation. In this paper, we investigate the performance of two one-class user behavior profiling techniques: one-class Support Vector Machines (ocSVMs) and a Hellinger distance-based user behavior profiling technique. Both techniques model bags of words or commands and do not model sequences of commands . We use both techniques for masquerade detection and compare the experimental results. The objective is to evaluate which modeling technique is most suitable for use in an operational monitoring system, hence our focus is on accuracy and operational performance characteristics. We show that one-class SVMs are most practical for deployment in sensors developed for masquerade detection in the general case. We also show that for specific users whose profile fits the average user profile, one-class SVMs may not be the best modeling approach.

Though password-based authentication system is simple, it is highly vulnerable to security breaches. Biometric based authentication has better security, but usage of single biometric traits can also be easily compromised. Thus, this research work, Multimodal Biometric Hashkey Cryptography (MBHC) brings about a novel security framework that focuses on both authentication and securing cloud data using multiple modalities. Authentication is based on multiple biometric modalities viz. Fingerprint, Iris and Face features. Features from these modalities are extracted using linear filters. Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA) is used for feature optimization, further to which Support Vector Machine (SVM) acts as classifier for identifying genuine users against imposters. Cryptographic keys are generated from these modalities that serve as input to Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Algorithm for encrypting and decrypting the information stored in cloud. Integrity of data is also ensured using hash function for which the facial features and the encrypted message are the inputs.

A promising approach to identify biomarkers is using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which can be used to analyze graph structured data, i.e. brain networks constructed by fMRI. One way to interpret important features is through looking at how the classification probability changes if the features are occluded or replaced. The major limitation of this approach is that replacing values may change the distribution of the data and lead to serious errors. Therefore, we develop a 2-stage pipeline to eliminate the need to replace features for reliable biomarker interpretation. Specifically, we propose an inductive GNN to embed the graphs containing different properties of task-fMRI for identifying ASD and then discover the brain regions/sub-graphs used as evidence for the GNN classifier. We first show GNN can achieve high accuracy in identifying ASD. Next, we calculate the feature importance scores using GNN and compare the interpretation ability with Random Forest. Finally, we run with different atlases and parameters, proving the robustness of the proposed method.

On the other side of the spectrum stands the local modelling approach, in which the input space is segmented into several small partitions and a specialized regression model is fit to each partition. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called Regional Models (RM), that stands in between the global and local modelling ones. The proposal extends the two-level clustering approach by Vesanto and Alhoniemi (2000 [1] ) to regression problems, more specifically, to system identification. In this regard, we first partition the input space using the Self-Organizing Map (SOM), and then perform clustering over the prototypes of the trained SOM. Finally, regional regression models are built over the clusters (i.e. over the regions) of SOM prototypes, not over each SOM prototype as in local modelling. Under the proposed framework, we build regional linear and nonlinear regression models. For the linear case, we use autoregressive models with eXogenous (ARX) whose parameters are estimated using the ordinary least-squares (OLS) method.

They enjoy strong theoretical foundations and excellent empirical successes in many pattern-recognition applications. However, when kernel methods are applied to many emerging large-scale applications, such as video surveillance, multimedia information retrieval, and web mining, they suffer from the challenges of ineffective and inefficient training. In this dissertation, we explore these challenges and propose strategies to solve them. ::: We first investigate the imbalanced-training challenge which causes the training of kernel methods to be ineffective. The imbalance-training problem occurs when the training instances of the target class are significantly outnumbered by the other training instances. In such situations, we show the class boundary trained from SVMs can be severely skewed toward the target class. We propose using conformal transformation on the kernel function in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space for tackling the challenge. ::: The training performance of kernel methods greatly depends on the chosen kernel function or matrix. A kernel function or matrix defines a pairwise-similarity measurement between two data instances. We thus develop an algorithm to formulate a context-dependent distance function for measuring such similarity. We demonstrate that the learned distance function leads to improved performance for kernel-based clustering and classification tasks. Moreover, we also research the situations where the similarity measurement to formulate the kernel function might not induce a positive semi-definite (psd) kernel matrix, and hence cannot be used for training with kernel methods. We propose an analytical framework on evaluating several representative spectrum-transformation methods. ::: Finally, we address the efficiency of kernel methods to achieve fast training on massive data. Especially, we focus on Support Vector Machines. The traditional solutions of SVMs suffer from the widely-known scalability problem. We propose an incremental algorithm, which performs approximate matrix-factorization operations, to speed up SVMs. Two approximate factorization schemes, Kronecker and incomplete Cholesky, are utilized in the primal-dual interior-point method (IPM) to directly solve the quadratic optimization problem in SVMs. ::: Through theoretical analysis and extensive empirical studies, we show that our proposed approaches are able to perform more effectively, and efficiently, than traditional methods.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2246823984", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:124921534"}

Nevertheless, we are still far from achieving high-performance ASR systems. Some alternative approaches, most of them based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), were proposed during the late eighties and early nineties. Some of them tackled the ASR problem using predictive ANNs, while others proposed hybrid HMM/ANN systems. However, despite some achievements, nowadays, the preponderance of Markov Models is a fact. ::: ::: During the last decade, however, a new tool appeared in the field of machine learning that has proved to be able to cope with hard classification problems in several fields of application: the Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The SVMs are effective discriminative classifiers with several outstanding characteristics, namely: their solution is that with maximum margin; they are capable to deal with samples of a very higher dimensionality; and their convergence to the minimum of the associated cost function is guaranteed. ::: ::: These characteristics have made SVMs very popular and successful. In this chapter we discuss their strengths and weakness in the ASR context and make a review of the current state-of-the-art techniques. We organize the contributions in two parts: isolated-word recognition and continuous speech recognition. Within the first part we review several techniques to produce the fixed-dimension vectors needed for original SVMs. Afterwards we explore more sophisticated techniques based on the use of kernels capable to deal with sequences of different length. Among them is the DTAK kernel, simple and effective, which rescues an old technique of speech recognition: Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Within the second part, we describe some recent approaches to tackle more complex tasks like connected digit recognition or continuous speech recognition using SVMs. Finally we draw some conclusions and outline several ongoing lines of research.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-540-71505-4_11", "venue": "WNSP", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2166259874,2179065241", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["61946039", "57863167", "61058350", "28637672", "7138354", "9563026", "61818881", "18454590", "8911025", "62750399", "207165665", "175960", "123487779", "27161171", "206737865", "2376038", "17654220", "14561315", "5846219", "6222505", "2268588", "17987294", "60569996", "7634598", "16194565", "13321569", "122962127", "5847709", "14336127", "17441744", "60565534", "7835262", "8128330", "11082657", "6041937", "8200042", "961425", "7664224", "52810328", "5667586", "2836122"], "inbound_citations": ["17163890", "18809508", "19731709", "207997324", "8291625", "14310158", "28399097", "5796061", "53737276", "6279899", "11860887", "17345455", "15688723", "42286402", "17930656", "15465598", "15047707", "15686010", "9828665"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17351726"}

The weights are typically obtained by applying a distance-based kernel function to each of the samples, which presumes the existence of a well-defined distance metric. In this paper, we construct a novel algorithm for supervised metric learning, which learns a distance function by directly minimizing the leave-one-out regression error. We show that our algorithm makes kernel regression comparable with the state of the art on several benchmark datasets, and we provide efficient implementation details enabling application to datasets with \u223cO(10k) instances.

Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a software tool used to detect unauthorized access to a computer system or network. It is a dynamic monitoring entity that complements the static monitoring abilities of a firewall. Data Mining techniques provide efficient methods for the development of IDS. The idea behind using data mining techniques is that they can automate the process of creating traffic models from some reference data and thereby eliminate the need of laborious manual intervention. Such systems are capable of detecting not only known attacks but also their variations.Existing IDS technologies, on the basis of detection methodology are broadly classified as Misuse or Signature Based Detection and Anomaly Detection Based System. The idea behind misuse detection consists of comparing network traffic against a Model describing known intrusion. The anomaly detection method is based on the analysis of the profiles that represent normal traffic behavior. Semi-Supervised systems for anomaly detection would reduce the demands of the training process by reducing the requirement of training labeled data. A Self Training Support Vector Machine based detection algorithm is presented in this thesis. In the past, Self-Training of SVM has been successfully used for reducing the size of labeled training set in other domains. A similar method was implemented and results of the simulation performed on the KDD Cup 99 dataset for intrusion detection show a reduction of upto 90% in the size of labeled training set required as compared to the supervised learning techniques.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "59233249", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["382325", "14311498", "14516773", "3235414", "9874918", "8214016", "13861754", "961425"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:33193461"}

Rule-based models can be easily read and interpreted by humans, that makes them particularly useful in survival studies as they can help clinicians to better understand analysed data and make informed decisions about patient treatment. Although of such usefulness, there is still a little research on rule learning in survival analysis. In this paper we take a step towards rule-based analysis of survival data. Methods: We investigate so-called covering or separate-and-conquer method of rule induction in combination with a weighting scheme for handling censored observations. We also focus on rule quality measures being one of the key elements differentiating particular implementations of separate-and-conquer rule induction algorithms. We examine 15 rule quality measures guiding rule induction process and reflecting a wide range of different rule learning heuristics. Results: The algorithm is extensively tested on a collection of 20 real survival datasets and compared with the state-of-the-art survival trees and random survival forests algorithms. Most of the rule quality measures outperform Kaplan-Meier estimate and perform at least equally well as tree-based algorithms.

Extreme Support Vector Machine (ESVM), combining Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) kernels, can lead to a better prediction capability. ESVM can usually have a relatively good predictive capability, and its training time is shorter than SVM most of the time. However, the estimation of regularization parameter of ESVM is very time-consuming. Moreover, the effects of the variance of hidden layer weights and the number of hidden neurons on ESVM are still unclear. Generalized Cross-Validation (GCV) has been widely used in statistics because it can efficiently estimate the ridge parameter without estimating the variance of errors. In this work, we study a connection between ESVM and GCV. Specifically, we consider the computation of the separating plane in ESVM as a ridge regression problem, and propose to use GCV to estimate the regularization parameter of ESVM. Experimental results show that GCV can significantly improve the efficiency of ESVM without accuracy lost. Also, the regularization parameter estimated by GCV can help to analyze how the variance of hidden layer weights and the number of hidden neurons affect the performance of ESVM.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280322", "venue": "2015 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)", "journal": "2015 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1612686017", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["18820084", "1596997", "12755946", "207101649", "15883898", "123593617", "125592030", "121589596", "53222218", "121758775", "118654065", "121333337", "41147168"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12426350"}

To propose that our approaches (with Matthews Correlation Coefficients from 0.40 to 0.87 on truly external test sets, when extrapolation beyond the applicability domain was not evident and sufficient quantities of data were available for training) are competitive with those currently proposed in the literature. 2. To highlight key issues associated with building and assessing truly predictive models, in particular the considerable variation in model performance when training and testing on different datasets.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "27467090", "doi": "10.1002/minf.201000159", "venue": "Molecular informatics", "journal": "Molecular informatics", "mag_id": "1979970332", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["2811065", "3849730", "16356154", "26128098", "106408216", "21671945", "215256260", "94378370", "195764275", "12383302", "170078678", "7087537", "5042413"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21239072"}

This study proposed a predictor called enDNA-Prot for DNA-binding protein identification by employing the ensemble learning technique. Experiential results showed that enDNA-Prot was comparable with DNA-Prot and outperformed DNAbinder and iDNA-Prot with performance improvement in the range of 3.97-9.52% in ACC and 0.08-0.19 in MCC. Furthermore, when the benchmark dataset was expanded with negative samples, the performance of enDNA-Prot outperformed the three existing methods by 2.83-16.63% in terms of ACC and 0.02-0.16 in terms of MCC.

Ultrasound has therefore become essential in the detection of emboli when monitoring cerebral vascular disorders and forms part of ultrasound brain-imaging techniques. Such detection is based on investigating the middle cerebral artery using a TransCranial Doppler (TCD) system, and analyzing the Doppler signal of the embolism. Most of the emboli detected in practical experiments are large emboli because their signatures are easy to recognize in the TCD signal. However, detection of small emboli remains a challenge. Various approaches have been proposed to solve the problem, ranging from the exclusive use of expert human knowledge to automated collection of signal parameters. Many studies have recently been performed using time-frequency distributions and classical parameter modeling for automatic detection of emboli. It has been shown that autoregressive (AR) modeling associated with an abrupt change detection technique is one of the best methods for detection of microemboli. One alternative to this is a technique based on taking expert knowledge into account. This paper aims to unite these two approaches using AR modeling and expert knowledge through a neurofuzzy approach. The originality of this approach lies in combining these two techniques and then proposing a parameter referred to as score ranging from 0 to 1. Unlike classical techniques, this score is not only a measure of confidence of detection but also a tool enabling the final detection of the presence or absence of microemboli to be performed by the practitioner.

In order to achieve efficient collaboration between the human and robot, it requires not only the robot to understand what the human is doing, but also the robot's behavior be understood by (a.k.a. explainable to) the human. While most prior work has focused on the first aspect, the latter has also begun to draw significant attention. We propose an approach to explaining robot behavior as intention signaling using natural language sentences. In contrast to recent approaches to generating explicable and legible plans, intention signaling does not require the robot to deviate from its optimal plan; neither does it require humans to update their knowledge as generally required for explanation generation. The key questions to be answered here for intention signaling are the what (content of signaling) and when (timing). Based on our prior work, we formulate human interpreting robot actions as a labeling process to be learned. To capture the dependencies between the interpretation of robot actions that are far apart, skip-chain Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are used. The answers to the when and what can then be converted to an inference problem in the skip-chain CRFs. Potential timings and content of signaling are explored by fixing the labels of certain actions in the CRF model; the configuration that maximizes the underlying probability of being able to associate a label with the remaining actions, which reflects the human's understanding of the robot's plan, is returned for signaling. For evaluation, we construct a synthetic domain to verify that intention signaling can help achieve better teaming by reducing criticism on robot behavior that may appear undesirable but is otherwise required, e.g., due to information asymmetry that results in misinterpretation.

How to make the decision more intelligent in latency time becomes a crucial requirement for many researches. In this paper, a double-layered architecture ATWDP of online and offline analytics for solar cells series welding machine industry is proposed and the distributed and parallel computing system can handle the above challenges.

The electricity is a special energy which is hard to store, so its supply must be consistent with the demand. The objective of electricity demand forecasting is to make best use of electricity energy and provide balance between supply and demand. Hence, it is very important work to forecast electricity demand with higher precision. So, various forecasting methods have been developed. They can be divided into five broad categories such as time series models, regression based model, artificial intelligence techniques and fuzzy logic method without considering special-day effects. Electricity demand patterns on holidays can be often idiosyncratic and cause significant forecasting errors. Such effects are known as special-day effects and are recognized as an important issue in determining electricity demand data. In this research, we developed the power demand forecasting method using ELM(Extreme Learning Machine) for special day, particularly, lunar new year and Chuseok holiday.Key Words : ELM, Forecasting model, Power demand, Special-day *Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Korea National University of Transportation, Korea\u2020Corresponding Author : Dept. of Electrical Engineering Daeduk College, Korea E-mail : jylim@ddc.ac.kr\uc811\uc218\uc77c\uc790 : 2015\ub144 5\uc6d4 3\uc77c\ucd5c\uc885\uc644\ub8cc : 2015\ub144 5\uc6d4 20\uc77c", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5370/KIEEP.2015.64.2.074", "venue": null, "journal": "The Transactions of the Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers", "mag_id": "2330417383", "mag_field_of_study": ["Economics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:155745848"}

A large body of WiFi-based IPSs adopt fingerprinting approaches for localization. However, these IPSs suffer from two major problems: the intensive costs of manpower and time for offline site survey and the inflexibility to environmental dynamics. In this paper, we propose an indoor localization algorithm based on an online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) to address the above problems accordingly. The fast learning speed of OS-ELM can reduce the time and manpower costs for the offline site survey. Meanwhile, its online sequential learning ability enables the proposed localization algorithm to adapt in a timely manner to environmental dynamics. Experiments under specific environmental changes, such as variations of occupancy distribution and events of opening or closing of doors, are conducted to evaluate the performance of OS-ELM.

It is even more difficult for ancient and calligraphic writings, as in Arabic manuscripts, due to the cursive connection in Arabic text, the erroneous position of diacritic marks, the presence of ascending and descending letters, etc. In this work, we propose an effective segmentation of Arabic handwritten text into text-lines and words, using deep learning. For text-line segmentation, we used an RU-net which allows a pixel-wise classification to separate text-lines pixels from the background ones. For word segmentation, we resorted to the text-line transcription, as we have not got a ground truth at word level. A BLSTM-CTC (Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory followed by a Connectionist Temporal Classification) is then used to perform the mapping between the transcription and text-line image, avoiding the need of the input segmentation. A CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) precedes the BLST-CTC to extract the features and to feed the BLSTM with the essential of the text-line image.

By applying this method to train classifiers on various combinations of feature types, we were able to complete each training process within 3,500 seconds and achieve higher than 99.6% test accuracy in classifying a textual component into Chinese, alphanumeric, and punctuation.

Thus, knowledge of spatial patterns of fire danger of the district plays a key role in forest succession and ecological implications. This study's aim was to analyze the spatial pattern of fire danger for the tropical forest of Thuan Chau district using advanced machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Machine classifier (SVMC), Random Forests (RF), and Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP-Net). For this purpose, a GIS database for the study area was established with 564 forest fire locations and ten forest fire variables. Then, Pearson correlation method was used to assess the correlation of the variables with the forest fire. In the next step, three forest fire danger models, SVMC, RF, and MLP-Net, were trained and validated. Finally, global performance of these models was assessed using the classification accuracy (ACC), Kappa statistics (KS), Area under the curve (AUC). In addition, Wilcoxon signed-rank test was employed to check the prediction performance of these models. The result shows the three models performed well; however, the MLP-Net model has the highest prediction performance (ACC = 81.7, KS = 0.633, and AUC = 0.894), followed by the RF model (ACC = 81.1, KS = 0.621, and AUC = 0.883), and the SVMC model (ACC = 80.2, KS = 0.604, and AUC = 0.867).

Method Fifty-five consecutive patients with LARC were retrospectively enrolled in this study. Patients underwent 3 T Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) acquiring T2-weighted images before, during and after CRT. All patients underwent complete surgical resection and histopathology was the gold standard. Textural features were automatically extracted using an open-source software. A sub-set of statistically significant textural features was selected and two AI models were built by training a Random Forest (RF) classifier on 28 patients (training cohort). Model performances were estimated on 27 patients (validation cohort) using a ROC curve and a decision curve analysis. Results Sixteen of 55 patients achieved CR.

During the establishment of the framework, lots of data are needed. One of the main data sources are activity-based diaries.

To this end, the control of dynamic, anthropomorphic figures subject to gravity and contact forces remains a difficult open problem. We propose a framework for composing controllers in order to enhance the motor abilities of such figures. A key contribution of our composition framework is an explicit model of the \u201cpre-conditions\u201d under which motor controllers are expected to function properly. We demonstrate controller composition with pre-conditions determined not only manually, but also automatically based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning theory. We evaluate our composition framework using a family of controllers capable of synthesizing basic actions such as balance, protective stepping when balance is disturbed, protective arm reactions when falling, and multiple ways of standing up after a fall. We furthermore demonstrate these basic controllers working in conjunction with more dynamic motor skills within a prototype virtual stunt-person.

Satellite telemetry enables researchers to track individual movements, but population level inferences are rare due to data limitations that result from difficulty of capture and sporadic tag reporting. We introduce a Bayesian modeling framework to address population level questions with satellite telemetry data when data are sparse. We also outline an approach for identifying informative variables for use within the model. We tested our modeling approach using a large telemetry dataset for Shortfin Makos (Isurus oxyrinchus), which allowed us to assess the effects of various degrees of data paucity. First, a permuted Random Forest analysis is implemented to determine which variables are most informative. Next, a generalized additive mixed model is used to help define the relationship of each remaining variable with the response variable. Using jags and rjags for the analysis of Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation, we then developed a movement model to generate parameter estimates for each of the variables of interest. By randomly reducing the tagging dataset by 25, 50, 75, and 90 percent and recalculating the parameter estimates, we demonstrate that the proposed Bayesian approach can be applied in data-limited situations. We also demonstrate how two commonly used linear mixed models with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) can be similarly applied. Additionally, we simulate data from known parameter values to test each model's ability to recapture those values. Despite performing similarly, we advocate using the Bayesian over the MLE approach due to the ability for later studies to easily utilize results of past study to inform working models, and the ability to use prior knowledge via informed priors in systems where such information is available.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5705164", "pubmed_id": "29182675", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0188660", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2769257823", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["46715413", "56151380", "38378636", "43287037", "56360865", "16750990", "3827023", "88246473", "107697", "206558668", "10568212", "4399575", "111156074", "127680303", "54584244", "24546061", "38000027", "20326251", "54176344", "86435839", "44553856", "38945877", "53561224", "972174", "88513115", "85554170", "10040306", "8215424", "12099122", "7308904", "89308242", "85659783", "215016378", "215601653", "8529157", "143452177", "60143345", "117489917", "7717482", "15404916", "45143424", "84063171", "17635327", "85720169", "26586370", "86322631", "87019744", "90446877", "84730228", "83881486", "35926834", "17642563"], "inbound_citations": ["208368605", "197403176"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:25126444"}

Despite its many applications, Bayesian inference faces challenges when inferring fields that have discrete representations of large dimension, and/or have prior distributions that are difficult to represent mathematically. In this manuscript we consider the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in addressing these challenges. A GAN is a type of deep neural network equipped with the ability to learn the distribution implied by multiple samples of a given field. Once trained on these samples, the generator component of a GAN maps the iid components of a low-dimensional latent vector to an approximation of the distribution of the field of interest. In this work we demonstrate how this approximate distribution may be used as a prior in a Bayesian update, and how it addresses the challenges associated with characterizing complex prior distributions and the large dimension of the inferred field.

Accurate crude oil price forecasts often lead to a rapid new production development with higher quality and less cost. Making such accurate forecasts, however, is challenging due to the intrinsic complexity of oil market mechanism. Many techniques have been tested in the crude oil price forecasting literature. Although forecast combination is a well-known method to improve forecast accuracy, generating forecasts using various techniques tend to be labor intensive. How to efficiently generate many individual forecasts for combination becomes a research question in crude oil price forecasting. Recently, several signal decomposition methods have been suggested for processing the oil price signals. In this paper, we propose a semi-heterogeneous approach to combining crude oil price forecasts, which interacts a set of decomposition methods with a set of forecasting techniques. We first decompose the original price series using four decomposition methods, such as Wavelet Analysis, Singular Spectral Analysis, Empirical Mode Decomposition, and Variational Mode Decomposition. We then use four different forecasting techniques, such as Autoregressive Models, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Models, Artificial Neural Networks, and Support Vector Regression Models, to forecast the components from each decomposition methods. Finally, we reconstruct the price forecasts from the forecasted components. This process generates 16 price forecasts in total for combination. We test the combination based on all individual forecasts, as well as a subset of the individual forecasts selected using Tabu Search. The experimental results demonstrate that the forecasting models with the addition of a decomposition technique can have an error reduction of 30.6% compared to benchmark models on average. The combined forecasts outperform the individual forecasts on average. Furthermore, comparing with the heterogeneous combination of 4 individual forecasts, the semi-heterogeneous combinations reduce the errors by 56.6% (w/o Tabu Search) and 61.6% (w/ Tabu Search).", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ins.2018.05.026", "venue": "Inf.

The problem involved with the estimation of the local model parameters of neurofuzzy networks is the presence of noise in measured data. When some or all input channels are subject to noise, the GTLS algorithm yields consistent parameter estimates. In addition to the estimation of the parameters, the main challenge in the design of these local model networks is the determination of the region of validity for the local models. The method presented in this paper is based on an expectation-maximization algorithm that uses a residual from the GTLS parameter estimation for proper partitioning. The performance of the resulting nonlinear model with local parameters estimated by weighted GTLS is a product both of the parameter estimation itself and the associated residual used for the partitioning process. The applicability and benefits of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated by means of illustrative examples and an automotive application.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "19336320", "doi": "10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2013132", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2157959176", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["6355779", "27080032", "122032281", "27560319", "116530374", "122250362", "20766071", "42203199", "18887018", "38010222", "123094035", "45324656", "29584535", "119698877", "121275166", "52805976", "15621029", "120162309", "119575099", "60993494", "52805976", "4193919", "209842899"], "inbound_citations": ["6939655", "11424247", "4962739", "32117473", "9793503", "1881562", "8532490", "46477612", "44480929", "14621350", "206790808", "5614152", "8007831"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13373750"}

The detection of fraudulent transactions has become a significant factor affecting the greater utilization of electronic payment.

Diagnosability, a measure of the ability to correctly determine the taxon of a specimen of unknown origin, has historically been used to delimit subspecies, but few studies have explored how to estimate it from DNA sequences. Using simulated and empirical data sets, we demonstrate that Random Forests produces classification models that perform well for diagnosing subspecies and species. Populations with strong social structure and relatively low abundances (e.g., killer whales, Orcinus orca) were found to be as diagnosable as species. Conversely, comparisons involving subspecies that are abundant (e.g., spinner and spotted dolphins, Stenella longirostris and S. attenuata), are only as diagnosable as many population comparisons. Estimates of diagnosability reported in subspecies and species descriptions should include confidence intervals, which are influenced by the sample sizes of the training data. We also stress the importance of reporting the certainty with which individuals in the training data are classified in order to communicate the strength of the classification model and diagnosability estimate.

The optimizer generates an energy-optimal trajectory by efficiently using the robot kinematic redundancy while taking into account maximal joint motion, collision avoidance and local minima. To enable the resulting method to work in real-time, examples of the global planner are generalized using nearest neighbour approaches, Support Vector Machines and Gaussian process regression, which are compared in this context. Evaluations indicate that the presented method is highly efficient in complex tasks such as ball-catching.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980114", "venue": "2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation", "journal": "2011 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2095905067", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["18501552", "16530170", "17382291", "23702426", "14001737", "106634732", "108515473", "123236836", "6886868", "1430472", "11058032", "11728002", "5246200", "207165665", "15480929"], "inbound_citations": ["8947552", "46891595", "116397993", "198185587", "116514003", "12023663", "751541", "12153493", "17264180", "41854999", "15288780", "69197284", "15897361", "54017937", "11818684", "9941466", "56174076", "46958395", "12808983", "53287989", "174818628", "209090923", "212737238", "26656910", "893094", "16073449", "51980467", "6871506", "14487335", "4330709", "139681537", "1953458", "51915731", "204802572", "3740173", "6463721", "333279", "6431195", "115887180", "49865670", "17279105", "15754553", "2393365", "113404192", "9962548", "19488971", "210929348"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11522689"}

We avoid the computational pitfalls of using extensive cross validation for model selection. For example, in Support Vector Machines (SVMs) [6], both the choice of kernels and corresponding kernel parameters is based on extensive cross validation experiments, making generating good SVM models computationally very dicult. Other algorithms, such as Minimax Probability Machine Classication (MPMC) [5], Neural Networks, and even ensemble methods such as Boosting, can suer from the same computational pitfalls. The Minimax Probability Machine for Classication (MPMC), due to Lanckriet et al. [5], is a recent algorithm that has this characteristic. Given the means and covariance matrices of two classes, MPMC calculates a hyperplane that separates the data by minimizing the maximum probability of misclassication. As such, it generates both a classication and a bound on the expected error for future data. In the same paper, the MPMC is also extended to non-linear separating hypersurfaces using kernel methods. However, MPMC then has similar complexity as SVM algorithms. We propose an ecien t, scalable, nonparametric approach to generating nonlinear classiers based on the MPMC framework: the class of Polynomial MPMC Cascades (PMCs). PMCs are motivated by cascading algorithms like cascadecorrelation [1] and Tower [3], which sequentially add levels that improve performance. However these algorithms applied to real world problems often suer from overtting and generally scale poorly to larger problems due to the increasing number of variables used in subsequent levels of the cascades. In our cascading algorithm, for levels, instead of neural networks, we use low dimensional polynomials, after Grudic & Lawrence\u2019s Polynomial Cascade algorithm for regression [4], which ecien tly builds very high dimensional nonlinear regression surfaces using cascades of such polynomials. In this manner, we avoid the growth in learning complexity in cascade-correlation type algorithms by always projecting the intermediate outputs onto a two-dimensional state-space, and proceed from there.

To facilitate the potential customer discovery process, a costly and labor intensive manual selection process is done to build a brand portfolio consisting of multimedia data relevant to the brand. To automate this process in a cost-effective way, in this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Distance Metric Learning (M2DML) method, which learns a data-dependent similarity metric from multi-modal media data, aiming at assisting the brands to retrieve appropriate media data from social networks for potential customer discovery. To comprehensively model the supervised information of multi-modal data, M2DML aims to learn both the intra-modality and inter-modality distance metrics simultaneously.

A key justification of the theory is provided by a theorem linking invariant representations to small sample complexity for recognition that is, invariant representations allows learning from very few labeled examples. The theory characterizes how an algorithm that can be implemented by a set of \u201dsimple\u201d and \u201dcomplex\u201d cells a \u201dHW module\u201d \u2013 provides invariant and selective representations. The invariance can be learned in an unsupervised way from observed transformations. Theorems show that invariance implies several properties of the ventral stream organization, including the eccentricity dependent lattice of units in the retina and in V1, and the tuning of its neurons. The theory requires two stages of processing: the first, consisting of retinotopic visual areas such as V1, V2 and V4 with generic neuronal tuning, leads to representations that are invariant to translation and scaling; the second, consisting of modules in IT, with classand object-specific tuning, provides a representation for recognition with approximate invariance to class specific transformations, such as pose (of a body, of a face) and expression. In the theory the ventral stream main function is the unsupervised learning of \u201dgood\u201d representations that reduce the sample complexity of the final supervised learning stage.

In this paper, we propose a new approach to adaptive beamforming that provides increased robustness against the mismatch problems.

Here we show that H3K27me3 enrichment increases from blastula stages onward in embryos of the Western clawed frog (Xenopus tropicalis) within constrained domains strictly defined by sequence. Strikingly, although PRC2 also binds widely to active enhancers, H3K27me3 is only deposited at a small subset of these sites. Using a Support Vector Machine algorithm, these sequences can be predicted accurately on the basis of DNA sequence alone, with a sequence signature conserved between humans, frogs, and fish. These regions correspond to the subset of blastula-stage DNA methylation-free domains that are depleted for activating promoter motifs, and enriched for motifs of developmental factors. These results imply a genetic-default model in which a preexisting absence of DNA methylation is the major determinant of H3K27 methylation when not opposed by transcriptional activation.

By sampling the GANs latent space, we generate an image that is as visually close to the query image as possible. Because the AnoGAN has learned a distribution over non-defective parts, it can only produce images without defects.

This study proposes a practical use of a reengineered Multi-Agent Intelligent Simulator (MAIS) to numerically examine several reasons on why the crisis has occurred during May 2000-Janurary 2001. The proposed MAIS generates artificially numerous trading agents equipped with different learning capabilities and duplicates their bidding strategies in the California electricity markets during the crisis period. In this study, we confirm the methodological validity of MAIS by comparing the estimation accuracy of MAIS with those of the three well-known computer science techniques (Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms). This study also investigates the dynamic change on agent composition in a time horizon. This investigation finds that all agents gradually shift to multiple learning capabilities so as to adjust themselves to the price fluctuation of electricity. Finally, we apply the sensitivity analysis of MAIS to identify economic rationales concerning the crisis. The sensitivity analysis results in the estimation accuracy (91.15%) during the crisis period.

{"paper_id": "54625695", "title": "An Automated Pipeline for Variability Detection and classification for the Small Telescopes Installed at the Liverpool Telescope", "authors": [{"first": "Paul", "middle": ["R."], "last": "McWhirter", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "The Small Telescopes at the Liverpool Telescope (STILT) is an almost decade old project to install a number of wide field optical instruments to the Liverpool Telescope, named Skycams, to monitor weather conditions and yield useful photometry on bright astronomical sources. The motivation behind this thesis is the development of algorithms and techniques which can automatically exploit the data generated during the first 1200 days of Skycam operation to catalogue variable sources in the La Palma sky. A previously developed pipeline reduces the Skycam images and produces photometric time-series data named light curves of millions of objects. 590,492 of these objects have 100 or more data points of sufficient quality to attempt a variability analysis. The large volume and relatively high noise of this data necessitated the use of Machine Learning and sophisticated optimisation techniques to successfully extract this information. The Skycam instruments have no control over the orientation and pointing of the Liverpool Telescope and therefore resample areas of the sky highly irregularly. The term used for this resampling in astronomy is \u2018cadence\u2019. The unusually irregular Skycam cadence places increased strain on the algorithms designed for the detection of periodicity in light curves. This thesis details the development of a period estimation method based on a novel implementation of a genetic algorithm combined with a generational clustering method. Named GRAPE (Genetic Routine for Astronomical Period Estimation), this algorithm deconstructs the space of possible periods for a light curve into regions in which the genetic population clusters. These regions are then fine-tuned using a k-means clustering algorithm to return a set of independent period candidates which are then analysed using a Vuong closeness test to discriminate between aliased and true periods. This thesis demonstrates the capability of GRAPE on a set of synthetic light curves built using traditional regular cadence sampling and Skycam style cadence for four different shapes of periodic light curve. The performance of GRAPE on these light curves is compared to a more traditional periodogram which returns a set of peaks and is then analysed using Vuong closeness tests. GRAPE obtains similar performance compared to the periodogram on all the light curve shapes but with less computational complexity allowing for more efficient light curve analysis. Automated classification of variable light curves has been explored over the last decade. Multiple features have been engineered to identify patterns in the light curves of different classes of variable star. Within the last few years deep learning has come to prominence as a method of automatically generating informative representations of the data for the solution of a desired problem, such as a classification task. A set of models using Random Forests, Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks were trained using a set of variable Skycam light curves of five classes. Using 16 features engineered from previous methods an Area under the Curve (AUC) of 0.8495 was obtained. Replacing these features with inputs from the pixel intensities from a 100 by 20 pixel image representation, produced an AUC of 0.6348, which improved to 0.7952 when provided with additional context to the dimensionality of the image. Despite the inferior performance, the importance of the different pixels produced relations in the trained models demonstrating that they had produced features based on well-understood patterns in the different classes of light curve. Using features produced by Richards et al. and Kim & Bailer-Jones et al., a set of features to train machine learning classification models was constructed. In addition to this set of features, a semi-supervised set of novel features was designed to describe the shape of light curves phased around the GRAPE candidate period. This thesis investigates the performance of the PolyFit algorithm of Prsa et al., a technique to fit four piecewise polynomials with discontinuous knots capable of connecting across the phase boundary at phases of zero and one. This method was designed to fit eclipsing binary phased light curves however were also described to be fully capable on other variable star types. The optimisation method used by PolyFit is replaced by a novel genetic algorithm optimisation routine to fit the model to Skycam data with substantial improvement in performance. The PolyFit model is applied to the candidate period and twice this period for every classified light curve. This interpolation produces novel features which describe similar statistics to the previously developed methods but which appear significantly more resilient to the Skycam noise and are often preferred by the trained models. In addition, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to investigate a set of 6897 variable light curves and discover that the first ten principal components are sufficient to describe 95\\% of the variance of the fitted models. This trained PCA model is retained and used to generate twenty novel shape features. Whilst these features are not dominant in their importance to the learned models, they have above average importance and help distinguish some objects in the light curve classification task. The second principal component in particular is an important feature in the discrimination of short period pulsating and eclipsing variables as it appears to be an automatically learned robust skewness measure. The method described in this thesis produces 112 features of the Skycam light curves, 38 variability indices which are quickly obtainable and 74 which require the computation of a candidate period using GRAPE. A number of machine learning classifiers are investigated to produce high-performance models for the detection and classification of variable light curves from the Skycam dataset. A Random Forest classifier uses a training set of 859 light curves of 12 object classes to produce a classifier with a multi-class F1 score of 0.533. It would be computationally infeasible to produce all the features for every Skycam light curve, therefore an automated pipeline has been developed which combines a Skycam trend removal pipeline, GRAPE and our machine learned classifiers. It initialises with a set of Skycam light curves from objects cross-matched from the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) Variable Star Index (VSI), one of the most comprehensive catalogues of variable stars available. The learned models classify the full 112 features generated for these cross-matched light curves and confident matches are selected to produce a training set for a binary variability detection model. This model utilises only the 38 variability indices to identify variable light curves rapidly without the use of GRAPE. This variability model, trained using a random forest classifier, obtains an F1 score of 0.702. Applying this model to the 590,492 Skycam light curves yields 103,790 variable candidates of which 51,129 candidates have been classified and are available for further analysis.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.24377/researchonline.ljmu.ac.uk.00009479", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2895980756", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54625695"}

The introduction of artificial intelligence, especially machine learning algorithms, has made it possible to design more effective RO strategies. However, the model trained by current machine learning algorithms is only suitable for specific scenarios, and cannot be applied to new scenarios, resulting in the need to retrain the models in the new scenario and increase the training costs. Transfer learning (TL) can solve this problem by collecting a small amount of training data in the new scenario and strengthening the existing related models. This paper proposes a RO strategy for resource reservation based on TL in SDM-EONs. If the AR requests fail to reserve resources, TL will be used to predict the spectrum defragmentation time to complete the resource optimization before their start time. For the IR requests, they will occupy the low-level AR requests with the latest start time.

RNA-seq based transcriptome sequencing has been extensively used for identification of lncRNAs. However, accurate identification of lncRNAs in RNA-seq datasets is crucial for exploring their characteristic functions in the genome as most coding potential computation (CPC) tools fail to accurately identify them in transcriptomic data. Well-known CPC tools such as CPC2, lncScore, CPAT are primarily designed for prediction of lncRNAs based on the GENCODE, NONCODE and CANTATAdb databases. The prediction accuracy of these tools often drops when tested on transcriptomic datasets. This leads to higher false positive results and inaccuracy in the function annotation process. In this study, we present a novel tool, PLIT, for the identification of lncRNAs in plants RNA-seq datasets. PLIT implements a feature selection method based on L1 regularization and iterative Random Forests (iRF) classification for selection of optimal features. Based on sequence and codon-bias features, it classifies the RNA-seq derived FASTA sequences into coding or long non-coding transcripts. Using L1 regularization, 31 optimal features were obtained based on lncRNA and protein-coding transcripts from 8 plant species.

Classification problem especially for high dimensional datasets have attracted many researchers in order to find efficient approaches to address them. However, the classification problem has become very complicated and computationally expensive, especially when the number of possible different combinations of variables is so high. In this research, we evaluate the performance of four basic classifiers (naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbour, decision tree and rule induction), ensemble classifiers (bagging and boosting) and Support Vector Machine. We also investigate two widely-used feature selection algorithms which are Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Our experiments show that feature selection algorithms especially GA and PSO significantly reduce the number of features needed as well as greatly reduce the computational cost. Furthermore, these algorithms do not severely reduce the classification accuracy and in some cases they can improve the accuracy as well. PSO has successfully reduced the number of attributes of 9 datasets to 12.78% of original attributes on average while GA is only 30.52% on average. In terms of classification performance, GA is better than PSO. The datasets reduced by GA have better classification performance than their original ones on 5 of 9 datasets while the datasets reduced by PSO have their classification performance improved in only 3 of 9 datasets. The total running time of four basic classifiers (NB, kNN, DT and RI) on 9 original datasets is 68,169 seconds while the total running time of the same classifiers on GA-reduced datasets is 3,799 seconds and on PSO-reduced dataset is only 326 seconds (more than 209 times faster). We applied ensemble classifiers such as bagging and boosting as a comparison. Our experiment shows that bagging and boosting do not give a significant improvement. The average improvement of bagging when applied to nine datasets is only 0.85% while boosting average improvement is 1.14%. Ensemble classifiers (both bagging and boosting) outperforms single classifier in 6 of 9 datasets. SVM has been proven to perform much better when dealing with high dimensional datasets and numerical features. Although SVM work well with default value, the performance of SVM can be improved significantly using parameter optimization. Our experiment shows SVM parameter optimization using grid search always finds near optimal parameter combination within the given ranges. SVM parameter optimization using grid search is very powerful and it is able to improve the accuracy significantly. Unfortunately, grid search is very slow; therefore it is very reliable only in low dimensional dataset with few parameters. SVM parameter optimization using Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) can be used to solve the problem of grid search. EA has proven to be more stable than grid search. Based on average running time, EA is almost 16 times faster than grid search (294 seconds compare to 4680 seconds). Overall, SVM with parameter optimization outperforms other algorithms in 5 of 9 datasets.

Employing the Random Forest method, we were able to predict whether a drug binds to a soluble or membrane protein with an average accuracy of 84 % and an average area under curve of 0.91. The high average performance suggests that there exist some general physico-chemical differences between drugs that bind to membrane and soluble protein targets. Variable importance measures in combination with permutation tests were used to find the most influential descriptors. This resulted in six outstanding descriptors, that all involve drug flexibility and lipophilicity, suggesting that drugs binding to membrane protein targets are in general more flexible and lipophilic, and conversely, drugs binding to soluble protein targets are more rigid and hydrophilic.

However, to draw mechanistic conclusions, a biochemical understanding of these mutations is necessary. For coding mutations, accurate prediction of significant changes in either the stability of proteins or their affinity to their binding partners is required. Traditional methods have used semi-empirical force fields, while newer methods employ machine learning of sequence and structural features. Here, we show how combining both of these approaches leads to a marked boost in accuracy. We introduce ELASPIC, a novel ensemble machine learning approach that is able to predict stability effects upon mutation in both, domain cores and domain-domain interfaces. We combine semi-empirical energy terms, sequence conservation, and a wide variety of molecular details with a Stochastic Gradient Boosting of Decision Trees (SGB-DT) algorithm. The accuracy of our predictions surpasses existing methods by a considerable margin, achieving correlation coefficients of 0.77 for stability, and 0.75 for affinity predictions. Notably, we integrated homology modeling to enable proteome-wide prediction and show that accurate prediction on modeled structures is possible. Lastly, ELASPIC showed significant differences between various types of disease-associated mutations, as well as between disease and common neutral mutations.

Previous works have focused on learning feature embeddings based on metric learning with triplet comparisons and rely only on the qualitative distinction of similar and dissimilar pose labels. In contrast, we consider the exact pose differences between the training samples, and aim to learn embeddings such that the distances in the pose label space are proportional to the distances in the feature space. However, since it is less desirable to force the pose-feature correlation when objects are symmetric, we discuss the use of weights that reflect object symmetry when measuring the pose distances. Furthermore, end-to-end pose regression is investigated and is shown to further boost the discriminative power of feature learning, improving pose recognition accuracies. Experimental results show that the features that are learnt guided by poses, are significantly more discriminative than the ones learned in the traditional way, outperforming state-of-the-art works. Finally, we measure the generalisation capacity of pose guided feature learning in previously unseen scenes containing objects under different occlusion levels, and we show that it adapts well to novel tasks.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICCV.2017.416", "venue": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)", "journal": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2777195424", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2810831", "121049", "16080844", "16805301", "11214635", "11133572", "12971705", "42441056", "14980684", "206944272", "2784676", "6962442", "2123767", "12888763", "5954518", "5956214", "3237692", "15022990", "2082300", "4648939", "206592766", "8632684", "14124313", "206685792", "1395439", "4649936", "971626", "1418616"], "inbound_citations": ["199064307", "197635980", "52953916", "51892714", "199384008", "73488479", "47021681", "73728977", "59222093", "72941026", "198909171", "210168357", "210701529", "4140974", "204939801", "210942662", "52966594", "208816241", "210889242", "210697751", "116357067", "76665948", "210971281", "199541942", "210911622", "59158997", "59158997", "204900842", "204800604", "204837916", "201067849", "201698155"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9309452"}

One of the proposed methods to achieve both goals for subway service is to implement real time train arriving countdown clocks in subway stations. Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) of New York City (NYC) chose to install such countdown clocks in their stations starting from 2007 on a selection of subway lines. Due to the recent development of Bluetooth Beacon technology, the MTA could now install countdown clocks and train trackers in a non intrusive manner with much faster speed. As a result, the MTA is aiming to install countdown clocks in every subway station on every line. However, with such an aggressive plan, the impact of countdown clocks on subway ridership has not been fully studied. This paper proposes using Panel Regression methods, specifically, Random Effect (RE) model and Fixed Effect (FE) model to quantify the impact of countdown clocks on subway ridership. Machine Learning methods, namely Random Forest (RF) with AdaBoost and Decision Tree (DT) Regression, are also used as alternative data driven approaches for the FE and RE model. The results show that for the G line service, which runs between Brooklyn and Queens, the introduction of countdown clocks could increase weekly ridership by about 1783 per station. The study also found that the machine learning methods provide better accuracy in predicting the ridership than RE and FE models.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1901.00748", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2907120153", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["117897944", "15619865", "109797486", "115871091", "56320217", "8813050", "119566587", "109277490", "64121921", "3093707", "1384650", "110030444", "13252401", "8124468", "108733250", "96456585", "135259126", "56408721"], "inbound_citations": ["59316522"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:57375762"}

Cancer classification requires well founded mathematical methods which are able to predict the status of new specimens with high significance levels starting from a limited number of data. In this paper we assess the performances of Regularized Least Squares (RLS) classifiers, originally proposed in regularization theory, by comparing them with Support Vector Machines (SVM), the state-of-the-art supervised learning technique for cancer classification by DNA microarray data. The performances of both approaches have been also investigated with respect to the number of selected genes and different gene selection strategies.ResultsWe show that RLS classifiers have performances comparable to those of SVM classifiers as the Leave-One-Out (LOO) error evaluated on three different data sets shows. The main advantage of RLS machines is that for solving a classification problem they use a linear system of order equal to either the number of features or the number of training examples. Moreover, RLS machines allow to get an exact measure of the LOO error with just one training.ConclusionRLS classifiers are a valuable alternative to SVM classifiers for the problem of cancer classification by gene expression data, due to their simplicity and low computational complexity. Moreover, RLS classifiers show generalization ability comparable to the ones of SVM classifiers also in the case the classification of new specimens involves very few gene expression levels.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC1866388", "pubmed_id": "16351746", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-6-S4-S2", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2130672573", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["2914506", "14686653", "2478905", "2698102", "1069019", "14649834", "209955551", "49743910", "10445998", "121952650", "58799660", "9061359", "11625473", "15140283", "7055940", "61649919", "123067933"], "inbound_citations": ["52801236", "6366032", "495077", "7572482", "15615616", "629949", "18439689", "219337", "626971", "17054144", "670603", "9177827", "51937145", "11798097", "8244471"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3218248"}

CRF provide a probabilistic classification framework including local spatial and temporal context. Although context is known to improve image analysis results, so far only little research was carried out on how to model it. Taking into account context is the main benefit of CRF in comparison to many other classification methods. Context can be already considered by the choice of features and in the design of the interaction potentials that model the dependencies of interacting sites in the CRF.

In particular, our method is essentially a Bayesian extension to a previous classic DML method\u2014large margin nearest neighbor classification and we use stochastic variational inference to estimate the posterior distribution of the transformation matrix. Furthermore, we theoretically show that the proposed algorithm is robust against label noise in the sense that an arbitrary point with label noise has bounded influence on the learnt model.

Empirical results from six station data sets indicate that: 1) the PM 2.5 concentrations of Shenzhen experiences a regular fluctuation during the 24 h of the whole day with the peak value in working hours due to factory and vehicle emissions. 2) Spatial difference of PM 2.5 concentrations is not noticeable because of the geographical and meteorological conditions. 3) The proposed hybrid model generates a more reliable and accurate forecast capability. 4) The proposed hybrid model analyses the time series data with possibly conditional heteroscedasticity characteristics and estimates the variance for the volatility of the PM 2.5 concentrations.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.apr.2017.01.003", "venue": null, "journal": "Atmospheric Pollution Research", "mag_id": "2590890587", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["201983829", "125415597", "133603978", "204842930", "26936591", "204243224", "2169898", "195804870", "204229665", "211505954"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:114861648"}

WGANs is exactly a context of solving a zero-sum game with simultaneous no-regret dynamics. Moreover, we show that optimistic mirror decent addresses the limit cycling problem in training WGANs. We formally show that in the case of bi-linear zero-sum games the last iterate of OMD dynamics converges to an equilibrium, in contrast to GD dynamics which are bound to cycle. We also portray the huge qualitative difference between GD and OMD dynamics with toy examples, even when GD is modified with many adaptations proposed in the recent literature, such as gradient penalty or momentum. We apply OMD WGAN training to a bioinformatics problem of generating DNA sequences. We observe that models trained with OMD achieve consistently smaller KL divergence with respect to the true underlying distribution, than models trained with GD variants.

However, model-based diagnostic methods, like non-linear gas path analysis (GPA) and genetic algorithms, need an accurate gas turbine model, and diagnostic methods without gas turbine model, like artificial neural networks, need a large number of experimental data. Both are difficult to gain. Support vector machine (SVM), a novel computational learning method with excellent performance, seems to be a good choice for gas path fault diagnostic of gas turbine without engine model. In this paper, SVM is employed to diagnose a deteriorated gas turbine. And the diagnostic result of SVM is compared to the result of artificial neural networks. The comparing result confirms that SVM has an obvious advantage over artificial neural networks method based on a small sample of data, and can be employed to gas path fault diagnostic of gas turbine. Additionally, SVM with radial basis kernel function is the best choice for gas turbine gas path fault diagnostic based on small sample.Copyright \u00a9 2014 by ASME", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1115/IMECE2014-36367", "venue": "Volume 6A: Energy", "journal": "Volume 6A: Energy", "mag_id": "2101089708", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:110558405"}

This type of analysis is commonly referred to as variable importance analysis. Parametric methods used to estimate these effects are prone to bias. This bias is often the result of incorrect model specification and improper inference for the parameter of interest. Alternative machine learning techniques, such as Random Forest, often result in abstract measures of importance whose inference depends on a computationally intensive bootstrap analysis. In this thesis, robust estimators for variable importance based on targeted maximum likelihood methodology are presented and developed for three types of outcomes (1) univariate continuous, (2) multivariate continuous, and (3) binary outcome. These estimators are specifically designed to target the effect of a variable of interest on an outcome while adjusting for confounders when the variable of interest is of general form (i.e. continuous or discrete). When the outcome is continuous (1,2), the effect is on an additive scale. When the outcome is binary (3), the effect is on a multiplicative scale, and the importance measure is a relative risk. The estimators are developed under a flexible semiparametric model, in which only components related to the variable of interest must be fully specified, and effect modification can be easily incorporated. Based on targeted maximum likelihood theory, the presented estimators are double robust and locally efficient, and correct inference for the parameter of interest is available using the corresponding influence curve. In this thesis, the three estimators relating to the three outcomes are derived from targeted maximum likelihood methodology and implemented by adapting standard statistical regression software. These estimators are applied in both simulation and application. In a simulated biomarker discovery analysis, the robustness of the estimator for a univariate continuous outcome is compared to other common methods of variable importance under increasing correlation among the covariates. In a repeated measures setting, the double robust property of the estimator for a multivariate continuous outcome is demonstrated in simulation, and the estimator is applied in a transcription factor analysis to determine the activity level of transcription factors during the cell cycle in yeast. For a binary outcome, the estimator for the relative risk is applied to estimate the effect of HIV genetic susceptibility scores on viral response. Effect modification is also explored and model selection methodology is introduced.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "111287968", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["51745339"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:117117106"}

They were asked to indicate their instantaneous emotional state in a valence-arousal (V-A) space, using a joystick. Subsequently, five analyses were undertaken: (i) a System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire unveiled the framework's excellent usability; (ii) MANOVA analysis of the mean V-A ratings and (iii) trajectory similarity analyses of the annotations confirmed the successful elicitation of emotions; (iv) Change point analysis of the annotations, revealed a direct mapping between emotional events and annotations, thereby enabling automatic detection of emotionally salient points in the videos; and (v) Support Vector Machines (SVM) were trained on classification of 5 second chunks of annotations as well as their change-points.

Observations, communications, and knowledge about the world-state are designed to be information-sparse, modeling real-world uncertainty. We propose a solution to Defender by means of the well-known multiagent learning algorithm fictitious play, and compare it with rational learning, regret matching, minimax regret, and a simple greedy strategy.

We show fictitious play's performance to be superior at evenly assigning predators to prey in spite of it being an incomplete and imperfect information game that is continually changing its dimension and payoff.

Moreover, our connectionist account predicts that these two effects are more pronounced under conditions of self-priming that render characteristics of the self more accessible. Two experiments using minimal groups demonstrate (a) that ingroup favoritism is due to self-anchoring or the projection of self features in the ingroup, (b) that outgroup derogation is a direct consequence of self-competition (i.e., contrasting away from the self) rather than of contrasting away from the ingroup, (c) that self-priming (by making self-evaluations first) leads to more pronounced evaluation of the self, and to more contrastive evaluation of the ingroup and outgroup.

While many graph frameworks have made substantial progress in optimizing these applications, we show that it is still possible to achieve up to 5\u00d7 speedups over the fastest frameworks by greatly improving cache utilization. Previous systems have applied out-of-core processing techniques from the memory/disk boundary to the cache/DRAM boundary. However, we find that blindly applying such techniques is ineffective because the much smaller performance gap between cache and DRAM requires new designs for achieving scalable performance and low overhead. We present Cagra, a cache optimized inmemory graph framework. Cagra uses a novel technique, CSR Segmenting, to break the vertices into segments that fit in last level cache, and partitions the graph into subgraphs based on the segments.

To make the process more efficient and reduce the time between receiving and escalating the user request, we aim to automate of the complete user request management process. We propose a holistic method called ESSMArT. The methods performs text summarization, predicts ticket escalation, creates the title and content of the ticket used by developers, and assigns the ticket to an available developer. We internally evaluated the method by 4,114 user tickets from Brightsquid and their secure health care communication plat- form Secure-Mail. We also perform an external evaluation on the usefulness of the approach. We found that supervised learning based on context specific data performs best for extractive summarization. For predicting escalation of tickets, Random Forest trained on a combination of conversation and extractive summarization is best with highest precision (of 0.9) and recall (of 0.55). From external evaluation we found that ESSMArT provides suggestions that are 71% aligned with human ones. Applying the prototype implementation to 315 user requests resulted in an average time reduction of 9.2 minutes per request.

In many cases, the direct application is not easy which is true for both field assessments and remote sensing based applications. ::: For performance based payments, where forests serve as carbon sinks, the United Nations Collaborative Program on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) plays a relevant role. For Burkina Faso, a sub-Saharan country located in West Africa, selected as one of eight countries into the Forest Investment Program (FIP) to get ready for REDD+ this is a timely issue. National level data on forests are hardly available in Burkina Faso even though programs like REDD do strongly depend on the reliability of the Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) tools. ::: In many remote sensing based forest mapping studies there is no explicit reference to the quantitative and qualitative criteria used for the definition of forest. It is then, for example, difficult to scientifically compare forest cover figures from remote sensing based mapping with estimates from sample based field inventories. With this study, we would like to contribute to the discussion on the remote sensing based assessment of forest cover in larger areas. We developed a framework that combines remote sensing data of different spatial resolution and coverage. For the case of Burkina Faso, this image data was used to calculate national land use maps following the FAO forest definition and to estimate the forest cover using a model-assisted approach. We applied that framework to the complex landscape of Burkina Faso covering different dry forest types using RapidEye and MODIS images. RapidEye data was used for regional scale classification according to FAO land use definitions. For the up-scaling to national level the classified RapidEye data was used as input for MODIS classification. Classification on regional as well as national level was done using the Random Forests classifier. Estimates on forest cover were applied to the MODIS data to provide a national estimate. We compare the remote sensing based forest area figures with the estimates resulting from a (low-intensity) national level field sample based forest inventory. ::: The developed framework is suitable for the calculation of FAO conform land use maps and corresponding area estimates for Burkina Faso.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2507729070", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:132546451"}

The grey support vector machine model of the alkalinity enabled the development of new equation and algorithm to predict the alkalinity. During modelling, the fluctuation of data sequence was weakened by the grey theory and the support vector machine was capable of processing nonlinear adaptable information, and the grey support vector machine has a combination of those advantages.

By fine tuning the forests and significantly reducing the predictor variables, the concept detection scores are evaluated when the concept of interest is rare and imbalanced, i.e., having little collaboration with other high level concepts. Using classical multivariate statistics, estimating the value of one coordinate using other coordinates standardizes the covariates and it depends upon the variance of the correlations instead of the mean.

In this study, the support vector regression (SVR) and M5 decision tree models were used to predict the groundwater level in Ardebil plain. The monthly groundwater level data from 24 piezometers for a 17-year period (1997 to 2013) were used for training and test of models. The model inputs included the groundwater levels of previous months, the volume of entering precipitation into every cell, and the discharge of wells. The model output was the groundwater level in the current month. In order to evaluate the performance of models, the correlation coefficient (R) and the root-mean-square error criteria were used.

The use of the adapted FRFS allows the induction of low-dimensionality feature sets from feature patterns of a much higher dimensionality. To evaluate the proposed work, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNNs) and decision trees (DTREEs) based image classifiers as well as information gain rank (IGR) based feature selection are also investigated here, as possible alternatives to the underlying machine learning techniques adopted. The results of systematic comparative studies demonstrate that in general, feature selection improves the performance of classifiers that are intended for use in high dimensional domains. In particular, the proposed approach helps to increase the classification accuracy, while enhancing classification efficiency by requiring considerably less features. This is evident in that the resultant SVM-based classifiers which utilise FRFS-selected features generally outperform KNN and DTREE based classifiers and those which use IGR-returned features.

Twitter is a logical source of data for hate speech analysis since users of twitter are more likely to express their emotions of an event by posting some tweet. This analysis can help for early identification of hate speech so it can be prevented to be spread widely. The manual way of classifying out hateful contents in twitter is costly and not scalable. Therefore, the automatic way of hate speech detection is needed to be developed for tweets in Indonesian language.

The experiment results showed that using ensemble method can improve the classification performance. The best result is achieved when using soft voting with F1 measure 79.8% on unbalance dataset and 84.7% on balanced dataset.

A fundamental operation in graph data management is computing the similarity between two graphs. However, due to the large scale and high dimensionality of real graph databases, computing graph similarity becomes a challenging problem in real settings. Many graph data management tasks, such as graph mining, classification, and retrieval, can be contextualized in the framework of graph kernels. A graph kernel is, roughly speaking, a function that computes the similarity between graph structures as means to enable the application of linear methods to graph data. Nevertheless, large databases usually require the use of compact representations of graphs known as graph fingerprints (or signatures). Graph fingerprinting techniques provide a solution that is a trade-off among accuracy, efficiency, and compression in graph kernels. In this paper, we study the problem of generating fingerprints for graph kernels. We introduce a graph fingerprinting technique based on the min-hashing scheme, which is a powerful strategy for computing the similarity between large sets of items using a small amount of data. An algorithm for the generation of graph fingerprints as vectors of min-hash values is presented and integrated into the framework of graph kernels.

They are indicators of cognitive health status and their assessment is a measure of independence in everyday living. ADL are difficult to reliably assess using questionnaires due to self-reporting biases. Various sensor-based (wearable, in-home, intrusive) systems have been proposed to successfully recognize and quantify ADL without relying on self-reporting. New classifiers required to classify sensor data are on the rise. We propose two ad-hoc classifiers that are based only on non-intrusive sensor data.MethodsA wireless sensor system with ten sensor boxes was installed in the home of ten healthy subjects to collect ambient data over a duration of 20 consecutive days. A handheld protocol device and a paper logbook were also provided to the subjects. Eight ADL were selected for recognition. We developed two ad-hoc ADL classifiers, namely the rule based forward chaining inference engine (RBI) classifier and the circadian activity rhythm (CAR) classifier. The RBI classifier finds facts in data and matches them against the rules. The CAR classifier works within a framework to automatically rate routine activities to detect regular repeating patterns of behavior. For comparison, two state-of-the-art [Na\u00efves Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF)] classifiers have also been used. All classifiers were validated with the collected data sets for classification and recognition of the eight specific ADL.ResultsOut of a total of 1,373 ADL, the RBI classifier correctly determined 1,264, while missing 109 and the CAR determined 1,305 while missing 68 ADL. The RBI and CAR classifier recognized activities with an average sensitivity of 91.27 and 94.36%, respectively, outperforming both RF and NB.ConclusionsThe performance of the classifiers varied significantly and shows that the classifier plays an important role in ADL recognition. Both RBI and CAR classifier performed better than existing state-of-the-art (NB, RF) on all ADL. Of the two ad-hoc classifiers, the CAR classifier was more accurate and is likely to be better suited than the RBI for distinguishing and recognizing complex ADL.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4457983", "pubmed_id": "26048452", "doi": "10.1186/s12938-015-0050-4", "venue": "Biomedical engineering online", "journal": "Biomedical engineering online", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1501671177", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["43453909", "39176284", "141973968", "25849472", "27495946", "205693904", "13202089", "41485104", "2819869", "16508014", "9543729", "10015368", "39161265", "1251790", "140109802", "19794092", "17152181", "15761943", "9014589", "10241496", "58357076", "7165393", "89141", "2791599", "11016126", "12472523", "696216", "13651537"], "inbound_citations": ["20510218", "215009185", "3015305", "13701320", "1423584", "2941593", "80169442", "3555142"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12566631"}

This paper demonstrates how even high-dimensional learning problems of this kind can successfully be dealt with by techniques from nonparametric regression and locally weighted learning. As an example, we de- scribe the application of one of the most advanced of such algorithms, Locally Weighted Projection Regression (LWPR), to the on-line learning of the inverse dynamics model of an actual seven degree-of-freedom anthro- pomorphic robot arm. LWPR's linear computational complexity in the number of input dimensions, its inherent mechanisms of local dimensionality reduction, and its sound learning rule based on incremental stochastic leave- one-out cross validation allows - to our knowledge for the first time - implementing inverse dynamics learning for such a complex robot with real-time performance. In our sample task, the robot acquires the local inverse dynamics model needed to trace a figure-8 in only 60 seconds of training. An increasing number of learning problems involves real-time modeling of complex high-dimensional processes. Typical examples include the on-line modeling of dynamic processes observed by visual surveillance, user model- ing for advanced computer interfaces and game playing, and the learning of value functions, policies, and internal models for learning control. Among the characteristics of these learning problems are high dimensional input spaces with potentially redundant and irrelevant dimensions, nonstationary input and output distributions, essentially in- finite training data sets with no representative validation sets, and the need for continual learning. Most of these learning tasks fall into the domain of regression problems. Interestingly, this class of problems has so far not been conquered by the new developments in statistical learn- ing. Bayesian inference (3) is usually computationally too expensive for real-time application as it requires repre- sentation of the complete joint probablity densities of the data. The framework of structural risk minimization(9), the most advanced in form of Support Vector Machines, excels in classification and finite batch learning problems, but has yet to show compelling performance in regression and incremental learning. In contrast, techniques from nonparametric regression, in particular the methods of locally weighted learning (2), have recently advanced to meet all the requirements of real-time learning in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we will describe how one of the most highly developed algorithms amongst them, Locally Weighted Projection Regression (LWPR), accomplishes learning of a highly nonlinear model for robot control- the inverse dynamics model of a seven degree-of-freedom (DOF) anthropomorophic robot. In the following sections, we will first explain the learning task, then spell out the LWPR algorithm, and finally illustrate learning results from real-time learning on the actual robot.

In a traditional supervised machine learning setting, a system can only use labeled data from a single dataset to solve a given task. The labels associated with the dataset define the nature of the task to solve. A key advantage of transfer learning is in leveraging knowledge from related tasks to improve performance on a given target task. One way to transfer knowledge is to learn a shared latent representation across related tasks. This method has shown to be beneficial in many domains of machine learning, but has yet to be explored in MIR. Many MIR datasets for audio classification present a semantic overlap in their labels. Furthermore, these datasets often contain relatively few songs. Thus, there is a strong case for exploring methods to share knowledge between these datasets towards a more general and robust understanding of high level musical concepts such as genre and similarity.

As a result wireless networks growing importance they are susceptible to various attacks- spoofing, phishing which works as path for so many other forms of attacks on the wireless networks. Cryptographic authentication methods provide verification of nodes identity, but since much effort is required in authentication key management and additional infrastructural load it\u2019s not always possible. So a method/way for detecting spoofing attacks, and locating the positions of adversaries performing the attacks is proposed. Use of spatial information, a physical property associated with each and every node, which is difficult to falsify, and independent of cryptographic functions, as the basis for detecting the spoofing attacks, determining the number of attackers when multiple adversaries are masquerading as the same node identity and locating multiple adversaries. To be more precise K-means cluster analysis model that utilizes spatial information of received signal strength (RSS) inherited from wireless nodes is used to find the spoofing attacks and cluster-based mechanisms can be developed to determine the number of attackers. Ultimately the positions of the attackers can be identified using either area/ point-based localization algorithms with the same relative errors as in the normal case.

Audio, as a significant part of video, provides important cues to human perception when humans are browsing and understanding video contents. To detect semantic content by useful audio information, we introduce audio keywords which are sets of specific audio sounds related to semantic events. In our previous work, we designed a hierarchical Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for audio keyword identification. However, a weakness of our previous work is that audio signals are artificially segmented into 20 ms frames for frame-based SVM identification without any contextual information. In this paper, we propose a classification method based on Hidden Markov Modal (HMM) for audio keyword identification as an improved work instead of using hierarchical SVM classifier. Choosing HMM is motivated by the successful story of HMM in speech recognition. Unlike the frame-based SVM classification followed by major voting, our proposed HMM-based classifiers treat specific sound as a continuous time series data and employ hidden states transition to capture context information. In particular, we study how to find an effective HMM, i.e., determining topology, observation vectors and statistical parameters of HMM. We also compare different HMM structures with different hidden states, and adjust time series data with variable length.

This topic exhibits considerable aid especially to cancer research. Therefore, an influential number of biological and medical researchers have to deal with the datasets obtained from microarray experiments. Usage of these huge datasets is not efficient in terms of time and cost. Thus, many researchers contribute to tumor classification via effective use of microarray technologies for cancer research. To be able to obtain the most relevant subset containing the signature genes that are included in the pathway of certain diseases and therefore capable of classifying the entire data, is very crucial for true disease diagnosis. There are several approaches in the literature for this classification purpose. In this thesis, we present an approach to use, Genetic Algorithms for this feature subset selection problem. Genetic Algorithm is combined with Support Vector Machines for the calculation of classification accuracies of each gene. These classification accuracies denote the survival probabilities of the genes in our algorithm. The genes having higher classification accuracy will have more probability to survive. Three different real life cancer datasets are used for the tests. Our algorithm converged to better results then all other approaches in the literature. In colon tumor dataset which is one of our test datasets, we were able to classify the entire data with the accuracy of 100% using only 4 features ( genes ).

All persons must be logically identified before being authorized to interact with the robot while continuous tracking is compulsory in order to estimate the person\u2019s approximate position. A first contribution relates to experiments of still-image-based face recognition methods in order to check which image projection and classifier associations give the highest performance of the face database acquired from our robot. Our approach, based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) improved by genetic algorithm optimization of the freeparameters, is found to outperform conventional appearance-based holistic classifiers (eigenface and Fisherface) which are used as benchmarks. Relative performances are analyzed by means of Receiver Operator Characteristics which systematically provide optimized classifier free-parameter settings. Finally, for the SVM-based classifier, we propose a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to obtain optimized free-parameter settings. The second and central contribution is the design of a complete still-to-video face recognition system, dedicated to the previously identified person, which integrates face verification, as intermittent features, and shape and clothing color, as persistent cues, in a robust and probabilistically motivated way. The particle filtering framework, is well-suited to this context as it facilitates the fusion of different measurement sources. Automatic target recovery, after full occlusion or temporally disappearance from the field of view, is provided by positioning the particles according to face classification probabilities in the importance function. Moreover, the multi-cue fusion in the measurement function proves to be more reliable than any other individual cues. Evaluations on key-sequences acquired by the robot during long-term operations in crowded and continuously changing indoor environments demonstrate the robustness of the tracker against such natural settings. Mixing all these cues makes our video-based face recognition system work under a wide range of conditions encountered by the robot during its movements.

We propose a prediction model on general features of documents using stacking with ensemble learning. Term Frequency/Inverse Document Frequency (TF/IDF) features are inputs to stacking of Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Trees and the outputs of the base learners are encapsulated with decision tree to make final training of the model. The results exhibits that our approach gives the accuracy of 92.19% which outperform the state-of-the-art method.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1088/1742-6596/933/1/012012", "venue": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series", "journal": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series", "mag_id": "2781502290", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67315240"}

Therefore, the development of a highly accurate carcinogenicity prediction system to interpret short-term test results would be beneficial. The Ames test is popular for mutagens; however, it cannot detect non-genotoxic carcinogens. Previously, we reported a prediction system using gene expression data obtained from a short-term (28-day) study that screened candidate compounds for testing in long-term carcinogenicity studies. In this study, our system was improved by adding more gene expression data. To establish our new system, we used the data of 93 test compounds (41 hepatocarcinogens and 52 non-hepatocarcinogens). Analysis of liver gene expression data by dividing compounds into 'for training' and 'for test' categories (20 cases assigned randomly) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) identified a set of marker probe sets that could be used to predict hepatocarcinogenicity. The assigned 42 probe sets have included the cancer- or c-Myc-related genes such as Hsp90, Pink1, Hspc111, Fbx29, Hepsin, Syndecan2 and Synbindin. Compared with the older version, the improved system had a higher concordance rate with the training data and a good performance with the external test data.

An individual video possesses unique motion features, color histograms, motion histograms, text features, audio features, features extracted from faces and objects existing in its frames. Videos containing useful information and occupying significant space in the databases are under-utilized unless CBVR systems capable of retrieving desired videos by sharply selecting relevant while filtering out undesired videos exist. Results have shown performance improvement (higher precision and recall values) when features suitable to particular types of videos are utilized wisely.

Consequently, to ease this challenge this paper aims to achieve high accuracy system with a minimum set of features. The proposed model uses two methods, namely \u2015SVM features selection\u2016 and the common \u2015Correlation-based Feature Subset Selection (CFS)\u2016 for the feature dimensions reduction part. In addition, two different classifiers, one Support Vector Machine and the other Neural Network are separately adopted to identify the six emotional states of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and neutral. The method has been verified using Persian (Persian ESD) and German (EMO-DB) emotional speech databases, which yield high recognition rates in both databases. The results show that SVM feature selection method provides better emotional speech-recognition performance compared to CFS and baseline feature set. Moreover, the new system is able to achieve a recognition rate of (99.44%) on the Persian ESD and (87.21%) on Berlin Emotion Database for speaker-dependent classification.

However, these methods usually are time-consuming and do not take incremental learning into consideration at all, thus they may not be suitable for online applications. Therefore, in this paper we rethink the problem of Web page classification by only using URLs and propose an efficient Url-Pattern based Classification Algorithm (named UPCA). Specifically, given a set of training samples with the same label, we first construct a pattern tree and extract main patterns from it. Then we can classify new Web pages by matching their URLs to the patterns. Also, we propose an efficient incremental pattern-tree algorithm.

First, the data on the parameters of system resources and application server are collected. Then, the data is preprocessed by normalization and principal component analysis (PCA). Then, ELMs are constructed to model the extracted data series of systematic parameters. Finally, we get the predicted data of system resource by computing the sum of the outputs of these ELMs. Experiments show that the proposed software aging prediction method based on wavelet transform and ELM is superior to the artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) in the aspects of prediction precision and efficiency.

In addition, the effect of heritability, marker density, and reference population size on the accuracy of genomic prediction and its persistency over time was also studied. To this end, a genome comprised of 3 chromosomes on which 6000 bi-allelic SNP with equal initial frequency of 0.5 were arrayed was simulated. For assessing the genotype imputation, respectively, 5%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 90% and 95% of genotypes were masked and then imputed with Random Forest algorithm. Two reference population size of 1000 and 5000 animals and two marker densities of 20 SNPs and 100 SNPs per centimorgan were considered. Correlation coefficient between the true and predicted genomic breeding values (rp,t) was used as the prediction accuracy. The imputation accuracy (IA) decreased in parallel to increase in the percentage of imputed genotypes. It was \u22481 when only 5% of genotypes were imputed; however, as the proportion of masked genotypes increased beyond 70%, a rapid decline in IA was observed. In addition, by increasing the percentage of masked genotypes, rp,t decreased in such a way that it decreased from 0.78 to, respectively, 0.77, 0.75, 0.73, 0.70, 0.61, and 0.51 when, respectively, 5%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 90% and 95% of genotypes were imputed. Therefore, genotype imputation could be used effectively to decrease the cost of genomic selection. Significant increases were observed in accuracy of genomic prediction following increase in heritability, marker density and reference population size. With a heritability level of 0.2, marker density of 20 SNPs/cM and a reference population size of 1000 individuals, after 9 generations derived from the reference population, the accuracy decreased by 26% (0.78 to 0.57). By increasing marker density to 100 SNP/cM, the rp,t decreased by 16% (from 0.88 to 0.72). Moreover, by increasing reference population size from 1000 to 5000 individuals, the accuracy decreased by 14% (from 0.92 to 0.79) after 9 generations. In addition, by increasing heritability from 0.2 to 0.5, after 9 generations, there was 14% decrease in rp,t. It was concluded that increasing the reference population size and marker density could be effective strategies to prevent decrease in accuracy of genomic evaluation over time.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.genrep.2019.100425", "venue": null, "journal": "Gene Reports", "mag_id": "2946313508", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:181741769"}

While it can greatly increase the scope and benefits of the current security surveillance systems, performing such a task using thermal images is a challenging problem compared to face recognition task in the Visible Light Domain (VLD). This is partly due to the much smaller amount number of thermal imagery data collected compared to the VLD data. Unfortunately, direct application of the existing very strong face recognition models trained using VLD data into the thermal imagery data will not produce a satisfactory performance. This is due to the existence of the domain gap between the thermal and VLD images. To this end, we propose a Thermal-to-Visible Generative Adversarial Network (TV-GAN) that is able to transform thermal face images into their corresponding VLD images whilst maintaining identity information which is sufficient enough for the existing VLD face recognition models to perform recognition. Some examples are presented in Figure 1. Unlike the previous methods, our proposed TV-GAN uses an explicit closed-set face recognition loss to regularize the discriminator network training. This information will then be conveyed into the generator network in the forms of gradient loss. In the experiment, we show that by using this additional explicit regularization for the discriminator network, the TV-GAN is able to preserve more identity information when translating a thermal image of a person which is not seen before by the TV-GAN.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1712.02514", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICB2018.2018.00035", "venue": "2018 International Conference on Biometrics (ICB)", "journal": "2018 International Conference on Biometrics (ICB)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2774965559,2963276927,2952736603", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7926903", "12656473", "12209503", "206594692", "123837435", "23977028", "8016908", "18369864", "9433631", "6200260", "980236", "9143238", "6628106", "12722327", "17716267", "972639", "12148790", "5345397", "12803511", "4637184", "11758569", "15606297", "3719281", "16261698", "206592766", "5127896", "14124313", "21011865", "1541706", "4711865", "17188384", "15951875", "185542", "1277217"], "inbound_citations": ["198145997", "67855819", "211990694", "4032266", "202779027", "214594107", "208041260", "197677696", "211677908", "58671426", "54075199", "198909788", "209853152", "59222436", "163164324", "211685939", "202778754", "195718535", "195329411", "173179799", "49559640", "204801182", "57572931", "54525766", "201620376", "118685884", "211132872", "209439913", "199058847", "209458914", "58672958"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:24170821"}

Nowadays more than 10 million people worldwide are affected and this number is increasing at a rate of 60 thousands new diagnoses per year in US only. It has an impact on the US healthcare industry of 23 billion dollars per year represented by direct and indirect costs. Periodically quantify the severity of the symptoms is important to arrange the medication doses and schedule the intake times to avoid or keep at minimum the side effects of the medications and keeping always a low level of impairment caused by the symptoms. This is a problem of drug titration, typical of those drugs that have a wearing off effect, like Levodopa, used for Parkinson's Disease. Today to quantify the severity of motor symptoms, simulated tasks are performed by patients under the observation of clinicians who patiently assigns scores to each task. These procedures take a lot of time to both patients and clinicians and represent an important part of the total cost upon the healthcare industry. Wearable sensors and modern techniques of data analysis and Artificial Intelligence can help in this task by predicting the severity of motor and non motor symptoms, allowing for continuous monitoring, objective analysis and saving time and money to patients and hospitals. The Motion Analysis Laboratory (Harvard Medical School) collected data from 27 patients with Parkinson's Disease, during performed tasks in the laboratory environment and simulated activity of daily life (SADL) in an apartment-like environment. This thesis is part of a bigger project where different hospitals and universities in Boston, MA are involved called BlueSky project. Aim of this project is to use all the information from all different kind of sensors (accelerometric and physiological data) to accurately predict changes in the severity of Parkinson for both motor and non-motor symptoms. The main focus of the thesis is on the analysis of accelerometric data acquired from wrists and feet. However the first months have been spent analyzing other physiological data such as Galvanic Skin Response and Heart Rate Variability for the study of non motor symptoms. Finally, a machine learning approach has been used. Different regressor models have been tested, the focus has been on the study of temporal patterns through Recurrent Neural Networks, the overall error is reported in terms of Root Mean Squared Error as used in regression problems, however the characteristics of the classifier are derived from the regressor to a better comparison among different models.

Some scholars have found that the kernel outputs are frequently of similar levels, which insinuate the redundancy of SVs. By analyzing the overlapped information of kernel outputs, a succinct separating-hyperplane-securing method for pruning the dispensable SVs based on crosswise propagation (CP) is systematically developed. The method also circumvents the problem of explicitly discerning SVs in feature space as the SVM formulation does. Experiments with the famous SMO-based software LibSVM reveal that all typical kernels with different parameters on the data sets contribute the dispensable SVs. Some 1% ~ 9% (in some scenarios, more than 50%) dispensable SVs are found. Furthermore, the experimental results also verify that the pruning method does not alter the SVMs' performances at all.

It has attracted increasing research interest in pattern recognition and machine learning. Traditionally, person re-ID is formulated as a metric learning problem with binary classification output. However, higher order relationship, such as triplet closeness among the instances, is ignored by such pair-wise based metric learning methods. Thus, the discriminative information hidden in these data is insufficiently explored. This paper proposes a new structured loss function to push the frontier of the person re-ID performance in realistic scenarios. The new loss function introduces two margin parameters. They operate as bounds to remove positive pairs of very small distances and negative pairs of large distances. A trade-off coefficient is assigned to the loss term of negative pairs to alleviate class-imbalance problem. By using a linear function with the margin-based objectives, the gradients w.r.t. weight matrices are no longer dependent on the iterative loss values in a multiplicative manner. This makes the weights update process robust to large iterative loss values. The new loss function is compatible with many deep learning architectures, thus, it induces new deep network with pair-pruning regularization for metric learning. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets. The results indicate that the new loss together with the ResNet-50 backbone has excellent feature representation ability for person re-ID.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.patcog.2019.106995", "venue": "Pattern Recognit.", "journal": "Pattern Recognit.", "mag_id": "2966198677", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201251762"}

The approach comprises of using Random Forests to identify variables with the most predictive power which are then used to permute interaction terms with other variables to build improved scorecards using logistic regression. The problem with most credit scorecards is that they use logistic regression which does not account for multi-collinearity and thus during model construction one cannot gauge variable importance using p values. Thus traditional credit scorers have steered clear of interaction terms and exploratory analysis using logistic regression. Random forest variable selection overcomes that short coming and also provide a good benchmark for the estimating the flat maximum the asymptote of predictive power constraining the model. In addition, conditional inference trees were also used along with recursive partitioning to identify segments of data, as well. Conditional inferences trees identified 20 segments using age, payment date and other variables which traditional recursive partitioning could not detect and also outperformed traditional recursive partitioning. In addition to showing random forests to be power tools and models superior to logistic regression on a large credit card dataset the paper concludes by showing random forest performance against logistic regression on a widely used home equity dataset.

Toward this end, the basic GAN formulation achieves it by super-resolving and refining sequentially (e.g. SR-GAN and cycle-GAN).

However, the study of carbohydrate sugar chains has lagged behind compared to that of DNA and proteins, mainly due to their inherent structural complexity. However, their analysis is important because they serve various important roles in biological processes, including signaling transduction and cellular recognition. In order to glean some light into glycan function based on carbohydrate structure, kernel methods have been developed in the past, in particular to extract potential glycan biomarkers by classifying glycan structures found in different tissue samples. The recently developed weighted qgram method (LK-method) exhibits good performance on glycan structure classification while having limitations in feature selection. That is, it was unable to extract biologically meaningful features from the data. Therefore, we propose a biochemicallyweighted tree kernel (BioLK-method) which is based on a glycan similarity matrix and also incorporates biochemical information of individual q-grams in constructing the kernel matrix. We further applied our new method for the classification and recognition of motifs on publicly available glycan data. Our novel tree kernel (BioLK-method) using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is capable of detecting biologically important motifs accurately while LK-method failed to do so. It was tested on three glycan data sets from the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) GLYCAN and showed that the results are consistent with the literature. The newly developed BioLK-method also maintains comparable classification performance with the LK-method. Our results obtained here indicate that the incorporation of biochemical information of q-grams further shows the flexibility and capability of the novel kernel in feature extraction, which may aid in the prediction of glycan biomarkers.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3280441", "pubmed_id": "22347783", "doi": "10.6026/97320630007405", "venue": "Bioinformation", "journal": "Bioinformation", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2041929070", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15135836"}

However, existing HCRF models of image segmentation do not allow multiple classes to be assigned to a single region, which limits their ability to incorporate contextual information across multiple scales. At higher scales in the image, this representation yields an oversimplified model since multiple classes can be reasonably expected to appear within large regions. This simplified model particularly limits the impact of information at higher scales. Since class-label information at these scales is usually more reliable than at lower, noisier scales, neglecting this information is undesirable. To address these issues, we propose a new consistency potential for image labeling problems, which we call the harmony potential.

How miRNA genes are regulated receives considerable attention because it directly affects miRNA-mediated gene regulatory networks. Although numerous prediction models were developed for identifying miRNA promoters or transcriptional start sites (TSSs), most of them lack experimental validation and are inadequate to elucidate relationships between miRNA genes and transcription factors (TFs). Here, we integrate three experimental datasets, including Cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) tags, TSS Seq libraries, and H3K4me3 chromatin signature derived from high-throughput sequencing analysis of gene initiation, to provide direct evidence of miRNA TSSs, thus establishing an experimental-based resource of human miRNA TSSs, named miRStart. Moreover, a machine learning based Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is developed to systematically identify representative TSSs for each miRNA gene. Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed resource, an important human intergenic miRNA, hsa-miR-122, is selected to experimentally validate putative TSS owing to its high expression in a normal liver. In conclusion, this work successfully identify 847 human miRNA TSSs (292 of them are clustered to 70 TSSs of miRNA clusters) based on the utilization of high-throughput sequencing data from TSS-relevant experiments, and establish a valuable resource for biologists in advanced research in miRNA-mediated regulatory networks.

This work is devoted to developing a system for the detection of microcalcification in digital mammograms. After removing noise from mammogram using the Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT), we first selected the region of interest (ROI) in order to demarcate the breast region on a mammogram. Segmenting region of interest represents one of the most important stages of mammogram processing procedure. The proposed segmentation method is based on a filtering using the Sobel filter. This process will identify the significant pixels, that belong to edges of microcalcifications. Microcalcifications were detected by increasing the contrast of the images obtained by applying Sobel operator.

The focus in many applications is to investigate an effective classifier in terms of accuracy. The conventional multiclass classifiers have the ability to map the class of interest but the considerable efforts and large training sets are required to fully describe the classes spectrally. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is suggested in this paper to deal with the multiclass problem of hyperspectral imagery. The attraction to this method is that it locates the optimal hyper plane between the class of interest and the rest of the classes to separate them in a new high-dimensional feature space by taking into account only the training samples that lie on the edge of the class distributions known as support vectors and the use of the kernel functions made the classifier more flexible by making it robust against the outliers. A comparative study has undertaken to find an effective classifier by comparing Support Vector Machine (SVM) to the other two well known classifiers i.e. Maximum likelihood (ML) and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM). At first, the Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) was applied to extract the best possible features form the hyperspectral imagery and then the resulting subset of the features was applied to the classifiers. Experimental results illustrate that the integration of MNF and SVM technique significantly reduced the classification complexity and improves the classification accuracy.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1088/1742-6596/439/1/012042", "venue": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series", "journal": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1964505487", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["140661913", "206787478", "194951"], "inbound_citations": ["16459218", "58956785", "16755984", "5050487", "207853076", "29804375", "207830725", "210996000", "210875695", "213429073", "53482073", "126002639"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:565871"}

India is the second largest producer of tea in the world after China, but every year Tea plants are attacked by several pests and diseases that are responsible for 7-10% loss of the crop. Tea growers spray pesticides on the plants for better control on the pests and to reduce crop loss. The uncontrolled usage of pesticide with ineffective management practices results in high residue levels that are hazardous to human health. In this paper, an attempt has been made to detect the pesticide residue on the tea leaves using hyperspectral sensing. The data on leaves treated with three banned chemicals (Acetamiprid, Cypermethrin and Monocrotophos) and control healthy leaves was collected using spectroradiometer in the spectral range of 350-1052 nm in 213 narrow contiguous bands. The spectral observations of the leaf samples (total of 389 samples) in control and treated with each chemical on consecutive days (i.e. from 1 to 7 days) has been collected. The data in 213 narrow contiguous bands is used as feature set for hyperspectral data analysis. The band selection methods are used to overcome collinearity in spectral observations due to contiguous data. Band selection has been performed by 1. Visual Analysis, 2. Principal Component Analysis and 3. Random Forest based feature importance method. The performance of various classifiers such as Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Linear Discriminant Analysis has been evaluated using different feature sets and classification scenarios. The classification scenarios considered for each pesticide are 1. two class classification with control and pesticide treated samples, 2. three class classification using control samples, 1 and 2 days after pesticide application, 3. four class classification using control samples, 1, 2 and 3 days after pesticide application and 4. eight class classification with control samples and 1-7 days after application. The PCA based feature selection method was found effective among all. The two class classification scenario of control vs treated provided the best classification performance by using the SVM classifier (accuracy of 98.29%) for all the three pesticides (89.04-98.29%).

Each individual model is trained with data pertaining to a single horizon, thus it can be specific for that horizon, but can use fewer data for training than the global model, which is constructed with data belonging to all horizons. Support Vector Machines have been used for constructing the individual and global models.

In this thesis, we first created our own dataset for North American Traffic Signs, which is still being updated. We then decided to choose Histogram Orientation Gradients (HOG) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to build our system after comparing them with some other techniques. For better results, we tested different HOG parameters to find the best combination. After this, we developed a TSDR system using HOG, SVM and our new color information extraction algorithm. To reduce time-consumption, we used the Maximally Stable Extremal Region (MSER) to replace the HOG and SVM detection stage. In addition, we developed a new approach based on Global Positioning System (GPS) information other than image processing.

Complexity arguments usually make it prohibitive to analyse such datasets in their entirety. We examine two schemes that allow an ILP system to construct theories by sampling from this large pool of data. The first, \u201csubsampling\u201d, is a single-sample design in which the utility of a potential rule is evaluated on a randomly selected sub-sample of the data. The second, \u201clogical windowing\u201d, is multiple-sample design that tests and sequentially includes errors made by a partially correct theory. Both schemes are derived from techniques developed to enable propositional learning methods (like decision trees) to cope with large datasets. The ILP system CProgol, equipped with each of these methods, is used to construct theories for two datasets\u2014one artificial (a chess endgame) and the other naturally occurring (a language tagging problem). In each case, we ask the following questions of CProgol equipped with sampling: (1) Is its theory comparable in predictive accuracy to that obtained if all the data were used (that is, no sampling was employed)?; and (2) Is its theory constructed in less time than the one obtained with all the data? For the problems considered, the answers to these questions is \u201cyes\u201d.

The idea is inspired by the ensemble approach, i.e., the use of several classifiers to solve a problem. Compared to using only one classifier, the ensemble of classifiers has the advantage of reducing the overall variance of the system. Instead of using multiple classifiers, we propose here to examine other possible means of variance reduction (VR), namely through the use of multiple synthetic samples, different extractors (features) and biometric modalities. The scores are combined using the average operator, Multi-Layer Perceptron and Support Vector Machines. It is found empirically that VR via modalities is the best technique, followed by VR via extractors, VR via classifiers and VR via synthetic samples. This order of effectiveness is due to the corresponding degree of independence of the combined objects (in decreasing order). The theoretical and empirical findings show that the combined experts via VR techniques always perform better than the average of their participating experts.

The system performs three sub-tasks: concept extraction, assertion classification, and relation identification. ::: ::: Design The overall system consists of five steps: (1) pre-processing sentences, (2) marking noun phrases (NPs) and adjective phrases (APs), (3) extracting concepts that use a dosage-unit dictionary to dynamically switch two models based on Conditional Random Fields (CRF), (4) classifying assertions based on voting of five classifiers, and (5) identifying relations using normalized sentences with a set of effective discriminating features. ::: ::: Measurements Macro-averaged and micro-averaged precision, recall and F-measure were used to evaluate results. ::: ::: Results The performance is competitive with the state-of-the-art systems with micro-averaged F-measure of 0.8489 for concept extraction, 0.9392 for assertion classification and 0.7326 for relation identification. ::: ::: Conclusions The system exploits an array of common features and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Prudent feature engineering sets the foundation of our systems. In concept extraction, we demonstrated that switching models, one of which is especially designed for telegraphic sentences, improved extraction of the treatment concept significantly. In assertion classification, a set of features derived from a rule-based classifier were proven to be effective for the classes such as conditional and possible. These classes would suffer from data scarcity in conventional machine-learning methods.

In particular, stiffness generalization has not been well considered. This paper develops a framework that enables the robot to learn both movement and stiffness features from the human tutor. To this end, the upper limb muscle activities of the human tutor are monitored to extract variable stiffness in real time, and the estimated human arm endpoint stiffness is properly mapped into the robot impedance controller. Then, a dynamic movement primitives model is extended and employed to simultaneously encode the movement trajectories and the stiffness profiles. In this way, both position trajectory and stiffness profile are considered for robot motion control in this paper to realize a more complete skill transfer process. More importantly, stiffness generalization and movement generalization can be efficiently realized by the proposed framework.

Computational drug design has the potential to help save time and money by providing a better starting point for new drugs with an initial computational evaluation completed. We propose a new application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), called GANDALF (Generative Adversarial Network Drug-tArget Ligand Fructifier) to design new peptides for protein targets. Other GAN based methods for computational drug design can only generate small molecules, not peptides. It also incorporates data such as active atoms, not used in other methods, which allow us to precisely identify where interaction occurs between a protein and ligand. Our method goes farther than comparable methods by generating a peptide and predicting binding affinity. We compare results for a protein of interest, PD-1, using: GANDALF, Pepcomposer, and the FDA approved drugs. We find that our method produces a peptide comparable to the FDA approved drugs and better than that of Pepcomposer. Further work will improve the GANDALF system by deepening the GAN architecture to improve on the binding affinity and 3D fit of the peptides.

The most common type of medical data is the massive free-text electronic medical records (EMR). It is widely regarded that mining such massive data can bring up important information for improving medical practices as well as for possible new discoveries on complex diseases. However, the free EMR texts are lacking consistent standards, rich of private information, and limited in availability. Also, as they are accumulated from everyday practices, it is often hard to have a balanced number of samples for the types of diseases under study. These problems hinder the development of ML and NLP methods for EMR data analysis. To tackle these problems, we developed a model to generate synthetic text of EMRs called Medical Text Generative Adversarial Network or mtGAN. It is based on the GAN framework and is trained by the REINFORCE algorithm. It takes disease features as inputs and generates synthetic texts as EMRs for the corresponding diseases. We evaluate the model from micro-level, macro-level and application-level on a Chinese EMR text dataset. The results show that the method has a good capacity to fit real data and can generate realistic and diverse EMR samples. This provides a novel way to avoid potential leakage of patient privacy while still supply sufficient well-controlled cohort data for developing downstream ML and NLP methods.

The initiation of flower development and the formation of different floral organs are the results of the interplays among numerous genes. But until now, just fewer genes have been found linked with flower development. And the functions of lots of genes of Arabidopsis thaliana are still unknown. Although, the quartet model successfully simplified the ABCDE model to elaborate the molecular mechanism by introducing protein-protein interactions (PPIs). We still don't know much about several important aspects of flower development. So we need to discriminate even more genes involving in the flower development. In this study, we identified seven differentially modules through integrating the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) method to analyze co-expression network and PPIs using the public floral and non-floral expression profiles data of Arabidopsis thaliana. Gene set enrichment analysis was used for the functional annotation of the related genes, and some of the hub genes were identified in each module. The potential floral organ morphogenesis genes of two significant modules were integrated with PPI information in order to detail the inherent regulation mechanisms. Finally, the functions of the floral patterning genes were elucidated by combining the PPI and evolutionary information. It was indicated that the sub-networks or complexes, rather than the genes, were the regulation unit of flower development. We found that the most possible potential new genes underlining the floral pattern formation in A. thaliana were FY, CBL2, ZFN3 and AT1G77370; among them, FY, CBL2 acted as an upstream regulator of AP2; ZFN3 activated the flower primordial determining gene AP1 and AP2 by HY5/HYH gene via photo induction possibly. And AT1G77370 exhibited similar function in floral morphogenesis, same as ELF3. It possibly formed a complex between RFC3 and RPS15 in cytoplasm, which regulated TSO1 and CPSF160 in the nucleus, to control the floral organ morphogenesis.

The advantage of mutual neighbors is that pseudo nearest neighbors can be identified and will not be taken into account during the prediction process.

In this work, we explore the techniques that can automatically predict the permission requests of a new mobile app based on its functionality and textual description information, which can help users to be aware of the privacy risks of mobile apps.

In this article, we take fashion images as an example to show how Markov Random Fields (MRFs) can outperform Conditional Random Fields when the application does not follow a certain statistical model learned from the training data set. We propose a new method for automatically parsing fashion images in high processing efficiency with significantly less training time by applying a modification of MRFs, named reweighted MRF (RW-MRF), which resolves the problem of over smoothing infrequent labels. We further enhance RW-MRF with occlusion prior and background prior to resolve two other common problems in clothing parsing, occlusion, and background spill.

In this paper, we propose a deep model for segmenting organs in CBCT images without requiring labelled training CBCT images. By taking advantage of the available segmented computed tomography (CT) images, our adversarial learning domain adaptation method aims to synthesize CBCT images from CT images. Then the segmentation labels of the CT images can help train a deep segmentation network for CBCT images, using both CTs with labels and CBCTs without labels. Our adversarial learning domain adaptation is integrated with the CBCT segmentation network training with the designed loss functions. The synthesized CBCT images by pixel-level domain adaptation best capture the critical image features that help achieve accurate CBCT segmentation.

Efficient and timely prediction of defect occurrence in software allows software project managers to effectively utilize people, cost, time for better quality assurance. The presence of defects in a software leads to a poor quality software and also responsible for the failure of a software project. Sometime it is not possible to identify the defects and fixing them at the time of development and it is required to handle such defects any time whenever they are noticed by the team members. So it is important to predict defect-prone software modules prior to deployment of software project in order to plan better maintenance strategy. Early knowledge of defect prone software module can also help to make efficient process improvement plan within justified period of time and cost. This can further lead to better software release as well as high customer satisfaction subsequently. Accurate measurement and prediction of defect is a crucial issue in any software because it is an indirect measurement and is based on several metrics. Therefore, instead of considering all the metrics, it would be more appropriate to find out a suitable set of metrics which are relevant and significant for prediction of defects in any software modules. This paper proposes a feature selection based Linear Twin Support Vector Machine (LSTSVM) model to predict defect prone software modules. F-score, a feature selection technique, is used to determine the significant metrics set which are prominently affecting the defect prediction in a software modules. The efficiency of predictive model could be enhanced with reduced metrics set obtained after feature selection and further used to identify defective modules in a given set of inputs.

Adequate data is usually a prerequisite, especially when deep learning is adopted. However, the development levels of different cities are unbalanced, and still many cities suffer from data scarcity. To address the problem, we propose a novel cross-city transfer learning method for deep spatio-temporal prediction tasks, called RegionTrans. RegionTrans aims to effectively transfer knowledge from a data-rich source city to a data-scarce target city. More specifically, we first learn an inter-city region matching function to match each target city region to a similar source city region. A neural network is designed to effectively extract region-level representation for spatio-temporal prediction. Finally, an optimization algorithm is proposed to transfer learned features from the source city to the target city with the region matching function. Using citywide crowd flow prediction as a demonstration experiment, we verify the effectiveness of RegionTrans.

The classification hierarchy is represented as a Markov network equipped with an exponential family defined on the edges. We present a variation of the maximum margin multilabel learning framework, suited to the hierarchical classification task and allows efficient implementation via gradient-based methods. We compare the behaviour of the proposed method to the recently introduced hierarchical regularized least squares classifier as well as two SVM variants in Reuter\u2019s news article classification. Often in hierarchical classification, the object to be classified is assumed to belong to exactly one (leaf) node in the hierarchy (c.f. [?, ?, ?]). Following [1], in this paper we consider the more general case where a single object can be classified into several categories in the hierarchy, to be specific, the multilabel is a union of partial paths in the hierarchy. For example, a news article about David and Victoria Beckham could belong to partial paths sport, football and entertainment, music but might not belong to any leaf categories such as champions league or jazz. In our setting the training data ((xi,y(xi))) m i=1 consists of pairs (x,y) of vector x \u2208 R and a multilabel y \u2208 {+1,\u22121} consisting of k microlabels. As the model class we use the exponential family P (y|x) \u221d \u220f e\u2208E exp ( w e \u03c6e(x,ye) ) = exp ( w\u03c6(x,y) ) (1) defined on the edges of a Markov networkG = (V,E), where node j \u2208 V corresponds to the j\u2019th component of the multilabel and the edges e = (j, j\u2032) \u2208 E correspond \u2217Corresponding author. to the classification hierarchy given as input. By ye = (yj , y\u2032 j) we denote the restriction of the multilabel y = (y1, . . . , yk) to the edge e = (j, j\u2032). The edgefeature vector \u03c6e, in turn, is a concatenation of \u2019class-sensitive\u2019 feature vectors \u03c6e (x,ye) = Jye = uK\u03c6(x), where J\u00b7K denotes an indicator function (c.f. [?]), and we is the weight vector for edge e. The vector \u03c6(x) could be a bag of words\u2014as in the experiments reported here\u2014or any other feature representation of the document x. Also, note that although the same feature vector \u03c6(x) is duplicated for each edge and edge-labeling, in the weight vector w = (we e )e\u2208E,ue we still have a separate weights to represent importance differences of a given feature in different contexts. There are many ways to define loss functions for hierarchical classification setting (c.f [?, ?, ?, 1]). Zero-one loss `0/1(y,u) = Jy 6= uK is not very well suited to the task as it ignores the severity of the discrepancy between y and u. Symmetric difference loss `\u2206(y,u) = \u2211 jJyi 6= uiK does not suffer from this deficiency. However, it fails to take the dependency structure of the microlabels into account. A more appealling choice is the hierarchical loss function of [1]. It penalizes the first mistake along a path, `PATH(y,u) = \u2211 j cjJyj 6= uj & yk = uk\u2200k \u2208 anc(j)K, where the coefficients croot = 1, cj = cpa(j)/|sibl(j)| down-weight mistakes made deeper in the hierarchy.

Getting these robots to work in the complex and diverse world that we live in has proven to be a difficult challenge. Interestingly, one of the most significant successes in the last decade of AI has been the use of Machine Learning (ML) to generalize about and robustly handle diverse situations. From detecting objects in cluttered visual scenes to translating sentences between languages, ML has become an integral part of modern technology. So why don\u2019twe just apply current learning algorithms to robots? Arguably, one of the biggest reason is the lack of large-scale data. A key ingredient that sparked progress in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing was internet-scale data: 1-10 million labelled images for computer vision; 100 million word-pairs for language translation. Unfortunately, this scale of data is not available for robots. Hence, effectively integrating learning to robots requiresus to rethink our use of robotic data. In this thesis we draw inspiration from other data driven fields of AI (Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, etc.) to develop data-centric robot learning techniques. However, unlike the aforementioned fields, robotics involves interactions with real hardware systems, which presents three unique challenges for large-scale learning. The first challengeis the physical nature of robotics where every piece of data needs to be executed on a real system. To scalably collect large amounts of data with minimal human supervision, wepresent \u2018self-supervised\u2019 robot learning techniques where the robot both collects and labels real-world data. From manipulating unseen objects in new homes to avoiding previously unseen obstacles while flying, we demonstrate that large-scale, self-supervised data, when combined with off-the-shelf ML tools, can produce generalizable robotic skills. The second challenge is that real robots are slow, which limits the amount of data we can collect even with \u2018self-supervised\u2019 techniques. This limitation necessitates the development of algorithms that can efficiently utilize available robot data. We do this by instilling notionsof robustness via adversaries and sharing representations across multiple tasks. Finally, in several applications, robotic data may not be easy or practical to collect. Insuch scenarios, we can turn to data from simulated models of the real world. Towards this, we present algorithms to learn generalizable skills in a simulator that can transfer to the real world.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1184/R1/9823772.v1", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2992318529", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214262206"}

The first main objective of this study was to use machine learning methods to predict a chronic stroke individual\u2019s motor function improvement after 6 weeks of intervention using pre-intervention demographic, clinical, neurophysiological and imaging data. The second main objective was to identify which data elements were most important in predicting chronic stroke patients\u2019 impairment after 6 weeks of intervention. Data from one hundred and two patients (Female: 31%, age 61\u00b111 years) who suffered first ischemic stroke 3-12 months prior were included in this study. After enrollment, patients underwent 6 weeks of intensive motor and transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy. Age, gender, handedness, time since stroke, pre-intervention Fugl-Meyer Assessment, stroke lateralization, the difference in motor threshold between the unaffected and affected hemispheres, absence or presence of motor evoked potential in the affected hemisphere and various imaging metrics were used as predictors of post-intervention Fugl-Meyer Assessment. Five machine learning methods, including Elastic-Net, Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Networks, Classification and Regression Trees, and Random Forest, were used to predict post-intervention Fugl-Meyer Assessment based on either demographic, clinical and neurophysiological data alone or in combination with the imaging metrics. Cross-validated R-squared and root of mean squared error were used to assess the prediction accuracy and compare the performance of methods. Elastic-Net performed significantly better than the other methods for the model containing pre-intervention Fugl-Meyer Assessment, demographic, clinical and neurophysiological data as predictors of post-intervention Fugl-Meyer Assessment (). Pre-intervention Fugl-Meyer Assessment and difference in motor threshold between affected and unaffected hemispheres were commonly found as the strongest two predictors in the clinical model. The difference in motor threshold had greater importance than the absence or presence of motor evoked potential in the affected hemisphere. The various imaging metrics, including lesion overlap with the spinal cord, largely did not improve the model performance.

High-throughput omics data in the form of molecular profile matrices, such as transcriptomes and metabolomes, have long existed as a valuable resource for facilitating diagnosis of patient statuses/stages. It is timely imperative to compare deep learning neural networks against classical machine learning methods in the setting of matrix-formed omics data in terms of classification accuracy and robustness.ResultsUsing 37 high throughput omics datasets, covering transcriptomes and metabolomes, we evaluated the classification power of deep learning compared to traditional machine learning methods. Representative deep learning methods, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), were deployed and explored in seeking optimal architectures for the best classification performance. Together with five classical supervised classification methods (Linear Discriminant Analysis, Multinomial Logistic Regression, Na\u00efve Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine), MLP and CNN were comparatively tested on the 37 datasets to predict disease stages or to discriminate diseased samples from normal samples. MLPs achieved the highest overall accuracy among all methods tested. More thorough analyses revealed that single hidden layer MLPs with ample hidden units outperformed deeper MLPs. Furthermore, MLP was one of the most robust methods against imbalanced class composition and inaccurate class labels.ConclusionOur results concluded that shallow MLPs (of one or two hidden layers) with ample hidden neurons are sufficient to achieve superior and robust classification performance in exploiting numerical matrix-formed omics data for diagnosis purpose.

Presently, there are many fruits and literature about driving drowsiness detection method. However, most of them are devoted to find a universal drowsiness detection method, while ignore the individual driver differences. This paper proposes a real-time driving drowsiness detection algorithm that considers the individual differences of driver. A deep cascaded convolutional neural network was constructed to detect the face region, which avoids the problem of poor accuracy caused by artificial feature extraction. Based on the Dlib toolkit, the landmarks of frontal driver facial in a frame are found. According to the eyes landmarks, a new parameter, called Eyes Aspect Ratio, is introduced to evaluate the drowsiness of driver in the current frame. Taking into account differences in size of driver\u2019s eyes, the proposed algorithm consists of two modules: offline training and online monitoring. In the first module, a unique fatigue state classifier, based on Support Vector Machines, was trained which taking the Eyes Aspect Ratio as input. Then, in the second module, the trained classifier is application to monitor the state of driver online. Because the fatigue driving state is gradually produced, a variable which calculated by number of drowsy frames per unit time is introduced to assess the drowsiness of driver. Through comparative experiments, we demonstrate this algorithm outperforms current driving drowsiness detection approaches in both accuracy and speed. In simulated driving applications, the proposed algorithm detects the drowsy state of driver quickly from 640 * 480 resolution images at over 20fps and 94.80% accuracy.

Given a feature-based representation of such data, methods like SVMs are able to construct good models for information extraction (IE).

So far, features have been defined manually or by using special-purpose programs: neither approach scaling well to handle the heterogeneity of the data or new domain-specific information. We suggest that Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) could assist in this. Specifically, we demonstrate the use of ILP to define features for seven IE tasks using two disparate sources of information. Our findings are as follows: (1) the ILP system is able to identify efficiently large numbers of good features. Typically, the time taken to identify the features is comparable to the time taken to construct the predictive model; and (2) SVM models constructed with these ILP-features are better than the best reported to date that rely heavily on hand-crafted features. For the ILP practioneer, we also present evidence supporting the claim that, for IE tasks, using an ILP system to assist in constructing an extensional representation of text data (in the form of features and their values) is better than using it to construct intensional models for the tasks (in the form of rules for information extraction).", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-540-78469-2_22", "venue": "ILP", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2158187543", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2706742", "2005360", "60779558", "207165665", "1452591", "16248818", "489775", "14134300", "46248", "17449687", "3055046", "118426129", "277918", "60458454", "59702881", "60827451", "7311285", "207846993", "16762143", "6517579", "39666367", "6204420", "5638493", "3263632", "149499807"], "inbound_citations": ["29828273", "17443281", "6544199", "174803467", "61180702", "207988508", "59712643", "2481603", "9267227", "40231674", "14697500", "34028114", "4302025", "5683387"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15781700"}

This study has as main objective to predict the occurrence of delays in arrivals at the international airport of Hartsfield-Jackson. A Knowledge Discovery Database (KDD) methodology was followed, and several Data Mining techniques were applied. Historical data of the flight and weather, information of the airplane and propagation of the delay were gathered to train the model.

The productivity of sugarcane is affected by many factors, among them weeds can cause several problems. Weed control is made usually by herbicides application because sugarcane occupies extensive areas, and due to the same reason, the decision about herbicide type and dosage has been done by sampling. This work mode does not allow variation and causes problems of herbicide application, since the presence and weed type may not be uniform in whole field. There are some solutions based on satellite image analysis that allow the coverage of the entire field, solving the problem caused by sampling sense, but this solution depends on high weed infestation and a clear sky for good results. This work proposes a system for weed surveying, based on image pattern recognition with pictures taken by a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle); this alternative can take pictures very close to the plants, which allows species recognition in lower infestation levels and without clouds interference.

A typical design for NLU systems consists of domain-level NLU modules (domain classifier, intent classifier and named entity recognizer). Hypotheses (NLU interpretations consisting of various intent+slot combinations) from these domain specific modules are typically aggregated with another downstream component. The re-ranker integrates outputs from domain-level recognizers, returning a scored list of cross domain hypotheses. An ideal re-ranker will exhibit the following two properties: (a) it should prefer the most relevant hypothesis for the given input as the top hypothesis and, (b) the interpretation scores corresponding to each hypothesis produced by the re-ranker should be calibrated. Calibration allows the final NLU interpretation score to be comparable across domains.

These segments are vulnerable to high misclassification level. In addressing these problems, several fundamental issues shall be emphasized: ineffective stand-alone data classification, high investment for data fusions and the need for high frequency of data collection. Thus, this research proposes a classification method consisting of two important components: Three-tier Detection (TTD) and Multi-level Synergy (MLS) after evaluating LiDAR point cloud, aerial photography, Quickbird and Landsat 7 ETM+ images. TTD which is a hierarchical and priority-based data fusion method is used to solve the vegetation and urban terrain classification while MLS, which is a synergy strategy by the utilization of single data and robust learning algorithms is used for water classification. The creation of TTD that has managed to outperform the stand-alone data classification made it a worthwhile investment while for MLS, the usage of single data is capable of meeting the high data collection demand. Both methods started with data processing such as image filtering followed by the comparison of several existing techniques for each data (rank) to identify their potentials and limitations. Next, multi-level data fusions and multi-level synergy are conducted for TTD and MLS, respectively. The dataset employed is Bukit Kanada, Sarawak which exemplifies a coastal mixed-land zone. The performance is then measured using statistical indices include overall accuracy and Kappa Index of Agreement. Both TTD and MLS outperformed recent works such as Normalized Digital Surface Model, Edge Detection technique and Support Vector Machine. Based on the success rates, TTD is suitable to be applied in planning and development sectors, management and detection of land use changes while MLS is suitable for creating maps, charts, and also in monitoring national coastline", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2614080933", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": ["13809246", "11367666", "120870661", "129585667", "27814734", "18524550", "197569845", "8584223", "32777394", "109757999", "11351238", "122268795", "7447045", "18075109", "52841643", "12737561", "129783344", "17759330", "28878665", "9010313", "54982731", "11077516", "119913034", "123450931", "86908907", "129258567", "205656385", "14910192", "11049457", "54952841", "123476171", "46046451", "18002117", "123869587", "16722861", "14389727", "18244770", "16190397"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134621707"}

Knowledge from such single-modal datasets is also very useful for cross-modal retrieval, which can provide rich general semantic information that can be shared across different modalities. However, it is challenging to transfer useful knowledge from single-modal (as image) source domain to cross-modal (as image/text) target domain. Knowledge in source domain cannot be directly transferred to both two different modalities in target domain, and the inherent cross-modal correlation contained in target domain provides key hints for cross-modal retrieval which should be preserved during transfer process.

Diff. Abstract Naming latency studies have recently shown a position-of- irregularity effect (words with early irregularities seem slowed compared to those with late irregularities), for which Dual- Route models of reading can account. Milostan & Cottrell (1998) showed that the initial studies contained a confound between irregularity position and friend/enemy ratio, and that the statistical confound could be captured by connectionist net- works which then show the supposed position effect. This pa- per presents work to disentangle the position/regularity con- found through a subject study and additional connectionist ex- plorations. The latency data show that, once friend/enemy ra- tios are controlled for, the supposed position effect is driven entirely by high-enemy words in the first position. Further, connectionist network simulations show that network error at the first phoneme position only is a better match for naming latency, while overall network error produces a better match to subject error counts. Introduction A major component of the task of learning to read is the de- velopment of a mapping from orthography to phonology. In a complete model of reading, message understanding must play a role, but many psycholinguistic phenomena can be ex- plained in the context of this simple mapping task. A dif- ficulty in learning this mapping is that in a language such as English, the mapping is quasiregular (Plaut et al., 1996); there are a wide range of exceptions to the general rules. As with nearly all psychological phenomena, more frequent stimuli are processed faster, leading to shorter naming laten- cies. The regularity of mapping interacts with this variable, a robust finding that is well-explained by connectionist ac- counts (Seidenberg and McClelland, 1989; Taraban and Mc- Clelland, 1987). In this paper we continue consideration of a recent effect that seems difficult to account for in terms of the standard par- allel network models. Coltheart & Rastle (1994) have shown that the amount of delay experienced in naming an exception word is related to the phonemic position of the irregularity in pronunciation. Specifically, the earlier the exception occurs in the word, the longer the latency to the onset of pronouncing the word. Table 1, adapted from (Coltheart and Rastle, 1994) shows the response latencies to two-syllable words by normal subjects. There is a clear left-to-right ranking of the latencies compared to controls in the last row of the Table. Coltheart et al. claim this delay ranking cannot be achieved by standard connectionist models. Earlier work (Milostan and Cottrell, 1998) showed that the origin of the effect seen in the Colt- heart study lies in a statistical regularity of English, related to Table 1: Naming Latency vs. Irregularity Position the number of \u201cfriends\u201d and \u201cenemies\u201d of the pronunciation within the word\u2019s neighborhood. 1 The human subject study and network simulations presented in this paper attempt to tease apart the effects of phoneme position and neighborhood ratio. Background Computational modeling of the reading task has been ap- proached from a number of different perspectives. Advocates of a dual-route model of oral reading claim that two separate routes, one lexical (a lexicon, often hypothesized to be an associative network) and one rule-based, are required to ac- count for certain phenomena in reaction times and nonword pronunciation seen in human subjects (Coltheart et al., 1993).

PGMs are suitable for building predictive models in medical applications, as they are powerful tools for making decisions under uncertainty from big data with missing attributes and noisy evidence. Previous work relied mostly on clinical data to create a predictive model. Moreover, practical knowledge of an expert was needed to build the structure of a model, which may not be accurate. In our opinion, since cancer is basically a genetic disease, the integration of microarray and clinical data can improve the accuracy of a predictive model. However, since microarray data is high-dimensional, including genomic variables may lead to poor results for structure and parameter learning due to the curse of dimensionality and small sample size problems. We address these problems by applying manifold learning and a deep belief network (DBN) to microarray data. First, we construct a PGM and a DBN using clinical and microarray data, and extract the structure of the clinical model automatically by applying a structure learning algorithm to the clinical data. Then, we integrate these two models using softmax nodes.

This leads to complex problems in hydrological modelling which have been widely solved by soft computing techniques. In real time flood forecasting, data generation is continuous and hence there is a need to update the developed mapping equation frequently which increases the computational burden. In short term flood forecasting where the accuracy of flood peak value and time to peak are critical, frequent model updating is unavoidable. In this paper, we studied a new technique: Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) which is capable of updating the model equation based on new data entry without much increase in computational cost. The OS-ELM was explored for use in flood forecasting on the Neckar River, Germany. The reach was characterized by significant lateral flow that affected the flood wave formation. Hourly data from 1999\u20132000 at the upstream section of Rottweil were used to forecast flooding at the Oberndorf downstream site with a lead time of 1\u20136 h. Model performance was assessed by using three evaluation measures: the coefficient of determination ( R 2 ), the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NS) and the root mean squared error (RMSE). The performance of the OS-ELM was comparable to those of other widely used Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques like support vector machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Genetic Programming (GP). The frequent updating of the model in OS-ELM gave a closer reproduction of flood events and peak values with minimum error compared to SVM, ANN and GP.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.measurement.2016.06.042", "venue": null, "journal": "Measurement", "mag_id": "2469821678", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["52816137", "133606075", "204076167", "56978152", "41324853", "158183824", "52934672", "128241299", "134036113", "56056658", "12012832", "52884011", "55489498"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:113674213"}

In this article, we propose a novel paradigm, 5G Intelligent Internet of Things (5G I-IoT), to process big data intelligently and optimize communication channels. First, we articulate the concept of the 5G I-IoT and introduce three major components of the 5G I-IoT. Then we expound the interaction among these components and introduce the key methods and techniques based on our proposed paradigm, including big data mining, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. In addition, an experimental result evaluates the performance of 5G I-IoT, and the effective utilization of channels and QoS have been greatly improved.

Papers on data mining in astronomy and classification of astronomical objects (Mahabal et al. in towards real-time classification of astronomical transients, 2008 [2]; D\u2019Isanto et al. in An analysis of feature relevance in classification of astronomical transients with machine learning methods, 2016 [3]) have paved a way for smarter manipulation of available data to extract better results. In the previous years, Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been used on astronomical data to handle classification problems in the available data whereas in some cases imaging technology and lightcurves (Faraway et al. in Modern light curves for improved classification, 2014 [4]) have been used for the given problem. Image Processing has also been used for the morphological classification of galaxy images (Shamir in Automatic morphological classification of galaxy images, 2009 [5]).

In any situation where there are a certain number of secondary networks trying to get an available channel, there arises a game theoretic competition where they want to get the channel for themselves by incurring as minimum cost as possible. The increase in cost is equivalent to the increase in time caused by the need of a search for an available channel. This process could be sped up if the networks had a predictive mechanism to determine the optimal strategy.

We propose a medical image synthesis model named abnormal-to-normal translation generative adversarial network (ANT-GAN) to generate a normal-looking medical image based on its abnormal-looking counterpart without the need for paired training data. Unlike typical GANs, whose aim is to generate realistic samples with variations, our more restrictive model aims at producing a normal-looking image corresponding to one containing lesions, and thus requires a special design. Being able to provide a \"normal\" counterpart to a medical image can provide useful side information for medical imaging tasks like lesion segmentation or classification validated by our experiments.

However, the performance of SVMs is affected harshly by skewed data sets. An SVM learns a biased model that affects the performance of the classifier. Furthermore, SVMs are typically unsuccessful on data sets where the imbalanced ratio is very large. Lately, several techniques have been used to tackle this disadvantage by generating artificial instances. Artificial data instances attempt to add information to the minority class. However, the new instances could introduce noise and decrease the performance of the classifier. In this research, an alternative procedure is suggested, the algorithm finds systematically new instances, improving the performance of SVMs on skewed data sets. The proposed method starts obtaining the support vectors (SVs) from the skewed data set.

The task of DG is challenging as we have no earlier knowledge of the target samples. If DA methods are applied directly to DG by a simple exclusion of the target data from training, poor performance will result for a given task. In this paper, we tackle the domain generalization challenge in two ways. In our first approach, we propose a novel deep domain generalization architecture utilizing synthetic data generated by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The discrepancy between the generated images and synthetic images is minimized using existing domain discrepancy metrics such as maximum mean discrepancy or correlation alignment. In our second approach, we introduce a protocol for applying DA methods to a DG scenario by excluding the target data from the training phase, splitting the source data to training and validation parts, and treating the validation data as target data for DA.

Due to some restrictions of GAN models and their lack of inference mechanism, hybrid models of GAN and VAE have emerged for image generation problem in nowadays. With the influence of these views and improvements, we have focused on addressing not only generating synthetic handwritten images but also their high-resolution version. For these tasks, Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPN), VAE and GAN models are combined inspired by an existing model with some modification of its objective function. With this model, the idea behind the inspired study for generating high-resolution images are combined with the feature-wise reconstruction objective of a VAE/GAN hybrid model instead of pixel-like reconstruction approach of traditional VAE. For evaluating the model efficiency, our VAE/CPGAN model is compared with its basis models (GAN, VAE and VAE/GAN) and inspired model accoording to inception score.

For such sonar systems, substantial effort has been devoted to the development of automated detection and classification (D/C) algorithms. These have been spurred by several factors including (1) aids for operators to reduce work overload, (2) more optimal use of all available data, and (3) the introduction of unmanned minehunting systems. The environments where sea mines are typically laid (harbor areas, shipping lanes, and the littorals) give rise to many false alarms caused by natural, biologic, and man-made clutter. The objective of the automated D/C algorithms is to eliminate most of these false alarms while still maintaining a very high probability of mine detection and classification (PdPc). In recent years, the benefits of fusing the outputs of multiple D/C algorithms have been studied. We refer to this as Algorithm Fusion. The results have been remarkable, including reliable robustness to new environments.

Various intrusion detection techniques are used, but their performance is an issue. Intrusion detection performance depends on accuracy, which needs to improve to decrease false alarms and to increase the detection rate. To resolve concerns on performance, multilayer perceptron, support vector machine (SVM), and other techniques have been used in recent work. Such techniques indicate limitations and are not efficient for use in large data sets, such as system and network data. The intrusion detection system is used in analyzing huge traffic data; thus, an efficient classification technique is necessary to overcome the issue. This problem is considered in this paper.

We tested this hypothesis using marine snails of the genus Conus from the Atlantic archipelagos of Cape Verde and Canary Islands. Together with Azores and Madeira, these archipelagos comprise the Macaronesia biogeographic region and differ remarkably in the diversity of this group. More than 50 endemic Conus species have been described from Cape Verde, whereas prior to this study, only two nonendemic species, including a putative species complex, were thought to occur in the Canary Islands. We combined molecular phylogenetic data and geometric morphometrics with bathymetric and paleoclimatic reconstructions to understand the contrasting diversification patterns found in these regions. Our results suggest that species diversity is even lower than previously thought in the Canary Islands, with the putative species complex corresponding to a single species, Conus guanche. One explanation for the enormous disparity in Conus diversity is that the amount of available habitat may differ, or may have differed in the past due to eustatic (global) sea level changes. Historical bathymetric data, however, indicated that sea level fluctuations since the Miocene have had a similar impact on the available habitat area in both Cape Verde and Canary archipelagos and therefore do not explain this disparity. We suggest that recurrent gene flow between the Canary Islands and West Africa, habitat losses due to intense volcanic activity in combination with unsuccessful colonization of new Conus species from more diverse regions, were all determinant in shaping diversity patterns within the Canarian archipelago. Worldwide Conus species diversity follows the well-established pattern of latitudinal increase of species richness from the poles towards the tropics. However, the eastern Atlantic revealed a striking pattern with two main peaks of Conus species richness in the subtropical area and decreasing diversities toward the tropical western African coast. A Random Forests model using 12 oceanographic variables suggested that sea surface temperature is the main determinant of Conus diversity either at continental scales (eastern Atlantic coast) or in a broader context (worldwide). Other factors such as availability of suitable habitat and reduced salinity due to the influx of large rivers in the tropical area also play an important role in shaping Conus diversity patterns in the western coast of Africa.

According to the geometric characteristics of SVM, in this paper we propose an online SVM classifier called VS-OSVM, which is based on convex hull vertices selection within each class. The VS-OSVM algorithm has two steps: 1) the samples selection process, in which a small number of skeleton samples constituting an approximate convex hull in each class of the current training samples are selected and 2) the online updating process, in which the classifier is updated with newly arriving samples and the selected skeleton samples. From the theoretical point of view, the first d+1 (d is the dimension of the input samples) selected samples are proved to be vertices of the convex hull. This guarantees that the selected samples in our approach keep the greatest amount of information of the convex hull.

Least Square Support Vector Machine(LS-SVM) algorithm was realized on Zynq platform by translating high-level language to Hardware Description Language(HDL).

Moreover, considering that the second parts was compute-intensive, it has been realized in logic resource by using high-level language.

Numerous traditional methods to generate fuzzing data have been developed, such as model-based fuzzing data generation and random fuzzing data generation. These techniques require the specification of the input data format or analyze the input data format by manual reverse engineering. In this paper, we introduce an approach using Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGANs), a deep adversarial learning method, to generate fuzzing data. This method does not require defining the input data format. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to use a WGAN-based method to generate fuzzing data. Industrial security has been an important and pressing issue globally. Network protocol fuzzing plays a significant role in ensuring the safety and reliability of industrial control systems (ICSs). Thus, the proposed method is significant for ICS testing. In the experiment, we use an industrial control protocol such as the Modbus-TCP protocol and EtherCAT protocol as our test target.

The social characterization is part of a larger system predicting the interruptibility of smart phone users by recording and classifying their conversations. The aspects used as characteristics are speaker emotions on the one hand and speech affects on the other hand. All predictions are based solely on auditive reception without processing the spoken text. The first part of the thesis focuses on studying different emotion classification methods on the benchmark datasets Berlin-EMO, FAU Aibo and SEMAINE. Although all datasets have been processed and classified by previous research, the focus of this approach is to include mayor disturbances such as noise and different smart phone channel effects. Also the experiments are limited to the use of Mel Frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) as input data in order to reduce the data transfer from the smart phone. The goal of imposing these limitations is to test the known classification methods within a real life environment. The algorithms applied are Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), iVectors, Anchor Models and Random Forests. The second part of the thesis focuses on predicting lower level features, namely speech affects, such as valence, arousal, power and expectation. These affects could be used for direct prediction of the interruptibility or as an intermediate step towards predicting the emotion. For applying and testing the regression of these affects, the SEMAINE dataset is used as a benchmark. Again the data is disturbed by noise and channel effects as well as reduced to MFCC features. The algorithms applied are Support Vector Regressors, Random Forest Regressors and Long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTM-RNNs). For the emotion recognition the GMM algorithm showed the best performance with 29.75\\% UAR in average over all datasets and audio types. The overall low quality of results is caused by the limitations of a real life application. For the affect regression, the best performance was reached by the Random Forest Regressor with R2 values of -1.60 for valence, -0.65 for arousal, -2.84 for expectation and -1,36 for power. Although these correlations seem very low, a transformation into a tenaer classification task (-1,0,1) reaches average recall values of 52.84 for valence, 56.04 for arousal, 53.02 for expectation and 54.010739 for power averaged over all audio types.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2746048005", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:20182935"}

We show that this procedure can significantly reduce user effort while improving the quality of the classifier on unseen test sets. Due to the limited number of supervised samples, we also propose the use of auto-encoder neural networks for feature learning. For validation, we compare the classifiers that result from the proposed approach with the ones trained from the supervised samples only and semi-supervised trained using automatic label propagation.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2018.00057", "venue": "2018 31st SIBGRAPI Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images (SIBGRAPI)", "journal": "2018 31st SIBGRAPI Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images (SIBGRAPI)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2910957910", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6035769", "16902615", "44316453", "10747436", "38625243", "171130", "207184031", "6230637", "2151537", "3116311", "18507866", "46253947", "338469", "1900911", "14618636", "15717395", "215328251", "6858787", "3960646", "53900406", "12640199", "16258268", "17804904", "38968420", "206775335", "819006", "1658773", "145183399"], "inbound_citations": ["208038645", "210134787", "202784455"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:58676148"}

The multichannel vibration signals measured at different positions on the bogies characterize the dynamics of the vehicle and contain key information describing the performance of the bogie components.

Each ROI was labeled as cystic, benign, or malignant. Features were extracted from each ROI using pre-trained CNNs and used to train support vector machine (SVM) classifiers in the tasks of distinguishing non-malignant (benign+cystic) vs malignant lesions and benign vs malignant lesions. For a baseline comparison, classifiers were also trained on prior analytically-extracted tumor features. Five-fold cross-validation (by case) was conducted with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as the performance metric. ::: ::: Results: ::: Classifiers trained on CNN-extracted features were comparable to classifiers trained on human-designed features. In the non-malignant vs malignant task, both the SVM trained on CNN-extracted features and the SVM trained on human-designed features obtained an AUC of 0.90. In the task of determining benign vs malignant, the SVM trained on CNN-extracted features obtained an AUC of 0.88, compared to the AUC of 0.85 obtained by the SVM trained on human-designed features. ::: ::: Conclusion: ::: We obtained strong results using transfer learning to characterize ultrasound breast cancer images. This method allows us to directly classify a small dataset of lesions in a computationally inexpensive fashion without any manual input. Modern deep learning methods in computer vision are contingent on large datasets and vast computational resources, which are often inaccessible for clinical applications. Consequently, we believe transfer learning methods will be important for computer-aided diagnosis schemes in order to utilize advancements in deep learning and computer vision without the associated costs. ::: ::: This work was partially funded by NIH grant U01 CA195564 and the University of Chicago Metcalf program.

{"paper_id": "123926908", "title": "Connectionist Learning Based Numerical Solution of Differential Equations", "authors": [{"first": "Susmita", "middle": [], "last": "Mall", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "It is well known that the differential equations are back bone of different physical systems. Many real world problems of science and engineering may be modeled by various ordinary or partial differential equations. These differential equations may be solved by different approximate methods such as Euler, Runge-Kutta, predictor-corrector, finite difference, finite element, boundary element and other numerical techniques when the problems cannot be solved by exact/analytical methods. Although these methods provide good approximations to the solution, they require a discretization of the domain via meshing, which may be challenging in two or higher dimension problems. These procedures provide solutions at the pre-defined points and computational complexity increases with the number of sampling points.In recent decades, various machine intelligence methods in particular connectionist learning or Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models are being used to solve a variety of real-world problems because of its excellent learning capacity. Recently, a lot of attention has been given to use ANN for solving differential equations. The approximate solution of differential equations by ANN is found to be advantageous but it depends upon the ANN model that one considers. Here our target is to solve ordinary as well as partial differential equations using ANN. The approximate solution of differential equations by ANN method has various inherent benefits in comparison with other numerical methods such as (i) the approximate solution is differentiable in the given domain, (ii) computational complexity does not increase considerably with the increase in number of sampling points and dimension of the problem, (iii) it can be applied to solve linear as well as non linear Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Moreover, the traditional numerical methods are usually iterative in nature, where we fix the step size before the start of the computation. After the solution is obtained, if we want to know the solution in between steps then again the procedure is to be repeated from initial stage. ANN may be one of the ways where we may overcome this repetition of iterations. Also, we may use it as a black box to get numerical results at any arbitrary point in the domain after training of the model.Few authors have solved ordinary and partial differential equations by combining the feed forward neural network and optimization technique. As said above that the objective of this thesis is to solve various types of ODEs and PDEs using efficient neural network. Algorithms are developed where no desired values are known and the output of the model can be generated by training only. The architectures of the existing neural models are usually problem dependent and the number of nodes etc. are taken by trial and error method. Also, the training depends upon the weights of the connecting nodes. In general, these weights are taken as random number which dictates the training. In this investigation, firstly a new method viz. Regression Based Neural Network (RBNN) has been developed to handle differential equations. In RBNN model, the number of nodes in hidden layer may be fixed by using the regression method. For this, the input and output data are fitted first with various degree polynomials using regression analysis and the coefficients involved are taken as initial weights to start with the neural training. Fixing of the hidden nodes depends upon the degree of the polynomial.We have considered RBNN model for solving different ODEs with initial/boundary conditions. Feed forward neural model and unsupervised error back propagation algorithm have been used for minimizing the error function and modification of the parameters (weights and biases) without use of any optimization technique. Next, single layer Functional Link Artificial Neural Network (FLANN) architecture has been developed for solving differential equations for the first time. In FLANN, the hidden layer is replaced by a functional expansion block for enhancement of the input patterns using orthogonal polynomials such as Chebyshev, Legendre, Hermite, etc. The computations become efficient because the procedure does not need to have hidden layer. Thus, the numbers of network parameters are less than the traditional ANN model. Varieties of differential equations are solved here using the above mentioned methods to show the reliability, powerfulness, and easy computer implementation of the methods. As such singular nonlinear initial value problems such as Lane-Emden and Emden-Fowler type equations have been solved using Chebyshev Neural Network (ChNN) model. Single layer Legendre Neural Network (LeNN) model has also been developed to handle Lane-Emden equation, Boundary Value Problem (BVP) and system of coupled ordinary differential equations. Unforced Duffing oscillator and unforced Van der Pol-Duffing oscillator equations are solved by developing Simple Orthogonal Polynomial based Neural Network (SOPNN) model. Further, Hermite Neural Network (HeNN) model is proposed to handle the Van der Pol-Duffing oscillator equation. Finally, a single layer Chebyshev Neural Network (ChNN) model has also been implemented to solve partial differential equations.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2496801593", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:123926908"}

Due to the interactions of multiple climatic factors, evaporation is considered as a complex and nonlinear phenomenon to model. Thus, machine learning methods have gained popularity in this realm. In the present study, four machine learning methods of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were used to predict the pan evaporation (PE). Meteorological data including PE, temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), wind speed (W), and sunny hours (S) collected from 2011 through 2017. The accuracy of the studied methods was determined using the statistical indices of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (R) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Furthermore, the Taylor charts utilized for evaluating the accuracy of the mentioned models. The results of this study showed that at Gonbad-e Kavus, Gorgan and Bandar Torkman stations, GPR with RMSE of 1.521 mm/day, 1.244 mm/day, and 1.254 mm/day, KNN with RMSE of 1.991 mm/day, 1.775 mm/day, and 1.577 mm/day, RF with RMSE of 1.614 mm/day, 1.337 mm/day, and 1.316 mm/day, and SVR with RMSE of 1.55 mm/day, 1.262 mm/day, and 1.275 mm/day had more appropriate performances in estimating PE values.

In this study, we present a novel approach for Input Variable Selection (IVS) that employs Binary-coded discrete Fully Informed Particle Swarm optimization (BFIPS) and Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) to develop fast and accurate IVS algorithms. A scheme is employed to encode the subset of selected inputs and ELM specifications into the binary particles, which are evolved using single objective and multi-objective BFIPS optimization (MBFIPS). The performances of these ELM-based methods are assessed using the evaluation criteria and the datasets included in the comprehensive IVS evaluation framework proposed by Galelli et al. (2014). From a comparison with 4 major IVS techniques used in their original study it emerges that the proposed methods compare very well in terms of selection accuracy. The best performers were found to be (1) a MBFIPS\u2013ELM algorithm based on the concurrent minimization of an error function and the number of selected inputs, and (2) a BFIPS\u2013ELM algorithm based on the minimization of a variant of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The first technique is arguably the most accurate overall, and is able to reach an almost perfect specification of the optimal input subset for a partially synthetic rainfall\u2013runoff experiment devised for the Kentucky River basin. In addition, MBFIPS\u2013ELM allows for the determination of the relative importance of the selected inputs. On the other hand, the BFIPS\u2013ELM is found to consistently reach high accuracy scores while being considerably faster. By extrapolating the results obtained on the IVS test-bed, it can be concluded that the proposed techniques are particularly suited for rainfall\u2013runoff modeling applications characterized by high nonlinearity in the catchment dynamics.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.08.022", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Hydrology", "mag_id": "1132038451", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["19882910", "53280428", "19483576", "5843777", "210627115", "132568739", "39901204", "12331639", "215643139", "102332793", "204076167", "124152565", "157608595", "4895260", "125925277", "135124372", "7992308", "540765", "1497758", "125265532", "149814713", "14244558", "134524889", "4327781", "199457152", "19920345", "133692525", "158225050", "56246766", "3562519", "196057671", "202917177", "134036113", "31031734", "19824280", "44380893", "202773473", "201017930", "133895534", "33091508", "55415963", "48362950", "114397128", "64674135", "113444576", "2572791", "77375818", "52021453", "53465910", "211212253", "85510116", "125771434", "2538137", "135384576", "199425196", "53392438", "55762616", "59235715", "106024618", "827815", "19427417", "3660314", "29232213", "125938190", "211540704", "126198739", "40195508", "157457686", "157457686", "158819900", "5378646", "12142149"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:127861352"}

A comparative analysis of TMPA-3B42V7 with IMD gauge-based gridded dataset was carried out on daily, monthly, seasonal and yearly basis for 16 years (1998\u20132013). The study revealed that TMPA estimates performed reasonably well with the gauge-based gridded dataset, however, some significant biases were also observed. It has been observed that TMPA overestimates at very light rain, but underestimates at light, moderate, heavy and very heavy rainfall intensities. Further, the TMPA estimates was evaluated for prediction of daily suspended sediment load (SL) employing Support Vector Machine (SVM) with wavelet analysis (WASVM). Initially, 1-day ahead SL prediction was performed using best WASVM model. The results showed that 1-day predictions were very precise and shows a better agreement with the observed SL data. Later, the developed WASVM model was used for the prediction of SL for the higher leads period. The statistical analysis shows that the developed WASVM model could predict the target value successfully up to 6-days lead and found to be not suitable for higher lead specifically in the selected watersheds with similar hydro-climatic conditions like the ones selected in this study. Predictions results of WASVM model is superior to conventional SVM model and could be used as an effective forecasting tool for hydrological applications. The study suggest that the use of TMPA precipitation estimates can be a compensating approach after suitable bias correction and have potential for SL prediction in data-sparse regions.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.04.051", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Hydrology", "mag_id": "2608783221", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["214167868", "92983243", "128298016", "134126856", "134057260", "55363679"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:132530192"}

Conventional computerized impact-echo analysis systems are built on the assumption that the (pre-collect) training echo signal and (unseen) testing echo data reside in the same feature space with identical distribution characteristic. However, in the real-world scenarios, such assumption does not hold. That is, the echo signal is often affected by practical factors, such as selection of instruments, i.e. hammer and transducers, and the change in testing specimen. From the viewpoint of pattern recognition, these factors make the posterior distribution of the test hammering echo signal drift from that of the pre-collected training echoes (with normal/defective conditions), thus will degrade the accuracy of the echo pattern analysis models. In this study, we introduce transfer learning strategy to deal with distribution drift issue between training and input echo signal. For instance, proposed system can distil discriminant echo patterns collected from (training) normal concrete and then generalize the information to detect flaws in lightweight concrete. To validate those schemes, we prepared two kinds of air-coupled transducers and three types of concretes (normal/enhanced/lightweight) with various types of inner void defects.

However, the development of irrigated perimeters around small and medium water reservoirs has put the water resources under significant pressure, given the uncontrolled exploitation and lack of efficacious management plan. Insights into changes in irrigated areas around these reservoirs are therefore crucial for their sustainable management while meeting the different agricultural water needs. They will help to center policy priorities in terms of major impacts on the reservoirs; and thereby elaborate relevant mitigation and/or adaptation strategies. The main objectives of this study were to (1) quantify the changes in irrigated land areas surrounding the Mogtedo water reservoir between 1987 and 2015; and (2) determine whether the irrigable potential of this reservoir could sustainably meet the agricultural water needs under a more variable and changing climate. A low-cost remote sensing method based on Landsat imagery (Thematic Mapper, Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, and Operational Land Imager) and using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification was developed to detect the changes in proportion of land use/land cover (LULC) in the Mogtedo region. A forward and backward change detection analysis requiring agronomic expertise was also applied to correct the pixels temporal trajectories. In addition, an intensity analysis was performed to assess land changes at time intervals, category, and transition levels. Five main LULC classes were identified: bare and hydromorphic soils, irrigated and rainfed agricultural areas, and water bodies. Overall, the classification of LULC was satisfactory with the overall accuracy and kappa coefficients ranging from 94.22 to 95.60% and 0.92 to 0.94, respectively. Results showed that LULC transformations were faster between 2000 and 2015, compared to the 1987\u20132000 period. The majority of categories (LULC classes) were active in terms of intensity of change (gain or loss) during the 1987\u20132000 and 2000\u20132015 periods, except hydromorphic soils. During these periods, the transition from rainfed agricultural areas to irrigated agricultural areas were targeted and stationary. Our findings revealed a 54% increase in irrigated areas between 1987 and 2015. The reservoir water volume decreased markedly from 9,077,000 m3 to 7,100,000 m3 during the same period. Such a decrease threatens the satisfaction of agricultural water requirements, since the reservoir is the unique source of irrigation water in the region.

SDNs bring in many benefits such as fine-grained control, possibility of optimal routing, and resource management within the network. As a result, SDNs find wider deployments in certain segments of networking such as data center networks. In addition, SDN approach is a potential candidate for the control plane design in 5G networks. Despite the benefits, SDNs face certain issues such as the possibility of single point failure, the communication overhead between switches and controllers, and more importantly the security as well as trustability of the control plane. Due to the centralized nature of the control plane, it is important to detect the presence of compromised control plane in an SDN. Compromised control plane refers to the situation where one or more of the controllers in an SDN are compromised by malwares, resulting in deviation from the normal control plane behavior. Developing new solutions for detecting the presence of compromised controllers is exacerbated by the lack of appropriate SDN traffic data sets. As a result, existing literature lacks solutions to detect the presence of a compromised control plane. Of particular interest is the case where SDN controller-specific threats hide their presence from end-users and administrators of the network. Our contributions in this paper include the following: (i) identification of five threat vectors that represent compromised controllers in SDNs, (ii) creation of a large volume of OpenFlow traffic traces in order for studying various SDN threat vectors, (iii) proposal of nine novel OpenFlow-specific features that capture the above mentioned threat vectors, and (iv) study of machine-learning based detection technique for compromised control plane using six classifiers. The OpenFlow traffic trace data set, we created, is made available for the use of larger research community. We carried out detailed experimental studies that show the efficacy of our scheme in detecting the presence of compromised controllers. Our results indicate that Random Forest is the most suitable machine learning classifier that provides about 97% accuracy.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.comnet.2018.03.021", "venue": "Comput.

In post-genomic era of sequence explosion, there is an increasing demand for developing machine learning based computational methods for the fast and accurate cytokinereceptor interaction prediction. However, the major problem lying on existing machine learning based methods is that the overall prediction accuracy is relatively low. To improve the accuracy, a crucial step is to establish a well-defined feature representation algorithm. Motivated on this perspective, we propose a novel feature representation method by integrating local information embedded in evolutionary profiles with the Pse-PSSM and AAC-PSSM-AC feature models. We further develop an improved prediction method, namely CRI-Pred, based on the proposed feature set using the Random Forest classifier. Experimental results evaluated with the jackknife test show that the CRI-Pred predictor outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, 5.1% higher in terms of the overall accuracy.

When dissimilar images are presented to the two eyes, however, perceptual integration gives way to alternation between monocular inputs, a phenomenon called binocular rivalry. Although recent evidence indicates that binocular rivalry involves a modulation of neuronal responses in extrastriate cortex, the basic mechanisms responsible for differential processing of conflicting and congruent stimuli remain unclear. Using a neural network that models the mammalian early visual system, I demonstrate here that the desynchronized firing of cortical-like neurons that first receive inputs from the two eyes results in rivalrous activity patterns at later stages in the visual pathway. By contrast, synchronization of firing among these cells prevents such competition. The temporal coordination of cortical activity and its effects on neural competition emerge naturally from the network connectivity and from its dynamics. These results suggest that input-related differences in relative spike timing at an early stage of visual processing may give rise to the phenomena both of perceptual integration and rivalry in binocular vision.", "year": 1997, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "NIPS", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2141636605", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1003907", "25933244", "4281744", "44428548", "3153331", "34876448", "4235614", "4244799", "10938578", "141763370", "42543472", "103799"], "inbound_citations": ["936526"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18792401"}

Extreme learning machines (ELMs) are an emerging form of learning model that have shown an outstanding representation ability and superior performance in a range of different learning tasks.

If one class outnumbers another, trained classifiers become heavily biased towards the majority class. For phishing URL detection, it is very natural that the number of collected benign URLs (i.e., the majority class) is much larger than the number of collected phishy URLs (i.e., the minority class). Oversampling the minority class can be a powerful tool to overcome this situation. However, existing methods perform the oversampling task in the feature space where the original data format is removed and URLs are succinctly represented by vectors. These methods are successful only if feature definitions are correct and the dataset is diverse and not too sparse. In this paper, we propose an oversampling technique in the data space. We train text generative adversarial networks (text-GANs) with URLs in the minority class and generate synthetic URLs that can be made part of the training set. We crawl a crowd-sourced URL repository to collect recently discovered phishy and benign URLs. Our experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements after using the proposed oversampling technique.

Recently, deep learning techniques have shown new ways of obtaining useful feature representation that provide state of the art results in image and speech processing applications. This paper first presents a brief survey of traditional handcrafted features and later presents a short analysis of handcrafted features v/s features learned by deep neural networks (DNN), for doing fault diagnosis. The DNN based features in this paper were generated in 3 phases: 1) extracted handcrafted features using traditional techniques 2) initialized the weights of DNN by learning de-noising sparse auto-encoders with the handcrafted features in unsupervised fashion and 3) applied two generic fine tuning heuristics that tailor DNN's weights to give good classification performance. The experimentation and analysis were performed on 5 datasets: one each on Air compressor monitoring, Drill bit monitoring and Steel plate monitoring, and two on bearing fault monitoring data.

Our study is located at the most eastern Chinese wintering site in Cangzhou, Hebei Province, where approximately 100 individuals are concentrated in a small area (17.53 km2). Solid information is still lacking about the wintering areas for this subspecies in its eastern range and specifically for China. The study area consists of intensely used farmland in proximity to humans and is lacking conservation areas and wild, open fields. Here, we present our results from two years of field data collection on habitat selection. We choose a machine learning model approach based on a rapid assessment methodology for the winter habitat of the Great Bustard. It is based on a spatial analysis of the best available environmental data, which were collected relatively quickly. These relatively new methods in ecology are based on an ensemble of decision trees and include algorithms such as TreeNet, Random Forest and CART used in parallel. In this study, we collected bustard droppings (presence only) from 48 locations between December 2011 and January 2012 and used the sites as training data. Droppings from 23 locations were collected in November 2012, and those sites were used as test data. We used eight environmental variables as predictor layers for the response variable of bustard presence/availability. We employed a Geographic Information System (ArcGIS 10.1 and Geospatial Modelling Environment) and Google Earth. Compared with the other three models, we found that predictions from Random Forest obtained a significant difference between presence and absence. According to this model, the three most important factors for wintering Great Bustards are distance to residential area, distance to water pools, and farmland area. Our model shows that wintering Great Bustards prefer locations that are over 400 m away from residential areas, within 900 m of water pools and on areas of farmland smaller than 0.5 km2. We think we can apply our analysis to Great Bustard management in our study area and the adjacent region and that this work sets a baseline for future research.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11434-014-0445-9", "venue": null, "journal": "Chinese Science Bulletin", "mag_id": "2118462213", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["135230623", "67800246"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:96706868"}

Traditionally GAN is mainly applied to images, and it becomes more challenging for numeric datasets. In this paper, we propose a histogram-based GAN model ( H i s -GAN). The purpose of our proposed model is to help GAN produce generated data with high quality. Specifically, we map generated data and original data into a histogram, then we count probability percentile on each bin and calculate dissimilarity with traditional f-divergence measures (e.g., Hellinger distance, Jensen\u2013Shannon divergence) and Histogram Intersection Kernel. After that, we incorporate this dissimilarity score into training of the GAN model to update the generator\u2019s parameters to improve generated data quality. This is because the parameters have an influence on the generated data quality. Moreover, we revised GAN training process by feeding GAN model with one group of samples (these samples can come from one class or one cluster that hold similar characteristics) each time, so the final generated data could contain the characteristics from a single group to overcome the challenge of figuring out complex characteristics from mixed groups/clusters of data. In this way, we can generate data that is more indistinguishable from original data.

The genetic algorithm acts as an innovation discovery component which is responsible for discovering new better path planning rules.

Design optimization automatically modifies important design parameters to obtain the best product that satisfies all the design requirements. This thesis explores the use of Support Vector Regression (SVR) and demonstrates its usefulness in the numerical optimization of a low-speed wind turbine for the power coefficient, Cp. The optimization design problem is the three-dimensional optimization of a wind turbine blade by making use of four two-dimensional radial stations. The candidate airfoils at these stations are selected from the 4-digit NACA range. A metamodel of the lift and drag coefficients of the NACA 4-digit series is created with SVR by using training points evaluated with XFOIL software. These SVR approximations are used in conjunction with the Blade Element Momentum theory to calculate and optimize the Cp value for the entire blade. The high accuracy attained with the SVR metamodels makes it a viable alternative to using XFOIL directly, as it has the advantages of being faster and easier to couple with the optimizer. The technique developed allows the optimization procedure the freedom to select profiles, angles of attack and chord length from the 4-digit NACA series to find an optimal Cp value. As a result of every radial blade station consisting of a NACA 4-digit series, the same lift and drag metamodels are used for each station. This technique also makes it simple to evaluate the entire blade as one set of design variables.

Then the cluster head trains the model of the constrained extreme learning machine (CELM) using the measurements of its neighbors to obtain the prediction data of the target sensor. In the calibrating phase, we track and correct the data drift of target sensor using Kalman filter. To evaluate the performance of CELM-KF, simulation experiments on different datasets are conducted, and two parameters including decision coefficient and mean square error (MSE) of CELM-KF are compared with those of existing algorithms. The simulation results show that CELM-KF can successfully calibrate the sensor data drifts.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2949878", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2982693506", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["18479344", "4904848", "18679327", "10726215", "3899799", "71150063", "85500002", "86472352", "32806582", "1711061", "85525145", "7427112", "1914348", "69975408", "67882495", "9119958", "2247634", "18402390", "35788709", "16566057", "152735", "17750576", "2431917", "8154823", "108108197", "34858624", "16103131", "65313245", "31005252", "116858", "31316053"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208125618"}

The paper compares the performance and effectiveness of the PSSs in damping the electromechanical modes. In evaluating the different methods, an eigenvalue based objective function was used in the design of the PSSs whereby the algorithm maximizes the lowest damping ratio over specified operating conditions. Eigenvalue analysis and time domain simulations show that the systems equipped with BGA-PSS and PBIL - PSS perform very closely.

Urbanization progress that occurs due to population expansion and migration results in important changes in the land cover characteristics of a city. These changes mostly affect natural habitats and the ecosystem in a negative manner. Hence, urbanization-related changes should be monitored regularly, and land cover maps should be updated to reflect the current situation. This research presents a comparative evaluation of two classification algorithms, pixel-based support vector machine (SVM) classification and decision-tree-oriented geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) classification, in producing a dynamic land cover map of the Istanbul metropolitan city in Turkey between 2013 and 2017 using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) multi-temporal satellite images. Additionally, the efficiencies of the two data dimension reduction methods are evaluated as part of this research. For dimension reduction, built-up index (BUI) and principal component analysis (PCA) data were calculated for five images during the mentioned period, and the classification algorithms were applied on data stacks for each dimension reduction method. The classification results indicate that the GEOBIA classification of the BUI data set provided the highest accuracy, with a 91.60% overall accuracy and 0.91 kappa value. This combination was followed by the GEOBIA classification of the PCA data set, which highlights the overall efficiency of the GEOBIA over the SVM method. On the other hand, the BUI data set provided more reliable and consistent results for urban expansion classes due to representing physical responses of the surface when compared to the data set of the PCA, which is a spectral transformation method.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/ijgi8030139", "venue": "ISPRS Int.

In this work, we propose a simple yet effective regularization term to address the mode collapse issue for cGANs.

This mode seeking regularization term is readily applicable to various conditional generation tasks without imposing training overhead or modifying the original network structures.

Specifically, the overlapping class boundaries of a fuzzy model are similar to the transitions between different environmental conditions. However, the need for ecological expert knowledge is an important constraint when applying fuzzy species distribution models. Moreover, the consistency of the ecological preferences of some fish species across different rivers has been widely contested. Recent research has shown that data-driven fuzzy models may solve this 'knowledge acquisition bottleneck' and this paper is a further contribution. The aim was to analyse the brown trout (Salmo trutta fario L.) habitat preferences based on a data-driven fuzzy modelling technique and to compare the resulting fuzzy models with a commonly applied modelling technique, Random Forests. A heuristic nearest ascent hill-climbing algorithm for fuzzy rule optimisation and Random Forests were applied to analyse the ecological preferences of brown trout in 93 mesohabitats. No significant differences in model performance were observed between the optimal fuzzy model and the Random Forests model and both approaches selected river width, the cover index and flow velocity as the most important variables describing brown trout habitat suitability. Further, the fuzzy model combined ecological relevance with reasonable interpretability, whereas the transparency of the Random Forests model was limited. This paper shows that fuzzy models may be a valid approach for species distribution modelling and that their performance is comparable to that of state-of-the-art modelling techniques like Random Forests.

Unfortunately, the number of SNPs is very large and it is costly to sequence many individuals. Therefore, it is desirable to reduce the number of SNPs that should be sequenced to a small number of informative representatives called tag SNPs. Depending on the application, tagging can achieve either budget savings by inferring non-tag SNPs from tag SNPs or shortening lengthy and difficult to handle SNP sequences obtained from Affimetrix Map Array. Tagging should first choose which SNPs to use as tags and then predict the unknown non-tag SNPs from the known tags. In this paper we propose a new SNP prediction using a robust tool for classification - Support Vector Machine (SVM). For tag selection we use a fast stepwise tag selection algorithm. An extensive experimental study on various datasets including 3 regions from HapMap shows that the tag selection based on SVM SNP prediction can reach the same prediction accuracy as the methods of Halldorson et al. (7) on the LPL using significantly fewer tags. For example, our method reaches 90% SNP prediction accuracy using only 3 tags for Daly et al. (6) dataset with 103 SNPs.

By setting different scanning parameters, each MR imaging modality reflects the unique visual characteristic of scanned body part, benefiting the subsequent analysis from multiple perspectives. To utilize the complementary information from multiple imaging modalities, cross-modality MR image synthesis has aroused increasing research interest recently. However, most existing methods only focus on minimizing pixel/voxel-wise intensity difference but ignore the textural details of image content structure, which affects the quality of synthesized images. In this paper, we propose edge-aware generative adversarial networks (Ea-GANs) for cross-modality MR image synthesis. Specifically, we integrate edge information, which reflects the textural structure of image content and depicts the boundaries of different objects in images, to reduce this gap. Corresponding to different learning strategies, two frameworks are proposed, i.e., a generator-induced Ea-GAN (gEa-GAN) and a discriminator-induced Ea-GAN (dEa-GAN). The gEa-GAN incorporates the edge information via its generator, while the dEa-GAN further does this from both the generator and the discriminator so that the edge similarity is also adversarially learned. In addition, the proposed Ea-GANs are 3D-based and utilize hierarchical features to capture contextual information. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Ea-GANs, especially the dEa-GAN, outperform multiple state-of-the-art methods for cross-modality MR image synthesis in both qualitative and quantitative measures. Moreover, the dEa-GAN also shows excellent generality to generic image synthesis tasks on benchmark datasets about facades, maps, and cityscapes.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30714911", "doi": "10.1109/TMI.2019.2895894", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2914057844", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["19554954", "21194292", "54467617", "247457", "148067", "3699622", "11867508", "4927286", "5797321", "1906533", "4238148", "15261328", "17446250", "6628577", "2609021", "6758477", "3611582", "206594692", "56507745", "3719281", "2164893", "85524843", "35639092", "12803511", "6200260", "206770979", "3847983", "51628313", "30962846", "3397048", "3954780", "20894582", "4881460", "44108413", "3655281", "37914145", "207408905", "10853534", "43939347", "13256186", "21282813", "51614024", "2119244", "31864609", "8601838", "7663150", "1033682", "51610791", "206429151", "1687220", "5216145", "1739295", "207761262", "3690780", "3564179", "53944116", "6060524", "502946"], "inbound_citations": ["208157892", "209444622", "209495427", "139104274", "202750137", "211082884"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:73440963"}

Each aspect can thought of as a different type of observation for the same schedule While existing label propagation approaches can exploit vast amounts of unlabeled data, they cannot handle multi-aspect data.

To mitigate the threat, a lot of recent studies use machine learning techniques to classify Twitter spam and report very satisfactory results. However, most of the studies overlook a fundamental issue that is widely seen in real-world Twitter data, i.e., the class imbalance problem. In this paper, we show that the unequal distribution between spam and non-spam classes in the data has a great impact on spam detection rate. To address the problem, we propose an ensemble learning approach, which involves three steps. In the first step, we adjust the class distribution in the imbalanced data set using various strategies, including random oversampling, random undersampling and fuzzy-based oversampling. In the next step, a classification model is built upon each of the redistributed data sets. In the final step, a majority voting scheme is introduced to combine all the classification models.

Existing methods rely heavily on manual extraction of PVC beats, which limits their application to the automatic PVC recognition from long-term data recorded by ECG monitors before and during operation. Besides, researches identifying PVC sources in the whole ventricle have not been reported. ::: ::: ::: OBJECTIVE ::: The purpose of this study was to validate the feasibility of localization of origins of PVC in the whole ventricle and to explore an automatic algorithm for recognition of PVC beat based on long-term 12-lead ECG. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: This study included 249 patients with spontaneous PVCs or pacing-induced PVCs. A novel algorithm was used to automatically extract PVC beats from massive original ECG data which were collected by different acquisition devices. After clustering and labelling, 374 sample groups, with each containing dozens to hundreds of PVC beats, formed the entire dataset of 11 categories which correspond to 11 regions of PVC origins in the whole ventricle. To choose the best classification model for current task, four machine learning methods, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and Gaussian Nav\u00efe Bayes (GNB), were compared by randomly selecting 70% of the entire dataset (sample groups = 257) for training and the remaining 30% (sample groups = 117) for testing. The average performance of each model was estimated by bootstrap method using 1000 resampling trials. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: For PVC beat recognition, the achieved testing accuracy, sensitivity and specificity is 97.6%, 98.3% and 96.7%, respectively. For localization purpose, the achieved testing accuracy varies slightly from 70.7% to 74.1% among four classifiers, and when neighboring regions were combined, the testing rank accuracy is improved to a range of 91.5% to 93.2%. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: The proposed algorithm can automatically recognize PVC beats and map them to one of the 11 regions in the whole ventricle. Owing to the high accuracy of PVC beat recognition and the capability to target the potential PVC origins in multi regions, it is expected to be a predominant technique being used in clinical settings to automatically analyze huge ECG data before and during operation so as to replace the tedious manual identification.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "32252035", "doi": "10.1088/1361-6579/ab86d7", "venue": "Physiological measurement", "journal": "Physiological measurement", "mag_id": "3015001108", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:215405012"}

However, to the best of our knowledge, research on utilizing those mutual relationships has not been reported. In this paper, we propose a novel super-graph model SG=(MG,AG) $SG=(MG,AG)$, where MG denotes a multi-graph and AG represents a graph (named abstract-graph), that describes the mutual relationships among the graphs contained in MG. The super-graph classification problem is challenging to solve because of the very complex structure of the super-graph model. Furthermore, it is hard to directly select distinguished subgraphs, i.e., subgraph features, from super-graphs. A subgraph g of graph G is a graph that is isomorphic with one of the substructures of G. Moreover, the practical applications require the super-graph classification algorithm to have high precision. In this paper, we propose a concept and algorithm for selecting composite subgraph features, based on which a framework is proposed to solve the super-graph classification problem. Subgraph features denote subgraphs that can be used to distinguish super-graphs with different class labels. We first design a two-step approach to select k composite subgraph features from the subgraphs of super-graphs\u2019 abstract-graphs and multi-graphs. Then, based on composite features and the subgraph feature representation of a super-graph, each super-graph SG is transformed into a 0-1 vector with k dimensions. If there exists a substructure in SG that is isomorphic with its i th composite feature, the i th component of the target vector is set to 1 (1 \u2264 i \u2264 k). Otherwise, it is set to 0. Based on the derived k-dimensional vectors, one of the existing classification algorithms is used to construct a prediction model to predict the class labels of the unseen super-graphs, such as naive Bayes or support vector machine (SVM). Specifically, we adapt the extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm to further improve the accuracy of super-graph classification. In this paper, we propose a super-graph model and study the problem of super-graph classification. We first derive the concept of composite subgraph features that are selected by our proposed two-step method. Based on the mined composite subgraph features, we propose a super-graph classification framework (SGC) to solve the super-graph classification problem. Moreover, ELM can be used to further improve the classification accuracy.

Many approaches on concept drift detection either assume full availability of data labels, y or handle only the virtual drift. In a streaming environment, the assumption of full availability of data labels, y is questioned. On the other hand, approaches that deal with virtual drift failed to address real drift. Rather than improving the state-of-the-art methods, this paper presents a semi-supervised framework to deal with the challenges above. The objective of the proposed framework is to learn from streaming environment with limited data labels, y and detect real drift concurrently. This paper proposes a novel concept drift detection method utilizing the densities of posterior probabilities in partially labeled streaming environments.

Here, we present a new deep-learning approach, called HoloStain, which converts images of isolated biological cells acquired without staining by holographic microscopy to their virtually stained images. We demonstrate this approach for human sperm cells, as there is a well-established protocol and global standardization for characterizing the morphology of stained human sperm cells for fertility evaluation, but, on the other hand, staining might be cytotoxic and thus is not allowed during human in vitro fertilization (IVF). We use deep convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) with training that is based on both the quantitative phase images and two gradient phase images, all extracted from the digital holograms of the stain-free cells, with the ground truth of bright-field images of the same cells that subsequently underwent chemical staining. To validate the quality of our virtual staining approach, an experienced embryologist analyzed the unstained cells, the virtually stained cells, and the chemically stained sperm cells several times in a blinded and randomized manner. We obtained a 5-fold recall (sensitivity) improvement in the analysis results.

The general principle behind the remote sensing retrieval of PM2.5 is to first retrieve the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and calculate the PM2.5 via the AOD-based statistical relationships. This method is likely to cause error propagation, which leads to instability in the retrieval model. In this paper, we propose a PM2.5 remote sensing retrieval method via an ensemble random forest machine learning method to directly establish the relationship between the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) images and ground observational PM2.5 to avoid retrieval errors from the atmospheric aerosol optical depths and obtain PM2.5 retrieval results with higher precision and spatial resolution. The proposed method first uses a random forest to train and validate the MODIS images and ground observation station PM2.5 data; then, an optimal multi-model group, according to the determination coefficient R-square (R ::: 2 ::: ) index, is selected. Finally, the optimal multi-model group is used on the whole MODIS image to obtain the PM2.5 retrieval result for the whole area. In an attempt to use machine learning technology to retrieve PM2.5, the experiments selected a substantial amount of MODIS image data during four seasons in Guangdong Province for validation and compared three performance indicators (R ::: 2 ::: , RMSE, and correlation coefficient (CC) to verify the superiority of the proposed algorithm.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2908975", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2928066036", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["128949132", "38594826", "507516", "140572697", "52083458", "129658238", "16745673", "8563821", "5909957", "18014753", "8118893", "129649013", "33168922", "42120812", "23457471", "9362608", "60442897", "125278822", "52243042", "55000106", "13666676", "125314358", "10829801", "49313106"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:117738890"}

Currently, different neural networks have been put forward in the field of traffic congestion prediction and have been put to extensive use.

Accordingly, this inhibits the large-scale application of traffic prediction. On the basis of the theory of the extreme learning machine (ELM), the current paper puts forward a symmetric-ELM-cluster (S-ELM-Cluster) fast learning methodology. In this suggested methodology, the complex learning issue of large-scale data is transformed into different issues on small- and medium-scale data sets.

Together, this methodology fully exploits the benefits associated with the ELM algorithm in terms of accuracy over smaller subsets, high training speed, fewer parameters, and easy parallel acceleration for the realization of high-accuracy and high-efficiency large-scale traffic congestion data learning.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/sym11060730", "venue": "Symmetry", "journal": "Symmetry", "mag_id": "2946953362", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["207959975", "208781193"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:191148416"}

The learning of finite-state languages (FSL) from example strings is a domain which has been extensively studied and might provide an opportunity to help understand connectionist learning. A major problem is that traditional FSL learning assumes the storage of all examples and thus violates connectionist principles. This paper presents a provably correct algorithm for inferring any minimum-state deterministic finite-state automata (FSA) from a complete ordered sample using limited total storage and without storing example strings. The algorithm is an iterative strategy that uses at each stage a current encoding of the data considered so far, and one single sample string. One of the crucial advantages of our algorithm is that the total amount of space used in the course of learning for encoding any finite prefix of the sample is polynomial in the size of the inferred minimum state deterministic FSA. The algorithm is also relatively efficient in time and has been implemented. More importantly, there is a connectionist version of the algorithm that preserves these properties. The connectionist version requires much more structure than the usual models and has been implemented using the Rochester Connectionist Simulator. We also show that no machine with finite working storage can iteratively identify the FSL from arbitrary presentations.", "year": 1988, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4615-4008-3_2", "venue": "COLT 1988", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2044136839", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["57215759", "18655618", "17473878", "5803971", "1037779", "2292900", "14286652", "18855606", "6148972", "14250037", "9852786", "16614691", "11893119", "14901089", "14117587", "12296506", "10156846", "14144850", "16685867", "118702508", "3074461", "53459671", "7684777", "23122378", "11746490", "16397159", "195608453", "9379037", "62729724", "13367857", "14190699", "6707408", "5744836", "2397878", "15273694", "73547539", "49545640", "19113357", "30039169", "17217204", "10047570", "22644751", "2798755", "8173252", "17481163", "532946", "9451310", "14386343", "17947485", "10663433"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195708098"}

However, the ability of these models to disentangle often decreases as the complexity of the generative factors increases. In this paper, we investigate the little-explored effect of the modeling capacity of a posterior density on the disentangling ability of the VAE. We note that the independence within and the complexity of the latent density are two different properties we constrain when regularizing the posterior density: while the former promotes the disentangling ability of VAE, the latter - if overly limited - creates an unnecessary competition with the data reconstruction objective in VAE. Therefore, if we preserve the independence but allow richer modeling capacity in the posterior density, we will lift this competition and thereby allow improved independence and data reconstruction at the same time. We investigate this theoretical intuition with a VAE that utilizes a non-parametric latent factor model, the Indian Buffet Process (IBP), as a latent density that is able to grow with the complexity of the data. Across two widely-used benchmark data sets (MNIST and dSprites) and two clinical data sets little explored for disentangled learning, we qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrated the improved disentangling performance of IBP-VAE over the state of the art. In the latter two clinical data sets riddled with complex factors of variations, we further demonstrated that unsupervised disentangling of nuisance factors via IBP-VAE - when combined with a supervised objective - can not only improve task accuracy in comparison to relevant supervised deep architectures, but also facilitate knowledge discovery related to task decision-making.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1909.01839", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICDM.2019.00127", "venue": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)", "journal": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2972264839,3003707492", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["46798026", "3638140", "3380833", "20827927", "5002792", "16895865", "3523097", "9768803", "14542261", "10768153", "18730531", "26884910", "202539801", "1033682", "3289726", "1327363", "15534684", "52086172", "2042076", "4542665", "52952537", "490669", "126185347", "2428314", "14307651"], "inbound_citations": ["204874971", "202539801"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202539801"}

Field data including soil salinity in the sugarcane root zone was collected at 191 locations in 25 fields during September 2010. In the first section of the paper, based on the yield potential of sugarcane as influenced by different soil salinity levels provided by FAO, soil salinity was classified into three classes, low salinity (1.7\u20133.4 dS/m), moderate salinity (3.5\u20135.9 dS/m) and high salinity (6\u20139.5) by applying different classification methods including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), Minimum Distance (MD) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) on Hyperion and Landsat images.

Different training methods, model characteristics and features selection criteria have been compared. ::: ::: Potential applications of this research include the design of adaptive IVIS and of \u201csmarter\u201d Partially Autonomous Driving Assistance Systems (PADAS), as well as the evaluation of driver's distraction.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ECAI", "journal": null, "mag_id": "1548286920", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["396764", "202540506", "2731584", "36835333", "15416758", "18065563", "61808033", "3330919", "26604421"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:33352345"}

Given appropriate training data, a Support Vector Machine statistically reproduces the results of non-linear inversion. Inversion of the non-linear Zoeppritz equations is an illposed problem. The results of an inversion depend heavily on the a priori assumptions used to regularize it. If an SVM is trained using data that contains the same assumptions, it will get the same answer. It captures nonlinear relationships as easily as linear ones by employing a kernel function. A naive SVM can usually be trained using fewer calculations of a forward model than are necessary in an equally naive inversion.

This paper presents a practical solution, which can be readily deployed, by considering various real-life issues. Load forecasting algorithms are developed using Non-linear AutoRegressive model with eXogenous input (NARX) neural network and Support Vector Regression (SVR) to forecast the power consumption for day ahead, week ahead and month ahead at 15 minute granularity. Missing values, outliers in the power consumption data are treated using simple but effective techniques based on the thorough understanding of the power consumption time-series data. Autoregressive features, temperature and some efficacious contextual information, which are completely pertinent to this problem, are being derived to model this heterogeneous time series that consists of disparate patterns on weekdays, weekends and holidays. The novelty of the solution lies in the fact that it extensively models all the variations and produces accurate long term predictions at high granularity (15 min). The algorithms are validated using the actual power consumption data from three Office buildings; forecasting accuracy of both SVR and NARX neural network are comparable, the latter performs better by a thin margin.

To facilitate short-term age synthesis, we further propose label distribution-guided generative adversarial network (ldGAN), where each sample is associated with an age label distribution (ALD) rather than a single age group. Accordingly, each sample can contribute not only to the learning of its own age group but also to neighbouring groups\u2019 learning. This is useful when addressing short-term aging to cope with the reduced amount of training data. In addition, unlike one-hot encoding which treats age groups as independent from one another, ldGAN can well capture the correlation among different age groups, so that smooth aging sequences can be achieved. The ALD model is integrated into GAN with a two-step process. Firstly, instead of the traditional one-hot encoding, ALD is applied as the condition of the generator. Secondly, we add a sequence of label distribution learners on top of several multi-scale discriminators, with the aim of minimizing the label distribution learning loss when optimizing both the generator and discriminators. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations are conducted to assess ldGAN\u2019s ability in dealing with two core issues of face aging, i.e., aging effect generation and identity preservation. The obtained experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ldGAN in both learning short-term aging patterns and coping with the lack of training data.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TIFS.2020.2975921", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3007646528", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["43628594", "1241203", "15822910", "20282277", "1153569", "18592845", "26403327", "36184486", "22556429", "701970", "11632904", "19956421", "206592400", "15970160", "2825965", "5727461", "14323451", "3465604", "3628759", "810708", "3565237", "51994554", "56895281", "21440926", "1033682", "12803511", "52935324", "5002792", "2057420", "10894094", "206771128", "21011865", "42092779", "9417016", "50769652", "7684482", "1428032", "7600274", "980236", "206770979", "41805341", "31281854", "9442999", "14911023"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212705697"}

These models are motivated by their ease of development, high computational learning speed and relatively good results. Alternatively, constructive models that select the hidden-layer weights as a subset of the data have shown superior performance than random-based ones in some cases. In this work, we present a comparison between original ELMs (i.e., ELMs where the hidden-layer weights are selected randomly, that we will call ELM-Random) and a modified version of ELMs where the hidden-layer weights are a subset of the input data (that we will call ELM-Input). We will focus our comparison on the behavior of both strategies for different sizes of the training set and different network sizes. The results on several benchmark data sets for classification problems show that ELM-Input has superior performance than ELM-Random in some cases and similar in the rest. In some cases, this general trend is observed for all sizes of the training set and all network sizes. In other cases, it is mostly observed when the size of the training set is small. Therefore, the strategy of selecting the hidden-layer weights among the data can be considered as a good alternative or complement to the standard random selection for ELMs.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IJCNN.2017.7966043", "venue": "2017 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)", "journal": "2017 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2734535818", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["62245742", "59827025", "117948443", "116858", "61610957", "19445927", "16487144", "9270605", "5985333", "7727977", "18638122", "17292559", "7964761", "7138354", "12132619", "1830773", "12755946", "635708", "2516904", "15037168", "59849738", "36198911", "14997477", "29547330"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2546788"}

Contrary to Boosted Trees, in our method the loss minimization is an inherent part of the tree growing process, thus allowing to keep the benefits of common Random Forests, such as, parallel processing. We derive the new classifier and give a discussion and evaluation on standard machine learning data sets. Furthermore, we show how ADFs can be easily integrated into an object detection application.

Previous works leveraging RNNs for action recognition mainly apply LSTM on the top of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), feeding high level semantic feature to RNNs and neglecting to learn spatiotemporal features in video, which makes the models unable to capture complex action patterns and lead to inferior performance. In this work, instead of adopting RNNs as classifiers, we propose to learn spatiotemporal feature in a recurrent way by replacing intermediate convolutional layers in CNNs with recurrent layers to model spatiotemporal information. In order to learn discriminative spatiotemporal features, we extend the bottleneck structure of Residual Network (ResNet) to model the spatiotemporal information in action video. To fully utilize the pretrained CNN model, we also introduce approaches to transfer the weight of original convolutional layer to our proposed model.

Ability to detect these symptoms heavily relies on accurate measurements of emotion and its components, such as emotional valence comprising of positive, negative and neutral affect. Speech as a bio-signal to measure valence is interesting because of the ubiquity of smartphones that can easily record and process speech signals. Speech-based emotion detection uses a broad spectrum of features derived from audio samples including pitch, energy, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Linear Predictive Cepstral Coefficients, Log frequency power coefficients, spectrograms and so on. Despite the array of features and classifiers, detecting valence from speech alone remains a challenge. Further, the algorithms for extracting some of these features are computeintensive. This becomes a problem particularly in smartphone applications where the algorithms have to be executed on the device itself. We propose a novel time-domain feature that not only improves the valence detection accuracy, but also saves 10% of the computational cost of extraction as compared to that of MFCCs.

Monitoring city-wide mobile traffic is however a complex and costly process that relies on dedicated probes. Some of these probes have limited precision or coverage, others gather tens of gigabytes of logs daily, which independently offer limited insights. Extracting fine-grained patterns involves expensive spatial aggregation of measurements, storage, and post-processing. In this paper, we propose a mobile traffic super-resolution technique that overcomes these problems by inferring narrowly localised traffic consumption from coarse measurements. We draw inspiration from image processing and design a deep-learning architecture tailored to mobile networking, which combines Zipper Network (ZipNet) and Generative Adversarial neural Network (GAN) models. This enables to uniquely capture spatio-temporal relations between traffic volume snapshots routinely monitored over broad coverage areas (`low-resolution') and the corresponding consumption at 0.05 km $^2$ level (`high-resolution') usually obtained after intensive computation. Experiments we conduct with a real-world data set demonstrate that the proposed ZipNet(-GAN) infers traffic consumption with remarkable accuracy and up to 100$\\times$ higher granularity as compared to standard probing, while outperforming existing data interpolation techniques. To our knowledge, this is the first time super-resolution concepts are applied to large-scale mobile traffic analysis and our solution is the first to infer fine-grained urban traffic patterns from coarse aggregates.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1711.02413", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3143361.3143393", "venue": "CoNEXT '17", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2952345260,2767289262", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["741071", "16136948", "18695828", "14888420", "6593498", "35258007", "206594692", "1033682", "623137", "1923924", "5808102", "715122", "9433631", "14124313", "211227", "18828233", "6628106", "14291317", "8187730", "9751499", "123118384", "9506273", "14099741", "13871824", "14935890", "206769988"], "inbound_citations": ["162184492", "210911878", "50771564", "212637059", "196622537", "169035129", "67864862", "106410733", "182281346", "4494858", "204837895", "207757903", "198968152", "52902763", "70135417"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:423181"}

In this research article, we tried to study, from a machine learning perspective, the performance of several machine learning classifiers that use heterogenous features based on biochemical and biophysical properties of amino acids to discriminate between amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic regions in peptides. Four conventional machine learning classifiers namely Support Vector Machine, Neural network, Decision tree and Random forest were trained and tested to find the best classifier that fits the problem domain well. Prior to classification, novel implementations of two biologically-inspired feature optimization techniques based on evolutionary algorithms and methodologies that mimic social life and a multivariate method based on projection are utilized in order to remove the unimportant and uninformative features. Among the dimenionality reduction algorithms considered under the study, prediction results show that algorithms based on evolutionary computation is the most effective.

This paper proposes a novel approach for the accurate segmentation and classification of the brain tumor from MR images. Initially, the tumor image is pre-processed with the anisotropic diffusion filter then a region based active contour is used to detect the tumor. Active Contour Model (ACM) will provide smooth and close contours and can achieve high accuracy.In the classification process, various features are extracted from the tumor images using the 2-D Daubechies DWT. The feature vector dimensions are reduced using Independent Component Analysis (ICA). A trained Support Vector Machine with different kernels which can be treated as KSVM is used for the classification of the tumor.

We apply this approach to the case of AUC, the Area Under the ROC curve, and define Buffered AUC (bAUC). We show that bAUC can provide insights into classifier performance not revealed by AUC, while being closely related as the tightest concave lower bound and representable as the area under a modified ROC curve. Additionally, while AUC is numerically difficult to optimize directly, we show that bAUC optimization often reduces to convex or linear programming. Extending these results, we show that AUC and bAUC are special cases of Generalized bAUC and that popular Support Vector Machine (SVM) formulations for approximately maximizing AUC are equivalent to direct maximization of Generalized bAUC. We also prove bAUC generalization bounds for these SVM\u2019s.

Based on the well-trained Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) and Neural Networks (NN) models of energy consumption, ambient air temperature and air velocity which have earlier been established and validated through experimental studies, our current optimization problem is formulated to associate indoor thermal comfort with energy efficiency of buildings, so that we can evaluate the key parameters that will influence the balancing of these two demands. The optimizations of the objective functions are carried out in real-time by using novel techniques of sparse AFA. We examined six different schemes of AFA, which are different in random-wandering size and random-wandering distribution. This is so that small and large regions with different wandering can be comprehensively studied. Moreover, the Energy Saving Rates (ESRs) of different operating frequencies are predicted through a third order polynomial regression to minimize the Mean Squared Errors (MSE) of the cost functions. Evaluations of the six different schemes show that the scheme named Large Region Gaussian Wandering (LRGW) generally outperforms the others. Given the best experimental results of AFA optimizations and demonstrated through an experimental room, the maximum potential ESR are about \u221226.5% for Case 1 of general offices and \u22129.83% for Case 2 of lecture theatres/conference rooms.

Simulation of the knee torque was modelled via Support Vector Regression (SVR) due to its good generalization ability in related fields. Inputs to the proposed model were MMG amplitude characteristics, the level of electrical stimulation or contraction intensity, and knee angle. Gaussian kernel function, as well as its optimal parameters were identified with the best performance measure and were applied as the SVR kernel function to build an effective knee torque estimation model. To train and test the model, the data were partitioned into training (70%) and testing (30%) subsets, respectively. The SVR estimation accuracy, based on the coefficient of determination (R\u00b2) between the actual and the estimated torque values was up to 94% and 89% during the training and testing cases, with root mean square errors (RMSE) of 9.48 and 12.95, respectively.

While turbidity itself does not directly present a hazard to human health, it can be an indication of poor water quality and mask the presence of parasites such as Cryptosporidium. It is, therefore, a recommendation of the World Health Organisation (WHO) that turbidity should not exceed a level of 1 Nephelometric Turbidity Unit (NTU) before chlorination. For a drinking water supplier, turbidity peaks can be highly disruptive requiring the temporary shutdown of a water treatment works. Such events must be carefully managed to ensure continued supply; to recover the supply deficit, water stores must be depleted or alternative works utilised. Machine learning techniques have been shown to be effective for the modelling of complex environmental systems, often used to help shape environmental policy. We contribute to the literature by adopting such techniques for operational purposes, developing a decision support tool that predicts >1 NTU turbidity events up to seven days in advance allowing water supply managers to make proactive interventions. We apply a Generalised Linear Model (GLM) and a Random Forest (RF) model for the prediction of >1 NTU events. AUROC scores of over 0.80 at five of six sites suggest that machine learning techniques are suitable for predicting turbidity peaking events.

The core of existing cross-modal retrieval approaches is to narrow down the gap between different modalities either by finding a maximally correlated embedding space. Recently, researchers leverage Deep Neural Network (DNN) to learn nonlinear transformations for each modality to obtain transformed features in a common subspace where cross-modal matching can be performed. However, the statistical characteristics of the original features for each modality are not explicitly preserved in the learned subspace. Inspired by recent advances in adversarial learning, we propose a novel Deep Adversarial Metric Learning approach, termed DAML for cross-modal retrieval. DAML nonlinearly maps labeled data pairs of different modalities into a shared latent feature subspace, under which the intra-class variation is minimized and the inter-class variation is maximized, and the difference of each data pair captured from two modalities of the same class is minimized, respectively. In addition to maximizing the correlations between modalities, we add an additional regularization by introducing adversarial learning. In particular, we introduce a modality classifier to predict the modality of a transformed feature, which ensures that the transformed features are also statistically indistinguishable. Experiments on three popular multimodal datasets show that DAML achieves superior performance compared to several state of the art cross-modal retrieval methods.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11280-018-0541-x", "venue": "World Wide Web", "journal": "World Wide Web", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2795389793", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2495132", "206662107", "6483070", "207216960", "6755881", "1560943", "1033682", "2066599", "202473", "30227854", "15772353", "8785311", "11072034", "16594465", "352650", "14061443", "11758569", "5583509", "10347107", "7166661", "17166610", "14124313", "207202940", "3633912", "3670618", "686835", "710430", "31677534", "3693305", "5063278", "14137253", "15361180", "16741401", "3438487", "9599916", "37986862", "19015689", "13601378", "17901035", "14932020", "11015076", "11333098", "6783548", "17437807", "5942627", "26488999"], "inbound_citations": ["53039664", "203145679", "58004836", "47020689", "53733125", "52153004", "52964482", "57427507", "57426998", "52822087", "133604016", "211297689", "57427337", "199509174", "199018879", "52047653", "86621539", "198324724", "56177098", "58019921", "86832326", "53086684", "209497514", "208157975", "214743601", "201065793", "56718990", "208112043", "169032532", "199543452", "210972034", "201651618", "67771153"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4560834"}

We made Lushan and its surrounding areas as our study area, which suffered from the earthquake in April 20, 2013. This area is located in fault zone in the Longmen Mountains, it shows guiding significance for the study of seismic landslide in southwest China. Based on seismic landslide physical mechanics, we chose slope, aspect, fault, river, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), waviness, lithology, seismic intensity and elevation as landslide factors.

When the number of sample data is greater than 50, the OOB generalization error result is less than 0.08, and the area under the ROC curve was 0.938 which means the model has a high reliability.

In recent work an Inductive Logic Programming approach called Logical Vision (LV) was shown to overcome some of these limitations. LV uses Meta-Interpretive Learning combined with low-level extraction of high-contrast points sampled from the image to learn recursive logic programs describing the image. This paper extends LV by using (a) richer background knowledge enabling secondary reasoning from raw images, such as light reflection that can itself be learned and used for resolving visual ambiguities, which cannot be easily modelled using statistical approaches, (b) a wider class of background models representing classical 2D shapes such as circles and ellipses, (c) primitive-level statistical estimators to handle noise in real images. Our results indicate that the new noise-robust version of LV is able to handle secondary reasoning task in real images with few data, which is very similar to scientific discovery process of humans. Specifically, it uses a single example (i.e. one-shot LV) converges to an accuracy at least comparable to thirty-shot statistical machine learner on the prediction of hidden light sources.

Though sign language has been developed and deaf people are usually quite adept at lipreading, it can become a very difficult task for varying speakers with different accents and speaking speeds. A lot of models have been proposed to capture the speaker\u2019s lip movements and predicting the sentences spoken by them by observing the movements and contours. This too is a difficult task as a lot of consonants have the same lip movement which leads to the necessity of having sequential models, which take into account the words that have been spoken previously and the words that are spoken afterwards. Speakers\u2019 mouths may additionally look of varying kinds and so might their appearances in images. We propose a model for this purpose. Our LRNeuNet operates using SpatioTemporal Convolutional Neural Network (STCNN), ResNet, Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU), SpatioTemporal Pyramidal Pooling(STPP) and Hybrid Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)/ Attention. The STCNN incorporates Maxout layer. We use STPP to give a fixed-length representation for training by pooling the features in arbitrary regions. In the hidden neural layer, Hybrid CTC/ Attention model partially removes the error of the assumption of conditional independence of CTC.

Routine, yet time-consuming and important tasks can be made more efficient by the application of machine learning-based assisted interpretation, freeing the geoscientist to carry out tasks with greater value. Accuracy, reproducibility, and understanding of uncertainty are also improved and greater insight can be gained. Biostratigraphic data is very common in the industry but requires deep specialised knowledge and significant time to interpret, hence it can be underutilized. However, the form of the data makes it suitable for the application of machine learning techniques. The applications of machine leaning have been tested on biostratigraphic data from a set of typical industry wells to facilitate the interpretation of biozone/age and paleoenvironment. Application of Random Forest and Naive Bayesian algorithms achieved results comparable to standard human interpretation, although pre-processing of the data (e.g. removal of spurious reworked or caved data) proved beneficial. Critical to the success of the project was the close working relationship between data scientists and subject matter experts in order to capture the nuances of biostratigraphic data and its interpretation. The work forms a case study for application to other geoscience data types.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3997/2214-4609.201901606", "venue": "81st EAGE Conference and Exhibition 2019", "journal": "81st EAGE Conference and Exhibition 2019", "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": null, "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202443415"}

Purpose: Manual self-monitoring techniques for diet suffer from drawbacks such as low adherence, underreporting, and recall error [5]-[7]. Camera based applications that automatically extract type and quantity of food from an image of the food plate can potentially improve adherence and accuracy. However, state-of-the-art systems [8] have fairly low accuracy for identifying cooked food (only 63%) and are not fully automatic. To overcome these drawbacks such as low adherence, underreporting, recall error, low accuracy, and semi-automatedness, we introduce MT-Diet, a fully automated diet assessment system. It can identify cooked food with an accuracy of 88.93%. This is a significant improvement (over 20%) from the current state-of-the art system. Method: MT-Diet is a smartphone-based system that interfaces a thermal sensor with a smartphone. Using this system a user can take both thermal and visual images of her food plate with just one click. We used a database of 80 frozen meals which contain several different types of foods so that the actual total number of our food database 244 and the database has 33 different types of foods. By using the database, we demonstrate two core components: a) food segmentation, separating food items from the plate and recognizing multiple food items as a single food item, and b) food identification, determining the type of foods. Result: MT-Diet food segmentation methodology is fully automatic and requires no user input as opposed to recent works, the accuracy of separating food parts from the plate was 97.5%. The accuracy of food identification using Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function kernel based on color, texture, and histogram of oriented gradients features is 88.5%. Conclusion: We suggest a new and novel approach for diet assessment, MT-Diet. Our approach can potentially be an inexpensive, real time for the feedback on calorie intake, easy-to-use, privacy preservation, personalization based on eating habits of individuals, and fully automated diet monitoring system.

We tested the influence of stand composition on defoliation during the first 5 years of a spruce budworm outbreak near Amqui, Quebec, by sampling 27 fir-hardwood plots selected to represent three percent hardwood basal area classes (0%\u201325%, 40%\u201365%, and 75%\u201395%). Balsam fir defoliation was significantly lower (p < 0.001) as hardwood content increased, but the relationship varied with overall defoliation severity each year.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Twin Bridge Transfer Learning (TBT), to address the sparse collaborative filtering problem. TBT reduces the sparsity in target data by transferring knowledge from dense auxiliary data through two paths: 1) the latent factors of users and items learned from two dense auxiliary domains, and 2) the similarity graphs of users and items constructed from the learned latent factors. These two paths act as a twin bridge to allow more knowledge transferred across domains to reduce the sparsity of target data.

These machine learning approaches are often developed for the optimisation of model accuracy which can come at the expense of the interpretation of the prediction. ::: ::: Highly predictive models should be the goal of any modeller, however, the intended users of the model and all factors relating to usage of the model should be considered. One such aspect is the clarity, understanding and explanation for the prediction. In some cases black box models which do not provide an interpretation can be disregarded regardless of their predictive accuracy. In this thesis the problem of model interpretation has been tackled in the context of models to predict toxicity of drug like molecules. ::: ::: Firstly a novel algorithm has been developed for the interpretation of binary classification models where the endpoint meets defined criteria: activity is caused by the presence of a feature and inactivity by the lack of an activating feature or the deactivation of all such activating features. This algorithm has been shown to provide a meaningful interpretation of the model\u2019s cause(s) of both active and inactive predictions for two toxicological endpoints: mutagenicity and skin irritation. The algorithm shows benefits over other interpretation algorithms in its ability to not only identify the causes of activity mapped to fragments and physicochemical descriptors but also in its ability to account for combinatorial effects of the descriptors. The interpretation is presented to the user in the form of the impact of features and can be visualised as a concise summary or in a hierarchical network detailing the full elucidation of the models behaviour for a particular query compound. ::: ::: The interpretation output has been capitalised on and incorporated into a knowledge mining strategy. The knowledge mining is able to extract the learned structure activity relationship trends from a model such as a Random Forest, decision tree, k Nearest Neighbour or support vector machine. These trends can be presented to the user focused around the feature responsible for the assessment such as ACTIVATING or DEACTIVATING. Supporting examples are provided along with an estimation of the models predictive performance for a given SAR trend. ::: ::: Both the interpretation and knowledge mining has been applied to models built for the prediction of Ames mutagenicity and skin irritation.
