In this paper, an astronomical image selection system based on the support vector machine is proposed, which sets the gray value inconsistency and texture difference as the reference to select the images interfered by clouds. Based on the classification results, by through the histogram transformation and feature selection, the index figures of clouds can be further extracted.

This paper proposes a biological water quality monitoring method combining three-dimensional motion trajectory synthesis and integrated learning. The videos of the fish movement are captured by two cameras, and the Kuhn-Munkres (KM) algorithm is used to match the target points of the fish body. The Kalman filter is used to update the current state and find the optimal tracking position as the tracking result. The Kernelized Correlation Filters (KCF) algorithm compensates the targets that are lost in the tracking process and collision or occlusion in the movement process, reducing the errors caused by illumination, occlusion and water surface fluctuation effectively. This algorithm can directly obtain the target motion trajectory, avoiding the re-extraction from the centroid point in the image sequence, which greatly improves the efficiency. In order to avoid the one-sidedness of the two-dimensional trajectory, the experiment combines the pixel coordinates of different perspectives into three-dimensional trajectory pixel coordinates, so as to provide a more authentic fish swimming trajectory. We then select a representative positive and negative sample data set; the number of data sets should have symmetry. The base classifier capable of identifying different water quality is obtained by training. Finally, support vector machine(SVM), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and pointnet based classifiers are combined into strong classifiers through integrated learning. The experimental results show that the integrated learning model can reflect the water quality effectively and accurately under the three-dimensional trajectory pixel coordinates of fish, and the recognition rate of water quality is above 95%.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/sym11091179", "venue": "Symmetry", "journal": "Symmetry", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2973649515", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["123481126", "16495991", "44037287", "41774045", "10770925", "17094921", "12670695", "6758269", "5378407", "12418559", "4650265", "62626941", "1799558", "2375110", "10328909", "206594738", "111257697", "9528733", "23204325", "16945044", "8166368", "206592833", "206593880", "2134321"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204197427"}

Towards this, we present a novel two-stage neural network learning algorithm for domain adaptation which learns a multi-part hidden layer where individual parts contribute differently to the tasks in source and target domains. The multiple parts of the representation (i.e. hidden layer) are learned while being cognizant of what characteristics to transfer across domains and what to preserve within domains for enhanced performance. The first stage embroils around learning a two-part representation i.e. source specific and common representations in a manner such that the former do not detract the ability of the later to represent the target domain. In the second stage, the generalized common representation is further iteratively extended with discriminating target specific characteristics to adapt to the target domain.

Especially challenging is selecting an optimal subset of features from high-dimensional data, which typically have many more variables than observations and contain significant noise, missing components, or outliers. Existing methods either cannot handle high-dimensional data efficiently or scalably, or can only obtain local optimum instead of global optimum. Toward the selection of the globally optimal subset of features efficiently, we introduce a new selector - which we call the Fisher-Markov selector - to identify those features that are the most useful in describing essential differences among the possible groups. In particular, in this paper we present a way to represent essential discriminating characteristics together with the sparsity as an optimization objective. With properly identified measures for the sparseness and discriminativeness in possibly high-dimensional settings, we take a systematic approach for optimizing the measures to choose the best feature subset. We use Markov random field optimization techniques to solve the formulated objective functions for simultaneous feature selection. Our results are noncombinatorial, and they can achieve the exact global optimum of the objective function for some special kernels. The method is fast; in particular, it can be linear in the number of features and quadratic in the number of observations.

One of the current challenges in Alzheimer's Disease (AD)-related research is to achieve an early and definite diagnosis. Automatic classification of AD is typically based on the use of feature vectors of high dimensionality, containing few training patterns, which leads to the curse-of-dimensionality problem. It is indispensable to find good approaches for selecting a subset of the original set of features. In this work, a method to perform early diagnosis of AD is proposed, combining different feature reduction approaches on both brain MRI studies and expression values of blood plasma proteins. Each selected set of features is used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM), then the set of SVM is combined by weighted sum rule. Moreover, a novel approach for considering the feature vector as an image is proposed, different texture descriptors are extracted from the image and used to train a SVM.

Recent research has shown the effectiveness of graph embedding-based subspace learning and extreme learning machine applied to SER, but there are still various drawbacks in these two techniques that limit their application. Regarding subspace learning, the change from linearity to nonlinearity is usually achieved through kernelization, whereas extreme learning machines only take label information into consideration at the output layer. In order to overcome these drawbacks, this paper leverages extreme learning machines for dimensionality reduction and proposes a novel framework to combine spectral regression-based subspace learning and extreme learning machines. The proposed framework contains three stages\u2014data mapping, graph decomposition, and regression. At the data mapping stage, various mapping strategies provide different views of the samples. At the graph decomposition stage, specifically designed embedding graphs provide a possibility to better represent the structure of data through generating virtual coordinates. Finally, at the regression stage, dimension-reduced mappings are achieved by connecting the virtual coordinates and data mapping. Using this framework, we propose several novel dimensionality reduction algorithms, apply them to SER tasks, and compare their performance to relevant state-of-the-art methods.

Numerous methods have been proposed to estimate impervious surfaces from remotely sensed images. However, most of these approaches were proposed with optical remote sensing images, and accurate estimation of impervious surfaces remains challenging due to the diversity of urban land covers. This study presents the effort to synergistically combine optical and SAR data to improve the mapping of impervious surfaces using the Random Forest (RF). The Multilayer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine, and RF are compared for impervious surfaces mapping with the single use of optical image and with the combined optical and SAR images. Experiment shows some interesting results: 1) synergistic use of SPOT-5 and TerraSAR-X images produced more accurate classification of impervious surface mapping, no matter what combinations of features are used; 2) The SAN-based features appeared to provide effective complementary information to the conventional GLCM-based features for the classification, increasing the accuracy by about 0.6% by using supervised classifiers; 3) SVM and RF tended to be superior to MLP for the fusion of SPOT-5 and TerraSAR-X images for LULC classification and ISE.

A key component of our architecture is a novel convolutional filter layer, that produces sketches similar to those drawn by designers during rapid prototyping. The sketches produced are more aesthetic than the ones from standard edge detection filters or gradient operations. In addition, we show that our system is able to generate hitherto unseen perspectives of a car, given a sketch of the car at just a single viewing angle. For extensive training, testing and validation of our system, we have developed a comprehensive, paired dataset of around 100,000 car images (with transparent backgrounds) and their respective sketches. Our work augments human intelligence and creativity using machine learning and deep neural networks. Our system has the significant benefit of reducing the cycle time in the sketch-to-image process which has largely been considered a creative domain. This is achieved by learning to interpret a preliminary sketch drawn by a designer, to generate novel visual designs in a matter of seconds, which may otherwise require considerable time and effort. While the system enhances the productivity of the designer, the machine learning enhanced design visualizations can cut costs during the product prototyping stage. Our system exhibits good impactful potential for the automobile industry and can be easily adapted to industries which require creative intelligence.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-99740-7_11", "venue": "CD-MAKE", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2888466606", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["203078631"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52080389"}

This growth makes people enjoy sharing their activities in social media, including complains about products or services from companies. This behaviour is a big opportunity for a company to know sentiments of customer toward their company. However, classifying sentiments from messages in social media has several challenges. First, the language used in social media often does not have formal structure in their sentence, such as the use of abbreviations, change of letters to numbers, lack of punctuation marks, etc. Second, sentences in social media are domain independent so it's hard to classify the sentence. Related with these challenges, this paper discusses a method to classify sentiments on social media, which is written in Indonesian language. The method we use is to classify each sentence into several classes of sentiment. Before the classification, sentence transformation is done to transform the informal words in the sentence into formal words. The transformation method that we use is the deletion of punctuation mark, the tokenization, the conversion of number to letter, the reduction of repetition letter, the Levensthein distance and using corpus to formalize abbreviation. Formalized sentence will be the input to the classification model for data training and classification process. We classify the message into four classes: Neutral (fact, greetings, etc.), Question, Positive Sentiment, and Negative Sentiment. SVM (Support Vector Machine) and Maximum Entropy are used as the classification algorithms with machine learning features of count of positive, negative, and question word in sentence. From our experimental result, the best classification method is SVM that yields 86,66% accuracy.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021696", "venue": "Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics", "journal": "Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2174991983", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["18531056", "9693668", "7105713", "11945250"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1615704"}

The impact of anthropogenic pressures on marine ecosystems has been relatively little studied because of the lack of data and the difficulty to acquire it. Fine resolution cartographic data (1:10 000) of marine habitats on French Mediterranean coasts have recently become available (Andromede Oceanologie, 2014). This allows using landscape ecology approaches to study the spatial configurations of these habitats, their evolution through time and confront that to anthropogenic and environmental pressures. Here we take advantage of this new data to study Posidonia oceania meadows, a marine habitat of great ecological and economic importance. Posidonia oceanica is an endemic species to the Mediterranean Sea. Posidonia oceanica is also an indicator of the ecological quality of coastal waters since changes in its spatial distribution reflect changes in environmental conditions. The spatial cover of Posidonia oceanica meadows has declined sharply in the last 50 years, in particular because of increased human activities along the coast. In this study, we tested the relative influence (and possible interactions) of anthropogenic coastal pressures and environmental variables (Previmer data) on the decline of Posidonia oceanica meadows in the French Mediterranean sea. Different composition and configuration landscape descriptors were calculated for different grid cells (400m x 400m; 200m x 200m, 100m x 100m), between 0 and 40 m depth over 1800 km of French Mediterranean coastline (Mainland + Corsica). An approach using Random Forest was applied to explain these indices with the anthropogenic and environmental factors and to identify the factors that contribute the most to the decline of Posidonia oceanica meadows. With a model that explains 87% of overall variance, our results show a very important effect of environmental factors on the decline and the patchs cohesion of Posidonia oceanica meadows. Anthropogenic pressures also have a destructive effect on the posidonia, because if the intensity of the pressures is high, the decline is strong and the cohesion between the patches is weak.The identification of tipping points for all environmental variables shows that some seagrasses are in areas of good environmental conditions and others in weak environmental conditions.

Here a manufacturing system, namely the continuous casting process of steel making, is the object of study and both Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) have been shown to perform the above function.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the most effective machine learning methods used in this field. The performance of SVM-based methods depends on the vector representations of RNAs. However, the discriminative power of the existing feature vectors is limited, and many methods lack an interpretable model for analysis of characteristic sequence features. Prior studies have demonstrated that sequence or structure order effects were relevant for discrimination, but little work has explored how to use this kind of information for human pre-microRNA identification. In this study, in order to incorporate the structure-order information into the prediction, a method called \"miRNA-dis\" was proposed, in which the feature vector was constructed by the occurrence frequency of the \"distance structure status pair\" or just the \"distance-pair\". Rigorous cross-validations on a much larger and more stringent newly constructed benchmark dataset showed that the miRNA-dis outperformed some state-of-the-art predictors in this area. Remarkably, miRNA-dis trained with human data can correctly predict 87.02% of the 4022 pre-miRNAs from 11 different species ranging from animals, plants and viruses. miRNA-dis would be a useful high throughput tool for large-scale analysis of microRNA precursors. In addition, the learnt model can be easily analyzed in terms of discriminative features, and some interesting patterns were discovered, which could reflect the characteristics of microRNAs.

Suitability of the linear retention modelling in the HILIC and RP modes was tested including separate contributions from adsorption and partition. For the HILIC retention, the partition model was found to provide better description compared with the adsorption model. In a wider range of the aqueous eluent volume fractions, \u03c6(aq), retention was described as a function of volume fractions and total polarity of mobile phase using the mixed-mode retention modelling. The obtained results revealed that the shift of the chromatographic mode can be calculated from the change of total polarity of mobile phase in a multi-modal relation, logarithm of retention factor vs. total polarity, with the minimum value representing the turning point between the HILIC and the RP mode. Molecular properties of the investigated compounds that influence the retention behavior and the turning point were selected using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Specializing FW to SVM training has allowed to obtain efficient algorithms but also important theoretical results, including convergence analysis of training algorithms and new characterizations of model sparsity. ::: In this paper, we present and analyze a novel variant of the FW method based on a new way to perform away steps, a classic strategy used to accelerate the convergence of the basic FW procedure. Our formulation and analysis is focused on a general concave maximization problem on the simplex. However, the specialization of our algorithm to quadratic forms is strongly related to some classic methods in computational geometry, namely the Gilbert and MDM algorithms. ::: On the theoretical side, we demonstrate that the method matches the guarantees in terms of convergence rate and number of iterations obtained by using classic away steps. In particular, the method enjoys a linear rate of convergence, a result that has been recently proved for MDM on quadratic forms. ::: On the practical side, we provide experiments on several classification datasets, and evaluate the results using statistical tests. Experiments show that our method is faster than the FW method with classic away steps, and works well even in the cases in which classic away steps slow down the algorithm.

The output of the ELM is used to embed a binary watermark in the video frames using a pre-specified formula. The resultant video exhibits good visual quality. Five different video processing attacks are executed over signed video. The extracted watermarks from the signed and attacked video yield high normalized correlation (NC) values and low Bit Error Rate (BER) values.

Finally, we show that an SVM training problem can always be made degenerate by the addition of a single data point belonging to a certain unbounded polyhedron, which we characterize in terms of its extreme points and rays.", "year": 1999, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/3-540-46769-6_21", "venue": "A.i. memo, MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2160353894", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["194951", "52874011"], "inbound_citations": ["13323943", "9672413", "104333"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15223500"}

The typical method for annotating the training data by human experts is considered time consuming, labor intensive and sometimes prone to error. Moreover, such an approach is not easily extensible to new domains/languages since such extensions require annotating new training data. In this study, we propose a distant supervised learning approach where the training sentences are automatically annotated based on the emojis they have. Such training data would be very cheap to produce compared with the manually created training data, thus, much larger training data can be easily obtained. On the other hand, this training data would naturally have lower quality as it may contain some errors in the annotation. Nonetheless, we experimentally show that training classifiers on cheap, large and possibly erroneous data annotated using this approach leads to more accurate results compared with training the same classifiers on the more expensive, much smaller and error-free manually annotated training data. Our experiments are conducted on an in-house dataset of emotional Arabic tweets and the classifiers we consider are: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) and Random Forest (RF). In addition to experimenting with single classifiers, we also consider using an ensemble of classifiers.

In practice, it is performed based on estimator's experience. However, due to the inaccuracy of cost estimate, budgeting and cost control are planned and executed inefficiently. Support Vector Machines (SVMs), an Artificial Intelligent technique, is used to conduct the construction cost estimate. The algorithms of SVMs solve a convex optimization problem in a relative short time with satisfied accurate solution. Applying SVMs, the construction conceptual cost estimate model is developed for owners and planners to predict the construction cost of a project. The impact factors of cost estimate are identified through literature review and interview with experts. The cost data of 29 construction projects are used as training cases. Based on the training results, the average prediction error is less than 10% and the computation time is less than 5 minutes. The error is satisfied for the conceptual cost estimate of a project during the planning and conceptual design phase. Case studies show SVMs can efficiently and accurately assist planners to predict the construction cost. cost based on their experiences. Nevertheless, building cost is effected by numerous factors. Some of these factors are full of uncertainty such as geological property and decorative class. Due to such complex and uncertain evaluation process, estimators evaluate building cost using a simple linear manner cannot accurately evaluate the costs. As a result, present building cost estimates are rough.

Firstly, some main features are extracted from the handwritten digital images (Euler Number, roundness, moment feature, crossing density, pixel density). Secondly, adopt the method of SVM for classification. This paper adds the feature values normalized, using radial basis function and Cross-validation important parameters. Our approach has been implemented with MNIST database and we have achieved an average recognition rate of 96.3%, the lowest single digit recognition rate of 93.5% when the training data are 100\u00d710. Introduction Handwritten digit recognition is a branch of optical character recognition technology. The main research of the handwritten digit recognition is how to use the computer automatically recognize handwritten digits. Due to the extensive use of digital symbols (such as postal code, bank check, financial forms), the Handwritten digit recognition technology is widely attention. It has been one of the hotspots with high practical value in the field of pattern recognition. At present there are four main methods in the field of handwritten digit recognition. They are Bayesian Classification [1], Clustering Analysis [2], Neural Network [3] and SVM [4, 5]. A major problem in handwriting recognition is the huge variability and distortions of patterns. Elastic models based on local observations and dynamic programming such Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is not efficient to absorb this variability [6].The SVM is a machine learning algorithm developed based on the statistical theory, and it has advantages in solving small sample size and nonlinear pattern recognition problems. Image Preprocessing Feature Extraction Classification Fig. 1 Three main operations As shown in Fig. 1, there are three main parts of handwritten digit recognition (image preprocessing, feature extraction and classification). Different features have different impact on the recognition rate, the feature extraction plays a key role in the recognition. Some scholars focus on the study of the feature extraction [7, 8]. In this paper, we select the SVM as a classification method. In the next part, we will describe the selected features in detail. Meanwhile, in order achieve higher recognition rate we adopt some optimization steps before the data training operation. Feature Extraction In this section, several main features used by this paper will be introduced. Euler Number. Euler number is a topological parameters used to describe the object structure. Euler number is defined as: the difference between the connecting number and the number of holes. It can be expressed in the following formula: E L K = \u2212 (1) E represents the value of the Euler number, L represents the number of the connecting, K represents the number of holes.

As a result, traditional statistical methods, which work well with a small quantity of data described by simple features, are not always effective for these new applications. In this dissertation, we explore the challenges that a large volume of high-dimensional data poses for a visual-data retrieval system. ::: To facilitate better data organization, we can assign labels to the data by mapping the low-level features (such as color and texture) to some high-level semantics (such as \u201canimal\u201d and \u201clandscape\u201d). We present an annotation system which first uses Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to predict class-label memberships, and then employs confidence factors to ascertain the correctness of the class-prediction. The system makes dynamic adjustments to accommodate new semantics, to assist in the discovery of useful low-level features, and to improve class-prediction accuracy. ::: In order to retrieve data that a user wants, the retrieval system needs to learn the user's query concept. A concept-dependent active learning scheme is proposed for the learning task. The scheme makes use of multimodal information (low-level features and semantic labels) to model the concept-complexity, and then make intelligent adjustments to the sampling strategy to improve concept learnability. With the improved learnability, the retrieval precision can be increased. ::: To support rapid searches through large volume of data, we need a clustering/classification approach is proposed to index the high-dimensional data. We first cluster similar data and store each cluster sequentially on disk. We then model the similarity search as a classification problem\u2014similar objects are much more likely to be found in clusters into which the query instance has been classified. This approach is not only able to support relevance feedback, which alters the feature weighting, but also able to support non-metric similarity measures. More specifically, our indexer uses the dynamic partial function (DPF), which quantifies the similarity between data instances significantly better than do the Minkowski-like functions for measuring perceptual similarity. ::: Through extensive empirical studies on several large and high-dimensional image datasets, we show that our proposed approaches are able to perform data retrievals more effectively, and efficiently than traditional methods.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2265232555", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61782920"}

In order to overcome these problems, an approach to continuous approximation of Pareto front using geometric support vector regression is presented. The regression model of the small size approximate discrete Pareto front is constructed by geometric support vector regression modeling and is described as the approximate continuous Pareto front. In the process of geometric support vector regression modeling, considering the distribution characteristic of Pareto optimal points, the separable augmented training sample sets are constructed by shifting original training sample points along multiple coordinated axes. Besides, an interactive decision-making (DM) procedure, in which the continuous approximation of Pareto front and decision-making is performed interactively, is designed for improving the accuracy of the preferred Pareto optimal point. The correctness of the continuous approximation of Pareto front is demonstrated with a typical multi-objective optimization problem. In addition, combined with the interactive decision-making procedure, the continuous approximation of Pareto front is applied in the multi-objective optimization for an industrial fed-batch yeast fermentation process. The experimental results show that the generated approximate continuous Pareto front has good accuracy and completeness. Compared with the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with large size population, a more accurate preferred Pareto optimal point can be obtained from the approximate continuous Pareto front with less computation and shorter running time. The operation strategy corresponding to the final preferred Pareto optimal point generated by the interactive DM procedure can improve the production indexes of the fermentation process effectively.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cjche.2014.09.003", "venue": null, "journal": "Chinese Journal of Chemical Engineering", "mag_id": "1987990468", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:93285299"}

Since they better capture complex traits in the sequences, string kernels often achieve better prediction performance. RNA interference is a cell defense mechanism with many biological and therapeutical applications, where strings can be used to represent target messenger RNAs and initiating short RNAs and string kernels can be applied for training and prediction. While most existing string kernels are developed for general purpose sequences and have been applied to text and protein classifications, the RNA string kernel is particularly designed to model mismatches, GU wobbles, and bulges of RNA biology and has been applied to RNAi off-target evaluation. We adapt the RNA string kernel to compute the similarity of siRNA sequences and use it in support vector regression to predict siRNA silencing efficacy. We evaluate the performance of the RNA kernel against the spectrum kernel, the string subsequence kernel of arbitrary mismatch, the randomized string kernel, and numerical kernels computed from numerical features extracted according to siRNA design rules. We also give insights into computational performance and common properties and differences of the RNA kernel as compared to other kernels. Empirical results on biological data sets demonstrate that the RNA string kernel performed favorably than most existing string kernels and achieved significant improvements over kernels computed from numerical descriptors extracted according to structural and thermodynamic rules. Meanwhile, the string kernels achieved favorable results relative to other methods in related work. Furthermore, the RNA string kernel is simple to implement and fast to compute.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/BIBE.2007.4375581", "venue": "2007 IEEE 7th International Symposium on BioInformatics and BioEngineering", "journal": "2007 IEEE 7th International Symposium on BioInformatics and BioEngineering", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2068282877", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["4426281", "21551507", "10041179", "15790930", "43356800", "11030533", "5654543", "16892703", "15316350", "24778534", "9725578", "669209", "1192563", "10538947", "15480929"], "inbound_citations": ["5652521"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21117807"}

The accuracy of the system was compared with standard discriminant analysis using both direct and multi-step classifications. It was discovered that the radial basis SVM after Wilk's @l was more precise in classification compared to other classifiers.

However, image processing of touching biscuits was considerably slower compared to non-touching biscuits, averaging at 36.3ms and 9.0ms, respectively.

However, these algorithms require a high computational cost during the training phase, which can limit their application on large-scale datasets. Moreover, it is known that their effectiveness highly depends on the hyper-parameters used to train the model. With the intention of dealing with these, this paper introduces an evolutionary multiobjective model and instance selection (IS) approach for SVMs with Pareto-based ensemble, whose goals are, precisely, to optimize the size of the training set and the classification performance attained by the selection of the instances, which can be done using either a wrapper or a filter approach. Due to the nature of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, several Pareto optimal solutions can be found. We study several ways of using such information to perform a classification task. To accomplish this, our proposal performs a processing over the Pareto solutions in order to combine them into a single ensemble. This is done in five different ways, which are based on: 1) a global Pareto ensemble; 2) error reduction; 3) a complementary error reduction; 4) maximized margin distance; and 5) boosting.

While hardware architectures for RNNs have been studied, hardware-based CTCdecoders are desired for high-speed CTC-based inference systems.

The two most common required material properties are Poisson\u2019s ratio and Young\u2019s modulus. These elastic properties are often reliably determined from laboratory tests by using cores extracted from wells under simulated reservoir conditions. Unfortunately, most wells have limited core data. On the other hand, wells typically have log data. By using suitable regression models, the log data can be used to extend knowledge of core-based elastic properties to the entire field. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have proven to be successful in many reservoir characterization problems. Although nonlinear problems can be well resolved by ANN-based models, extensive numerical experiments (training) must be done to optimize the network structure. In addition, generated regression models from ANNs may not perfectly generalize to unseen input data. Recently, support vector machines (SVMs) have proven successful in several real-world applications for its potential to generalize and converge to a global optimal solution. SVM models are based on the structural risk minimization principle that minimizes the generalization error by striking a balance between empirical training error and learning machine capacity. This has proven superior in several applications to the empirical risk minimization (ERM) principle adopted by ANNs that aims to reduce the training error only. Here, support vector regression (SVR) to predict Poisson\u2019s ratio and Young\u2019s modulus is described. The method uses a fuzzy-based ranking algorithm to select the most significant input variables and filter out dependency. The learning and predictive capabilities of the SVR method is compared to that of a backpropagation neural network (BPNN). The results demonstrate that SVR has similar or superior learning and prediction capabilities to that of the BPNN. Parameter sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate the effect of the SVM regularization parameter, the regression tube radius, and the type of kernel function used.

In this paper, we propose a novel Part-Preserving Generative Adversarial Network (PP-GAN) to achieve good manipulation quality by explicitly enforcing rich structure constraints over generative modeling. PP-GAN is proposed to decompose the challenging spatial transformation of the whole body into fine-grained part-level transformations, which are then integrated via human joint structure constraint. Given arbitrary poses, PP-GAN integrates human joint structure and region-level part cues as inputs to perform explicit generative modeling. Besides, we introduce a parsing-consistent loss to enforce semantic consistency among images with diverse poses, which guides the image synthesis from a semantic perspective. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on two benchmarks show that our PP-GAN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in generating more realistic and plausible image synthesis results.

As remote sensing can provide such information, it evolved to be a standard tool to work on related subjects. Image classification often forms the basis for used workflows and derived products. The emergence of new sensor technologies which provide very high spatial and spectral resolution data, made the consideration of objects at finer scales possible and broadened the scope of potential applications of remote sensing. Novel image processing and classification methods such as object-based image analysis and support vector machines, are introduced to effectively exploit the information provided by improved resolutions. Nevertheless, especially for supervised approaches, classification results still depend strongly on the amount and distribution of available ground truth data as information input for training of classifiers. This thesis aims to address the issue by proposing a generic method capable of coping with small ground truth data sets to classify very high spatial resolution data. This is done by transferring invariant support vector machines to the methodology of object-based image analysis. Resulting classifiers appear invariant to scale or geometry representation in ground truth data sets and thus achieve better classification accuracies on limited information input. Experiments on a very-high-resolution image of a complex urban land cover composition - cologne city center - suggest that the proposed method has much scope for future developments. Results show 0.2-0.03 points of kappa accuracy improvement (to reach 0.57-0.79) on small ground truth data sets (20 or less training samples per class) compared to a state of the art classification system for a binary classification problem.

The model was subsequently validated by the leave-one-out (LOO) procedure obtaining a q(2) of 0.71. Random Forests were grown with the entire set of MOLMAP descriptors giving 70% of correct classifications as potent, active or inactive in a LOO experiment. Interpretations of both models in terms of discriminant variables were concordant and allowed identifying bonds and substructures that are mostly responsible for antioxidant activity. This work shows how MOLMAPs can be used for data mining of structural and biological activity data, leading to the extraction of relationships between local properties and activity.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "16230016", "doi": "10.1016/j.bmc.2005.09.047", "venue": "Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry", "journal": "Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry", "mag_id": "2076587168", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["13035675", "35971899", "37525573"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:41189183"}

Motivating such endeavors is the desire for models to capture not only objects present in an image, but more fine-grained aspects of a scene such as relationships between objects and their attributes. Scene graphs provide a formal construct for capturing these aspects of an image. Despite this, there have been only a few recent efforts to generate scene graphs from imagery. Previous works limit themselves to settings where bounding box information is available at train time and do not attempt to generate scene graphs with attributes. In this paper we propose a method, based on recent advancements in Generative Adversarial Networks, to overcome these deficiencies. We take the approach of first generating small subgraphs, each describing a single statement about a scene from a specific region of the input image chosen using an attention mechanism. By doing so, our method is able to produce portions of the scene graphs with attribute information without the need for bounding box labels. Then, the complete scene graph is constructed from these subgraphs. We show that our model improves upon prior work in scene graph generation on state-of-the-art data sets and accepted metrics.

In this work, a new Extreme Learning Machines' (ELMs) Ensemble Selection algorithm based on the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP), referred to as ELMsGraspEnS, is proposed for credit risk assessment of enterprises. On the one hand, the ELM is used as the base learner for ELMsGraspEnS owing to its significant advantages including an extremely fast learning speed, good generalization performance, and avoidance of issues like local minima and overfitting. On the other hand, to ameliorate the local optima problem faced by classical greedy ensemble selection methods, we incorporated GRASP, a meta-heuristic multi-start algorithm for combinatorial optimization problems, into the solution of ensemble selection, and proposed an ensemble selection algorithm based on GRASP (GraspEnS) in our previous work. The GraspEnS algorithm has the following three advantages. (1) By incorporating a random factor, a solution is often able to escape local optima. (2) GraspEnS realizes a multi-start search to some degree. (3) A better performing subensemble can usually be found with GraspEnS. Moreover, not much research on applying ensemble selection approaches to credit scoring has been reported in the literature. In this paper, we integrate the ELM with GraspEnS, and propose a novel ensemble selection algorithm based on GRASP (ELMsGraspEnS). ELMsGraspEnS naturally inherits the inherent advantages of both the ELM and GraspEnS, effectively combining their advantages. The experimental results of applying ELMsGraspEnS to three benchmark real world credit datasets show that in most cases ELMsGraspEnS significantly improves the performance of credit risk assessment compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms.

Classification algorithms that help to predict software defects play a major role in software engineering process. Some studies have depicted that the use of ensembles is often more accurate than using single classifiers. However, variations exist from studies, which posited that the efficiency of learning algorithms might vary using different performance measures. This is because most studies on SDP consider the accuracy of the model or classifier above other performance metrics. This paper evaluated the performance of single classifiers (SMO, MLP, k NN and Decision Tree) and ensembles (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking and Voting) in SDP considering major performance metrics using Analytic Network Process (ANP) multi-criteria decision method. The experiment was based on 11 performance metrics over 11 software defect datasets. Boosted SMO, Voting and Stacking Ensemble methods ranked highest with a priority level of 0.0493, 0.0493 and 0.0445 respectively. Decision tree ranked highest in single classifiers with 0.0410. These clearly show that ensemble methods can give better classification results in SDP and Boosting method gave the best result. In essence, it is valid to say that before deciding which model or classifier is better for software defect prediction, all performance metrics should be considered.

Most annotations of PPIs mix experimental and computational data. The mix optimizes coverage, but obfuscates the annotation origin. Some resources excel at focusing on reliable experimental data. Here, we focused on new pairs of interacting proteins for several model organisms based solely on sequence-based prediction methods. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: We extracted reliable experimental data about which proteins interact (binary) for eight diverse model organisms from public databases, namely from Escherichia coli, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Plasmodium falciparum, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Arabidopsis thaliana, and for the previously used Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Those data were the base to develop a PPI prediction method for each model organism. The method used evolutionary information through a profile-kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM). With the resulting eight models, we predicted all possible protein pairs in each organism and made the top predictions available through a web application. Almost all of the PPIs made available were predicted between proteins that have not been observed in any interaction, in particular for less well-studied organisms. Thus, our work complements existing resources and is particularly helpful for designing experiments because of its uniqueness. Experimental annotations and computational predictions are strongly influenced by the fact that some proteins have many partners and others few. To optimize machine learning, recent methods explicitly ignored such a network-structure and rely either on domain knowledge or sequence-only methods.

The main objective of this Frontiers Research Topic is to present state-of-the-art research on IMs and open-ended development from an interdisciplinary perspective involving human and animal psychology, neuroscience, and computational perspectives. We first introduce in this section the main themes and concepts on IMs from different interdisciplinary perspectives. These themes and concepts have been reviewed more extensively in other works (e.g., see Barto et al., 2004; Oudeyer and Kaplan, 2007; Mirolli and Baldassarre, 2013; Barto, 2013), but they are briefly reported here both to meet the needs of the reader new to the field and to introduce the concepts and terms we use in the succeeding sections. In the next four sections, we give an overview of the Topic contributions grouped by four themes. A final section draws the conclusions. ::: ::: Autonomous development and lifelong open-ended learning are hallmarks of intelligence. Higher mammals, and especially humans, engage in activities that do not appear to directly serve the goals of survival, reproduction, or material advantage. Rather, many activities seem to be carried out \u201cfor their own sake\u201d (Berlyne, 1966), play being a prime example, but including other activities driven by curiosity and interest in novel stimuli or surprising events. Autonomously setting goals and working to acquire new forms of competence are also examples of activities that often do not confer obvious evolutionary benefit. Activities like these are thus said to be driven by intrinsic motivations (Baldassarre and Mirolli, 2013a). IMs facilitate the cumulative and virtually open-ended acquisition of knowledge and skills that can later be used to accomplish fitness-enhancing goals (Singh et al., 2010; Baldassarre, 2011). IMs continue during adulthood, and they underlie several important human phenomena such as artistic creativity, scientific discovery, and subjective well-being (Ryan and Deci, 2000b; Schmidhuber, 2010). ::: ::: IMs were proposed within the animal literature to explain aspects of behavior that could not be explained by the dominant theory of motivation postulating that animals work to reduce physiological imbalances (Hull, 1943). The term \u201cintrinsic motivation\u201d was first used to describe a \u201cmanipulation drive\u201d hypothesized to explain why rhesus monkeys would engage with mechanical puzzles for long periods of time without receiving extrinsic rewards (Harlow et al., 1950). Other studies showed how animal instrumental actions can be conditioned with the delivery of apparently neutral stimuli: for example, monkeys were trained to perform actions to gain access to a window from which they could observe conspecifics (Butler, 1953), and mice were trained to perform actions that resulted in clicks or in moving the cage platform (Kish, 1955). The psychological literature on IMs initially linked them to the perceptual properties of stimuli, such as their complexity, novel appearance, or surprising features (Berlyne, 1950, 1966). Later, IMs were also related to action, in particular to the competence (\u201ceffectance\u201d) that an agent can acquire to willfully make changes in its environment (White, 1959). This relation of IMs with action and their effects was later linked to the possibility of autonomously setting one's own goals (Ryan and Deci, 2000a). ::: ::: Computational approaches, in particular machine learning and autonomous robotics, are concerned with IMs and open-ended development as these are thought to have the potential to lead to the construction of truly intelligent artificial systems, in particular systems that are capable of improving their own skills and knowledge autonomously and indefinitely. The relation of these studies with those on IMs in psychology were first highlighted by Barto et al. (2004) and Singh et al. (2005). The investigation of IMs from a computational perspective can lead to theoretical clarifications, in particular with respect to the computational mechanisms and functions that might underlie IMs (Mirolli and Baldassarre, 2013). IM mechanisms have been classified as being either knowledge-based or competence-based (Oudeyer and Kaplan, 2007): the former based on measures related to the acquisition of information, and the latter on measures related to the learning of skills. More recently, knowledge-based IMs have been further divided into novelty-based IMs and prediction-based IMs (Baldassarre and Mirolli, 2013b; Barto et al., 2013). Novelty-based IMs are elicited by the experience of stimuli that are not in the agent's memory (e.g., novel objects, or novel object-object or object-context combinations); prediction-based IMs are related to events that surprise the agent by violating its explicit predictions. ::: ::: These distinctions have been formalized in the computational models proposed in the literature. Seminal works in machine learning (Schmidhuber, 1991), later developed to function in robots (Oudeyer et al., 2007), have proposed algorithms rewarding actions that allow the agent to improve the quality of a \u201cpredictor\u201d component with which it anticipates the effects that such actions produce on the environment. Other researchers have proposed robots capable of detecting and focussing on novel stimuli (e.g., Marsland et al., 2005), or systems capable of detecting anomalies in datasets (Nehmzow et al., 2013). Additional research threads have focussed on action and control, in particular on IMs guiding the autonomous acquisition of motor skills (Barto et al., 2004), on the decision about which of several skills to practice at any time (Schembri et al., 2007; Santucci et al., 2013), and on the the autonomous formation of goals guiding skill acquisition (Baranes and Oudeyer, 2013). Other computational mechanisms related to the idea of IMs are being proposed in the growing field of active learning, in particular in relation to supervised learning systems (Settles, 2010). ::: ::: Recent neuroscientific investigations are revealing brain mechanisms that possibly underlie the IM systems investigated in the behavioral and computational literature. However, unfortunately such investigations are carried out under agendas different from the one on IMs, e.g., in relation to dopamine, memory, motor learning, goal-directed behavior, and conflict monitoring, so comprehensive views are still missing. A large body of research shows how the hippocampus, a brain compound system playing pivotal functions for memory, has the capacity to detect the novelty of various aspects of experience, from the novelty of single items to the novelty of item-item and item-context associations (Ranganath and Rainer, 2003; Kumaran and Maguire, 2007). This detection is then capable of triggering the release of neuromodulators, such as dopamine, that modulate the functioning and learning processes of the hippocampus itself and other brain areas, e.g., of the frontal cortex involved in higher cognition, action planning, and action execution (Lisman and Grace, 2005). Other studies have shown that unexpected stimuli can activate the superior colliculus, a midbrain structure that plays a key role in oculomotor control, which in turn causes phasic bursts of dopamine affecting trial-and-error learning processes happening in basal ganglia, a brain region known to be involved in learning to select actions and other cortex contents (Redgrave and Gurney, 2006). Dopamine signals have also been shown to have an interesting direct relationship with information seeking (Bromberg-Martin and Hikosaka, 2009). Noradrenaline, another neuromodulator targeting a large part of brain, has been shown to be involved in signaling violations of the agent's expectations (Sara, 2009). The failure (Carter et al., 1998) or success (Ribas-Fernandes et al., 2011) in accomplishing goals and sub-goals, possibly themselves set by IMs, has been shown to have neural correlates that might affect succeeding motivation, engagement, and learning. Bio-inspired/bio-constrained computational modeling is linking some of these neuroscientific results to specific computational mechanisms, e.g., in relation to dopamine (e.g., see the pioneering work of Kakade and Dayan, 2002, and Mirolli et al., 2013) and goal-directed behavior (Baldassare et al., 2013). ::: ::: The 24 interdisciplinary contributions to the present Research Topic can be clustered into four groups. The first group of six contributions (IMs and brain and behavior) focuses on different types of IM mechanisms implemented in the brain. The second group of five contributions (IMs and attention) focuses on the role of IMs in attention. The third group of eight contributions (IMs and motor skills) focuses on IMs as drives for the acquisition of manipulation and navigation skills, often with an emphasis on their function in enabling cumulative, open-ended development. Finally, the fourth group of five contributions (IMs and social interaction) focuses on the relationship between IMs and social phenomena, a novel area of investigation of IMs that is increasingly attracting the attention of researchers.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4158798", "pubmed_id": "25249998", "doi": "10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00985", "venue": "Front.

In this challenging setting, we study how two variants of Random Forests (RF) perform under four strategies to incorporate new classes while avoiding to retrain the RFs from scratch. The various strategies account for different trade-offs between classification accuracy and computational efficiency. In our extensive experiments, we show that both RF variants, one based on Nearest Class Mean classifiers and the other on SVMs, outperform conventional RFs and are well suited for incrementally learning new classes.

In this paper, we demonstrate that, contrary to popular intuition, empirical data suggests that simple travel time predictors come very close to the fundamental error bounds achievable in delay prediction. We derive such bounds by estimating entropy that remains in travel time distributions, even after all spatio-temporal delay-influencing factors have been accounted for. Our results are based on analysis of cab traces from New York City, that feature 15 million trips. While we cannot claim generalizability to other cities, the results suggest the diminishing return of complex travel-time predictors due to the inherent nature of uncertainty in trip delays.

In addition, a strategy of band selection was proposed for solving the endmember variability issue. The unmixing results were analysed in terms of the overall performance, pure and mixed data set, sub-scenes with different mixture proportions by calculating the accuracy indices: root mean square error RMSE and the Pearson correlation coefficient r. Nonlinear approaches can generate a closer abundance fraction map to reference, and have a higher overall accuracy than the linear approach. Nevertheless, the performance of nonlinear approaches differed dramatically with the increased proportion of mixed pixels in different study areas. SVM, SFCM, BFM, and PPNM depicted a scenario better when the proportion of mixed pixels was high, whereas ANN worked more effectively when processing large amounts of relatively pure pixels or mixed pixels with large/extreme proportions. The linear approach, in contrast, performed more consistently for various areas. Overall, our study indicates that nonlinear approaches are more effective than the linear one, especially for a study area consisting of different small parcels. The performance of nonlinear approaches is more sensitive to the proportion change of mixed pixels in a study area.

Following the key principle of supervised learning, i.e., similar inputs yield similar outputs, we require the graph signals induced by labels to have small total variation. Accordingly, we formulate the problem of learning the labels of data points as a non-smooth convex optimization problem which amounts to balancing between the empirical loss, i.e., the discrepancy with some partially available label information, and the smoothness quantified by the total variation of the learned graph signal. We solve this optimization problem by appealing to a recently proposed preconditioned variant of the popular primal-dual method by Pock and Chambolle, which results in a sparse label propagation algorithm. This learning algorithm allows for a highly scalable implementation as message passing over the underlying data graph. By applying concepts of compressed sensing to the learning problem, we are also able to provide a transparent sufficient condition on the underlying network structure such that accurate learning of the labels is possible.

Bayesian optimization is employed to tune the hyperparameters of the MTL model with limited computational costs. Numerical experiments are carried out with taxis\u2019 GPS data in an urban road network of Changsha, China, and some conclusions are drawn as follows. The deep learning based MTL model outperforms four deep learning based single task learning (STL) models (i.e., Gated Recurrent Units network, Long Short-term Memory network, Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units network and Temporal Convolutional Network) and three other classic models (i.e., Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbors and Evolving Fuzzy Neural Network). The nonlinear Granger causality test provides a reliable guide to select the informative features from network-wide links for the MTL model. Compared with two other optimization approaches (i.e., grid search and random search), Bayesian optimization yields a better tuning performance for the MTL model in the prediction accuracy under the budgeted computation cost. In summary, the deep learning based MTL model with nonlinear Granger causality analysis and Bayesian optimization promises the accurate and efficient traffic speed prediction for a large-scale network.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2018.10.097", "venue": null, "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2942392852", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["182230231", "199468094", "210930368"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:150074054"}

We propose instance cross entropy (ICE) which measures the difference between an estimated instance-level matching distribution and its ground-truth one. ICE has three main appealing properties. Firstly, similar to categorical cross entropy (CCE), ICE has clear probabilistic interpretation and exploits structured semantic similarity information for learning supervision. Secondly, ICE is scalable to infinite training data as it learns on mini-batches iteratively and is independent of the training set size. Thirdly, motivated by our relative weight analysis, seamless sample reweighting is incorporated. It rescales samples' gradients to control the differentiation degree over training examples instead of truncating them by sample mining.

Lately, a few attempts have been made to type a whole word with the help of a smart dictionary that suggests some candidate words with the input of a few initial characters. MethodsIn this paper, we propose a novel paradigm utilizing initial character typing with word suggestions and a novel P300 classifier to increase word typing speed and accuracy. The novel paradigm involves modifying the Text on 9 keys (T9) interface, which is similar to the keypad of a mobile phone used for text messaging. Users can type the initial characters using a 3i?3 matrix interface and an integrated custom-built dictionary that suggests candidate words as the user types the initials. Then the user can select one of the given suggestions to complete word typing. We have adopted a random forest classifier, which significantly improves P300 classification accuracy by combining multiple decision trees. Results and discussionWe conducted experiments with 10 subjects using the proposed BCI system. Our proposed paradigms significantly reduced word typing time and made word typing more convenient by outputting complete words with only a few initial character inputs. The conventional spelling system required an average time of 3.47min per word while typing 10 random words, whereas our proposed system took an average time of 1.67min per word, a 51.87% improvement, for the same words under the same conditions. A Text on nine keys (T9) based efficient word typing P300-BCI system is proposed.We integrated a smart dictionary into the P300-BCI system for word suggestions.We propose a novel Random Forest (RF) classifier to improve accuracy.Words typing speed is improved by 51.87% in comparison to the conventional character speller.Accuracy of RF is significantly higher than the conventional SVM classifier.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "25464346", "doi": "10.1016/j.compbiomed.2014.10.021", "venue": "Computers in biology and medicine", "journal": "Computers in biology and medicine", "mag_id": "2111255179", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["214860626", "206098069", "32383458", "3697413", "203566193", "59554308", "3652130", "27098108", "19650169", "215371358", "209460746", "3298791", "9417422", "4508288", "52003427", "37097181", "14382667", "211043891", "4893715", "122342141"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1493565"}

The objective evaluation of the resulting aged and rejuvenated face images by the state-of-the-art face recognition and age estimation solutions demonstrate the high potential of the proposed method.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1702.01983", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICIP.2017.8296650", "venue": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)", "journal": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2951961735,2587706859", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1241203", "15970160", "2825965", "11632904", "206592400", "18592845", "1033682", "8785311", "3559987", "11758569", "6628106", "14924561", "206592766", "6398414", "14979423", "12609235", "16506546"], "inbound_citations": ["58981955", "4461076", "199488391", "4395181", "204868002", "210127265", "48362146", "155898151", "33991152", "53157932", "208157941", "208208327", "198145997", "53207476", "209899240", "2717079", "4933849", "210714144", "50771534", "209459007", "3577925", "208005032", "165163911", "49673348", "209439898", "208209349", "53020098", "211679084", "199472666", "199577425", "182209110", "56895281", "145947506", "146118843", "210995342", "203605500", "14323451", "201698190", "210164613", "67095042", "947451", "3424247", "209458217", "52066874", "102352826", "67875265", "53023241", "52894495", "59292011", "133605902", "182164433", "213177577", "197677814", "4110173", "54442889", "131773768", "53717925", "88464975", "53753063", "32789333", "7276932", "198181039", "198181039", "38737775", "160020908", "4951598", "7451980", "197642478", "207930664", "199489497", "170078905", "195750834", "69273727", "61808533", "213005853", "208548439", "148564053", "53304740", "207900391", "207900391", "195791453", "53746712", "189824897", "210921184", "195881905", "5060966", "209324562", "207831043", "209458551", "209415124", "4892342", "211243128", "6144520", "195791662", "53189344", "214618306", "52954446", "51952630", "209531766", "195883757", "212705697", "119308874", "59608660", "204786648", "3657170", "209459656", "33360855", "49530438", "24962907", "52297254", "214596246", "27009824", "29681354", "210839653", "215722488", "9175763", "3882452", "52959267", "211120634", "196150698", "208156927", "202764014", "3628759", "214612233", "153312731", "49863221", "59234295", "199423055", "53523202", "202676703", "132043068", "53249915", "211297616", "34667556", "50786650", "148566791", "160026565", "214900427", "201058738", "51865118", "51994554"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3465604"}

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is an approach to solve classification problem by using optimization method. Selecting different kernel parameters can construct different classifiers, meanwhile parameters decide their learning and generalization ability. In order to solve the limitation of selecting parameters by experience, so the particle swarm (PSO) pattern search algorithm is proposed to search optimal parameters and take them into the practice of hospital customer classification; The PSO mode search algorithm is to combine the advantages of PSO algorithm and pattern search algorithm, PSO mode search algorithm has strong global search capability and good advantage of local convergence.

Recent approaches have attempted to harness the capabilities of deep learning techniques for image recognition to tackle pixel-level labelling tasks. One central issue in this methodology is the limited capacity of deep learning techniques to delineate visual objects. To solve this problem, we introduce a new form of convolutional neural network that combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)-based probabilistic graphical modelling. To this end, we formulate Conditional Random Fields with Gaussian pairwise potentials and mean-field approximate inference as Recurrent Neural Networks. This network, called CRF-RNN, is then plugged in as a part of a CNN to obtain a deep network that has desirable properties of both CNNs and CRFs. Importantly, our system fully integrates CRF modelling with CNNs, making it possible to train the whole deep network end-to-end with the usual back-propagation algorithm, avoiding offline post-processing methods for object delineation. We apply the proposed method to the problem of semantic image segmentation, obtaining top results on the challenging Pascal VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": "1502.03240",

Along with fuel and ignition characteristics, climatic conditions are seen as one of the main drivers of fire regimes. Projected changes in climate are expected to significantly influence fire regimes in Canada. As fire regime greatly shapes large-scale patterns in biodiversity, carbon, and vegetation, as well as forest and fire management strategies, it becomes necessary to define regions where current and future fire regimes are homogeneous. Random Forests (RF) modeling was used to relate fire regime attributes prevailing between 1961 and 1990 in eastern Canada with climatic/fire-weather and environmental variables. Using climatic normals outputs from the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM), we delineated current (1961-1990) and future (2011-2040, 2040-2070, 2071 2100) homogeneous fire regime (HFR) zones. Heterogeneous response of fire regime to climate changes is projected for eastern Canada with some areas (e.g., western Quebec) experiencing very small alterations while others (e.g., southeastern Ontario) are facing great shifts. Overall, models predicted a 2.2- and 2.4-fold increase in the number of fires and the annual area burned respectively mostly as a result of an increase in extreme fire-weather normals and mean drought code. As extreme fire danger would occur later in the fire season on average, the fire season would shift slightly later (5-20 days) in the summer for much of the study area while remaining relatively stable elsewhere. Although fire regime values would change significantly over time, most zone boundaries would remain relatively stable. The information resulting from HFR zonations is clearly of interest for forest and fire management agencies as it reveals zones with peculiar fire regimes that would have been hidden otherwise using predefined administrative or ecological stratifications.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "23865239", "doi": "10.1890/12-0698.1", "venue": "Ecological applications : a publication of the Ecological Society of America", "journal": "Ecological applications : a publication of the Ecological Society of America", "mag_id": "2128506016", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["17396550", "73713805", "16892781", "5288252", "134811489", "1940141", "54639962", "2815123", "18808239", "21255764", "1815578", "91599379", "13978271", "6765143", "3553716", "87712535", "71147389", "203585455", "130825513", "59156194", "40636313", "153871059", "11820319", "153999748", "214943066", "91369258"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11161132"}

Caspases appear to be involved in the molecular pathology of NDs by directly cleaving important proteins. For instance, several proteins involved in Alzheimer's disease, including \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilins, are known to be cleaved by caspases. Therefore, cell death pathway may play a central role in many neurological diseases, and targeting the important proteins that control the cell survival and death may potentially represent a therapeutic approach for chronic neurodegenerative disorders. ::: ::: ::: FINDINGS ::: We developed CaspNeuroD, a relational database of in silico predicted caspase cleavage sites in human proteins associated with NDs. The prediction has been done on collection of 249 human proteins reported in clinical studies of NDs using the recently published CaspDB Random Forest machine-learning model. This database could be used for identifying new caspase substrates and further our understanding of the caspase-mediated substrate cleavage in NDs. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Our database provides information about potential caspase cleavage sites in a verified set of human proteins involved in NDs. It provides also information about the conservation of cleavage positions in corresponding orthologs, and information about the positions of single nucleotide polymorphisms and posttranslational modifications (PTMs) that may modulate the caspase cleavage efficiency.Database URL: caspdb.sanfordburnham.org/caspneurod.php.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5199200", "pubmed_id": "28025335", "doi": "10.1093/database/baw142", "venue": "Database: The Journal of Biological Databases and Curation", "journal": "Database: The Journal of Biological Databases and Curation", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2565927369", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["152553", "8738190", "11928561", "935034", "79164453", "12251113", "20010832", "25402829", "10673710", "10925927", "22852945", "5572725", "24110192", "23918104", "8154175", "21966287", "2158179", "8603554", "43480246", "54468358", "14497652", "14076525", "11801091", "3980907", "17571298", "25171073", "1246355", "11716965", "46191693", "1603684", "16509924", "16458993", "54549832"], "inbound_citations": ["24459750"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11164429"}

In this paper, we present a novel method for modeling a dynamic scene, i.e. scenes that contain \u201cnon-stationary\u201d background motions, such as periodic motions (e.g. pendulums or escalators) or dynamic textures (e.g. water fountain in the background, swaying trees, or water ripples etc).

The objective of this study was to build an effective predictive model with high sensitivity and selectivity to better identify Canadian patients at risk of having Diabetes Mellitus based on patient demographic data and the laboratory results during their visits to medical facilities. Using the most recent records of 13,309 Canadian patients aged between 18 and 90 years, along with their laboratory information (age, sex, fasting blood glucose, body mass index, high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein), we built predictive models using Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) techniques. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AROC) was used to evaluate the discriminatory capability of these models. We used the adjusted threshold method and the class weight method to improve sensitivity \u2013 the proportion of Diabetes Mellitus patients correctly predicted by the model. We also compared these models to other learning machine techniques such as Decision Tree and Random Forest. The AROC for the proposed GBM model is 84.7% with a sensitivity of 71.6% and the AROC for the proposed Logistic Regression model is 84.0% with a sensitivity of 73.4%. The GBM and Logistic Regression models perform better than the Random Forest and Decision Tree models. The ability of our model to predict patients with Diabetes using some commonly used lab results is high with satisfactory sensitivity. These models can be built into an online computer program to help physicians in predicting patients with future occurrence of diabetes and providing necessary preventive interventions. The model is developed and validated on the Canadian population which is more specific and powerful to apply on Canadian patients than existing models developed from US or other populations.

In this paper, similarity learning is investigated from the perspective of pairwise bipartite ranking, where the goal is to rank the elements of a database by decreasing order of the probability that they share the same label with some query data point, based on the similarity scores. A natural performance criterion in this setting is pointwise ROC optimization: maximize the true positive rate under a fixed false positive rate. We study this novel perspective on similarity learning through a rigorous probabilistic framework. The empirical version of the problem gives rise to a constrained optimization formulation involving U-statistics, for which we derive universal learning rates as well as faster rates under a noise assumption on the data distribution.

The general approach is to rely on linguistic information at various levels, including lexical, lexico-semantic, and syntactic. The approach starts by mapping texts onto structured representations that include lexical, lexico-semantic, and syntactic information. The representation is then used as input to methods designed to measure the semantic similarity between texts based on the available linguistic information. While world knowledge is needed to properly assess semantic similarity of texts, in our approach world knowledge is not used, which is a weakness of it. We limit ourselves to answering the question of how successfully one can measure the semantic similarity of texts using just linguistic information. The lexical information in the original texts is retained by using the words in the corresponding representations of the texts. Syntactic information is encoded using dependency relations trees, which represent explicitly the syntactic relations between words. Word-level semantic information is relatively encoded through the use of semantic similarity measures like WordNet Similarity or explicitly encoded using vectorial representations such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). Several methods are being studied to compare the representations, ranging from simple lexical overlap, to more complex methods such as comparing semantic representations in vector spaces as well as syntactic structures. Furthermore, a few powerful kernel models are proposed to use in combination with Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers for the case in which the semantic similarity problem is modeled as a classification task.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2213311226", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["52248061", "5630662"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:124727581"}

New optical imaging systems are becoming available which can acquire high-resolution data on the abun- dance and biomass of plankton taxa. The Video Plankton Recorder (VPR) has been designed and used for automatic sampling and visualization of major planktonic taxa at sea in real time, providing high-resolution data over a broad range of scales. Although these optical systems produce digital images of plankton that can be automatically identified by computer, the limited accuracy of auto- matic classification methods can reduce confidence in subsequent abundance estimates, especially in areas where a taxon is in low relative abundance. This paper describes an improved classification system for automatic identification of plankton taxa from digital images. Classifiers are trained from a set of images that were classified by human experts. The data set used to verify the classification system contains over 20 000 planktonic images manually sorted into 7 different categories. The new method uses co-occurrence matrices (COM) as the feature, and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the classifier. This new method is compared against a previous plankton recognition system, which used moment invariants, Fourier descriptors and granulometry as features and a learning vector quantization neural network as a classifier. The new method reduced the classification error rate from 39 to 28%. Subsequent plankton abundance estimates are improved by more than 50% in regions of low relative abundance. In general, the reduction in classification error was due to a combination of the use of COM and SVM.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3354/meps295021", "venue": null, "journal": "Marine Ecology Progress Series", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1982964233", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["9790719", "129751756", "128821650", "194951", "5934464", "55238399", "210609477", "27002000", "129178528", "55881900", "47109072", "126814056", "128608192", "86449219", "129733918", "85406343", "84942361", "29648250", "85791913", "5753787", "82608834", "128817871", "84318378", "108749433", "83637860", "62151330", "6938271", "17873583", "55437022", "9628563"], "inbound_citations": ["21612056", "213987433", "5984713", "59438870", "15551069", "195880219", "16877865", "9060540", "12471608", "53367453", "133986936", "211133557", "20172241", "215212896", "15989560", "54454942", "199070176", "2489399", "84144789", "28334029", "53978989", "46100813", "201779970", "55820204", "13685436", "14312049", "18434083", "7900085", "10167628", "23654913", "16953708", "56061270"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18469864"}

It also utilizes expert knowledge concerning the monotonic relations between the response and predictor variables, which is represented in the form of monotonicity constraints. We formulate the classification problem of a monotonically constrained fuzzy SVM, called a monotonic FSVM, derive its dual optimization problem, and theoretically analyze its monotonic property. The Tikhonov regularization method is further applied to ensure that the solution is unique and bounded. A new measure, i.e., the frequency monotonicity rate, is proposed to evaluate the ability of the model to retain the monotonicity.

Inspired by human transitive inference and learning ability, whereby two seemingly unrelated concepts can be connected by a string of intermediate bridges using auxiliary concepts, in this paper we study a novel learning problem: Transitive Transfer Learning (abbreviated to TTL). TTL is aimed at breaking the large domain distances and transfer knowledge even when the source and target domains share few factors directly. For example, when the source and target domains are documents and images respectively, TTL could use some annotated images as the intermediate domain to bridge them. To solve the TTL problem, we propose a learning framework to mimic the human learning process.

{"paper_id": "117597516", "title": "Simulation of a mobile robot tracking a free rolling ball", "authors": [{"first": "Tomas", "middle": [], "last": "Rapcan", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "There are two computational paradigms in Artificial intelligence (AI). The first is a sub-symbolic (connectionist) and the second is a symbolic approach. Connectionist approach is based on neural networks and it is mostly used for cognitive simulations. Symbolic approach in fact represents a complementary approach to connectionism in many aspects. ::: This project describes an implementation of an experiment in which a virtual mobile robot tracks (follows) a free rolling ball using Radial Basis Function (RBF) network based controller. Motivation is influenced by effort to program simply and effective model. The project is split into four parts. ::: In the first part we have compared connectionist approach with one realization of the symbolic approach which is based on the following algorithms: transformation of input projection of mobile robot to gray scale, finding edges of objects (methods used to locate changes in the intensity function; edges are pixels where this function (brightness) changes abruptly), thresholding (is used to determine objects segment and background), finding a gravitational center of the ball (Hough transformation - problem of finding object of known size and shape within an image) and finally generating a command for the wheels. The main disadvantage of this approach is that one has to develop and apply all the needed algorithms and Hough transformation is very computing expensive method. ::: The goal of the second part was to create a simple 3D environment with a ball, a robot and a environment (playground). Robot's body is represented by a blue block with red stripe on the front side. Its movement is represented by changing position of the camera. Camera resolution is 150 x 100 (width x height) pixels. The ball's position is controlled by the keyboard. Also, there is a possibility to use a random movement generator for automatic navigation of the ball. Output data from camera are simplified for RBF network by two types of preprocessing: - transformation to gray scale and ::: - thresholding. ::: The third part is an implementation of hybrid feedforward RBF neuron network. In feedforward network, the information moves in only one direction, forward, from the input neurons, through the hidden neurons (if any) and to the output neurons. ::: RBF network is composed of three layers of units with different roles. ::: The input layer is made up from sensory units, which receive visual information from the environment captured by camera. Each sensory unit has its own local (radial) receptive field (RF). In this case we have used RF with radius 8 pixels for each sensory unit. This RF is in immediate contact with environment. For defined size of robot perspective (150 x 100 pixels) is used 150 (15 x 10) RF with small overlaps and respect to their position. There are a few possible strategies for placement of the RF centers but we have chosen a manual selection - equidistantly distributed over the input space. ::: The next hidden layer represents neurons with radial basis function. Parameters of these units imply the specification of input layer (each hidden neuron has assigned one RF). These neurons are able to recognize changing of input data from camera in their RF. Possible activation for these neurons are in range of where 0 represent no activation and 1 represent the highest activation. Shiny pixels in whole RF of one neuron cause the highest activation. ::: The output layer is a linearly weighted sum of the outputs of hidden units. This layer consists of five output neurons. There is one neuron for each possible action (left, right, forward, backward, no action). The highest activation of one of the neurons is taken as the activation of the winner. Action assigned to winner neuron is performed in playground. ::: After implementation RBF network were trained by supervised learning. Robot's actual position after each actions in the playground is evaluated by an algorithm with the following rules: if the ball is too far away from the robot - both wheels go forward, if the ball is too close - both wheels go backward, if the ball is on the left side - right wheel goes forward and left goes backward and if the ball is on the right side - left wheel goes forward and right goes backward. ::: The fourth part of the project presents the results of testing, the model effectiveness with respect to movement speed of the ball and the robot and the level of noise in input data. Noise is represented by using different textures on the surface of the ball and the playground (walls, floor) and by \"killed\" neurons in hidden layer. Comparison of effectiveness with respect to different conditions, especially with higher level of noise has shown decrease of successfulness rate. ::: ::: References: ::: [1]HAYKIN S.: Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation, Prentice Hall. 2005. ::: [2]SONKA, M., HLAVAC, V., BOYLE, R.: Image Processing, Analysis, and Machine Vision. 2008. ::: [3]YILMAZ, A., JAVED, O.

The regressors on the other hand learn a mapping between the appearance of the area surrounding a point and the positions of these points, which makes detection of the points very fast and can make the algorithm robust to variations of appearance due to facial expression and moderate changes in head pose. The proposed point detection algorithm was tested on 1855 images, the results of which showed we outperform current state of the art point detectors.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539996", "venue": "2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "journal": "2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2116277445", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2230657", "5334393", "11131159", "2127929", "16351332", "16460653", "2274476", "6131848", "15752506", "5071426", "209052153", "6290542", "17779599", "12233377", "18413676", "207180759", "10451129", "306118", "16701418"], "inbound_citations": ["204824422", "24348", "12490455", "14729447", "13033062", "15995707", "13578921", "12643673", "18897889", "31156034", "29105297", "17927094", "14005437", "6366253", "14029741", "20571430", "54436382", "211069261", "11076858", "2619724", "15574929", "13429243", "5632642", "17494161", "12681514", "16286760", "8708995", "3995227", "29342607", "51612951", "3475382", "3126940", "1723366", "3707477", "5783965", "62043041", "14983535", "685273", "14474212", "22155668", "2901726", "14720441", "15033938", "46355867", "1153220", "53568685", "16016518", "1477208", "5961731", "52832798", "641127", "5816782", "7215860", "24049912", "17198540", "1776451", "58003883", "8153583", "12177709", "13913555", "6064403", "9030759", "569358", "11503173", "12936462", "11990523", "13974290", "1042796", "653594", "48970", "204927862", "9627493", "11382919", "1115578", "77375248", "209459477", "20240727", "23634718", "16019183", "16086108", "195440503", "1534079", "1230649", "13663217", "17709485", "15831630", "12118037", "167618", "14977924", "6368467", "36943494", "9343637", "17221751", "29199694", "16934229", "17857585", "8032038", "39997227", "14439662", "215721", "145290", "19461660", "15396940", "206849289", "52984300", "31904944", "40989667", "3279577", "13689658", "2114941", "9070142", "10022821", "6852885", "201698144", "214962302", "4639774", "119667371", "46878789", "12699271", "21893111", "1395808", "14181993", "54461542", "12221604", "6129491", "53082381", "27464635", "58669999", "7185443", "16729193", "12455531", "37788164", "199440725", "1267739", "18543653", "13833952", "16378730", "14974441", "52931217", "115226221", "209140200", "1131260", "13877746", "16273035", "289710", "17026177", "17665539", "18341685", "637994", "2752739", "35550727", "7877172", "15468080", "10544765", "893855", "893855", "2854212", "6438156", "18984680", "546229", "18038464", "33323106", "8323773", "15797217", "8065521", "5699550", "17778540", "11630974", "19377653", "202122634", "52058469", "6191928", "16010181", "19833076", "206651773", "6447099", "36990054", "17675624", "17675624", "17968309", "9003598", "3351622", "6383512", "26158136", "253886", "15698086", "16884762", "53595624", "3782116", "11394754", "32526561", "6879376", "2557936", "10765877", "159036240", "209405315", "69223905", "18496493", "53477256", "12528622", "15565372", "5896189", "44334947", "7973714", "67856523", "15133645", "7263634", "12627049", "71151527", "9290096", "12963130", "3333130", "1271680", "1215393", "6710165", "5976242"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15680032"}

Only a small subset of the DCT coefficients is retained by truncating high frequency DCT components in each block. Selected DCT features are then subjected to SVM for class separability enhancement before being used for face recognition. This leads to a new, low-dimensional representation of images which allows for a fast and simple classification.

While many vision-based datasets have been released in the recent years, ones involving physical interactions, of particular interest for the robotic community, have been scarcer. In this paper, we present a public dataset on peg-in-hole insertion tasks containing force-torque and pose information for multiple variations of convex-shaped pegs. We demonstrate how this dataset can be used to train a robot to insert polyhedral pegs into holes using only 6-axis force/torque sensor measurements as inputs, as well as other tasks involving contact such as shape recognition.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1807.06749", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2884615100", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["6263888", "15870937", "502946", "15928602", "18347236", "1221830", "43138965"], "inbound_citations": ["207978000", "67856672"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49863162"}

We used the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) to evaluate the predictive performance via ten-fold cross validation. ::: ::: ::: Results ::: Five hundred nineteen patients who underwent transplantation from January 2015 to December 2018 were included. Forty-three severe pneumonia episodes (8.3%) occurred during hospitalization after surgery. Significant differences in the recipients' age, diabetes status, HBsAg level, operation time, reoperation, usage of anti-fungal drugs, preoperative albumin and immunoglobulin levels, preoperative pulmonary lesions, and delayed graft function, as well as donor age, were observed between patients with and without severe pneumonia (P<0.05).

Its generation is subject to topographic controls at differing spatial scales. Our objective was to identify such controls on the occurrence of overland flow in a lowland tropical rainforest. To this end, we installed 95 overland flow detectors (OFDs) in four nested subcatchments of the Lutzito catchment on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, and monitored the frequency of overland flow occurrence during 18 rainfall events at each OFD location temporal frequency. For each such location, we derived three non-digital terrain attributes and 17 digital ones, of which 15 were based on Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of three different resolutions. These attributes then served as input into a Random Forest ensemble tree model to elucidate the importance and partial and joint dependencies of topographic controls for overland flow occurrence. Lutzito features a high median temporal frequency in overland flow occurrence of 0.421 among OFD locations. However, spatial temporal frequencies of overland flow occurrence vary strongly among these locations and the subcatchments of Lutzito catchment. This variability is best explained by (1) microtopography, (2) coarse terrain sloping and (3) various measures of distance-to-channel, with the contribution of all other terrain attributes being small. Microtopographic features such as concentrated flowlines and wash areas produce highest temporal frequencies, whereas the occurrence of overland flow drops sharply for flow distances and terrain sloping beyond certain threshold values. Our study contributes to understanding both the spatial controls on overland flow generation and the limitations of terrain attributes for the spatially explicit prediction of overland flow frequencies.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jhydrol.2011.08.002", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Hydrology", "mag_id": "2038275650", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["130093371", "132845247", "202699044", "53071847", "155980866", "129311094", "157193221", "96429293", "88511391", "55803934", "16882190"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:129310769"}

Electrocardiogram (ECG) supervising is the most important and efficient way of preventing heart attacks. Machine monitoring and analysis of ECG is becoming a major topic of the modern medical research. In this paper, we propose a system to detect cardiac arrhythmia using the ECG data form MIT-BIH database as a reference. The purpose of this paper is to develop an algorithm for recognizing and classifying normal beat, left bundle branch block beat, right bundle branch block beat and premature ventricular contraction (PVC). In order to do so, we extract more than 6000 signals from the original database, each signal representing a single and complete heart beat. We extract the principal characteristics of the signal by means of the principal component analysis (PCA) technique.

Given that recent architectural innovations are mostly new word interaction layers or attention-based matching mechanisms, it seems to be a well-established fact that these components are mandatory for good performance. Unfortunately, the memory and computation cost incurred by these complex mechanisms are undesirable for practical applications. As such, this paper tackles the question of whether it is possible to achieve competitive performance with simple neural architectures. We propose a simple but novel deep learning architecture for fast and efficient question-answer ranking and retrieval. More specifically, our proposed model, HyperQA, is a parameter efficient neural network that outperforms other parameter intensive models such as Attentive Pooling BiLSTMs and Multi-Perspective CNNs on multiple QA benchmarks. The novelty behind HyperQA is a pairwise ranking objective that models the relationship between question and answer embeddings in Hyperbolic space instead of Euclidean space. This empowers our model with a self-organizing ability and enables automatic discovery of latent hierarchies while learning embeddings of questions and answers. Our model requires no feature engineering, no similarity matrix matching, no complicated attention mechanisms nor over-parameterized layers and yet outperforms and remains competitive to many models that have these functionalities on multiple benchmarks.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3159652.3159664", "venue": "WSDM '18", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2775696384", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16815193", "6749682", "429631", "14163772", "538820", "8699362", "7413367", "16787742", "279533", "1915014", "4497054", "11845175", "6451908", "2407601", "16657628", "25418227", "8495258", "1957433", "17562582", "14602160", "3356807", "8076932", "207218382", "6185314", "6201557", "19894963", "10761261", "646109", "1373518", "14644892", "10402642", "12211448", "6423645"], "inbound_citations": ["57190516", "204939091", "43968607", "166228062", "58876953", "48360418", "52011884", "203605232", "203605510", "211560334", "4753193", "209336596", "174773500", "52171583", "166228055", "54445839", "174800785", "202769115", "214595806", "81975853", "207794170", "208268313", "212414947", "53082203", "210931571", "58024156", "159040991", "202539403", "208145292", "174804052", "54447613", "215416034", "50776910", "46928795", "202784587"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:207603084"}

For most models, the selection of time lag is a crucial factor affecting the forecasting performance. Instead of choosing a single time lag when constructing model, in this paper, we propose a novel approach attempting to construct multiple base forecasting models, each with different time lag and performance. Least squares support vector regression (LSSVR) with the Gaussian kernel function is adopted as the base model because of its nonlinear modeling capability, as well as empirical performance. Then, the outputs of these base models are integrated to produce final prediction through another LSSVR with the linear kernel function. This ensemble forecasting framework consists of many parameters that need to be adjusted. To address this issue, an improved harmony search algorithm tailored for our forecasting system is further developed for seeking the optimal parameters.

To combat HIV replication in an infected individual, anti-retroviral therapies (ARTs) have been designed to target essential proteins in the replication cycle of HIV. The replication cycle is comprised of several steps. To successfully enter a cell, the viral gp120 protein first binds to its primary cellular CD4 receptor protein. This induces a series of conformational changes in the gp120 protein, enabling the virus to bind either to the CCR5 or CXCR4 coreceptor1. After, virus-cell membrane fusion occurs and the viral entry process is complete. Based on the coreceptor type, HIV exhibits different tropisms. HIV usually requires CCR5 to facilitate primary infection2, but approximately half of infected individuals will switch to CXCR4 usage, which is generally associated with an accelerated decline in the CD4+ cell count and rapid disease progression3,4. Only one CCR5 inhibitor \u2013Maraviroc \u2013 has been licensed for use in the antiretroviral treatment due to the severity of side effects from other cellular receptor blocker candidates5. Its long-term efficacy depends on the HIV\u2019s utilization of the CCR5 coreceptor. Consequently, identifying the specific coreceptor usage is essential for effective drug intervention. ::: ::: Viral coreceptor tropism can be determined in vitro by phenotypic assays6,7. However, due to complicated laboratory work and slow processing times, we need to develop simpler, faster, cheaper and more accessible in silico procedures to measure dynamic coreceptor usage. Genotypic tropism prediction methods are usually based on the third variable loop (V3)8,9 of the viral glycoprotein gp120, which has been identified as an important determinant for coreceptor usage8,10. The V3 loop is a highly variable sequence that includes amino acid (AA) deletions, insertions, and mutations, even a single amino acid change in V3 loop could switch the tropism11,12. Generally, CXCR4-tropic V3 sequences have a higher charge, a lower sequence identity (higher genetic diversity among CXCR4-tropic sequences), and a longer sequence13 from which genotypic models derive sequence features. The first model developed for inferring coreceptor usage is called the 11/25 rule, which classifies the virus as having CXCR4 tropism if a positively charged amino acid is observed in positions 11 or 25 of the V3 sequence14. This simple approach can be easily carried out, but has a low sensitivity (a CXCR4-tropic virus can be incorrectly characterized as CCR5-tropic), making it unsuitable for routine clinical use. More sophisticated methods have been developed, such as methods based on Support Vector Machine (SVMs)15,16,17, Position-Specific Weight Matrix (PSSM)18 and artificial neural networks19. Although these machine learning based methods yielded higher accuracies on coreceptor tropism identification compared to the 11/25 rule, they do not explore genetic mutations associated with tropism switch. ::: ::: Here, we present a reliable model comprised of two coreceptor specific weight matrices (CMs). The tropism of a new V3 sequence is determined based on scores calculated from these two CMs. By grouping the sequences based on scores derived from CMs and performing a large-scale pattern analysis across these groups, we were able to identify key mutational pattern pairs involved in coreceptor switch.

We propose ScarGAN to simulate scar tissue on healthy myocardium using chained generative adversarial networks (GAN).

Unlike other approaches that generate samples from scratch, we simulate scar tissue on normal scans resulting in highly realistic samples.

Because patients with MCI often progress to Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the VPC may be useful in predicting the onset of AD. VPC uses noninvasive eye tracking to identify how subjects view novel and repeated visual stimuli. Healthy control subjects demonstrate memory for the repeated stimuli by spending more time looking at the novel images, i.e., novelty preference. Here, we report an application of machine learning methods from computer science to improve the accuracy of detecting MCI by modeling eye movement characteris- tics such as fixations, saccades, and re-fixations during the VPC task. These characteristics are represented as features provided to automatic classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Using the SVM classification algorithm, in tandem with modeling the patterns of fixations, saccade orientation, and regression patterns, our algorithm was able to automatically distinguish age-matched normal control subjects from MCI subjects with 87% accuracy, 97% sensitivity and 77% specificity, compared to the best available classification performance of 67% accuracy, 60% sensitivity, and 73% specificity when using only the novelty preference information. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of applying machine- learning techniques to the detection of MCI, and suggest a promising approach for detection of cognitive impairments associated with other disorders. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we propose an efficient SISR method via learning hybrid residual features, based on which the residual HR image can be reconstructed. To fulfill hybrid residual feature learning, we propose a compact back-projection network that can simultaneously generate features in both LR and HR space by cascading up-and down-sampling layers with small-sized filters.

Building a decoder that simultaneously addresses these three criteria is complicated because optimizing for one criterion may lead to undesirable changes in the other criteria.

We utilized historical intracortical recordings from a human tetraplegic study participant, who imagined performing several different hand and finger movements. For both decoders, we found that response time increases (i.e. slower reaction) and accuracy decreases as the number of functions increases. However, we also found that both the increase of response times and the decline in accuracy with additional functions is less for the DNN than the SVM. We also show that data preprocessing steps can affect the performance characteristics of the two decoders in drastically different ways. Finally, we evaluated the performance of our tetraplegic participant using the DNN decoder in real-time to control functional electrical stimulation (FES) of his paralyzed forearm.

In this paper, we put forward prior Latent Dirichlet Allocation (prior LDA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) based fault diagnosis.

For example, idiopathic hyposmia (IH), which is a reduced olfactory sensitivity, is typical in >95% of PD patients and is a preclinical marker for the pathology. Methods In this work, a wearable inertial device, named SensHand V1, was used to acquire motion data from the upper limbs during the performance of six tasks selected by MDS-UPDRS III. Three groups of people were enrolled, including 30 healthy subjects, 30 IH people, and 30 PD patients. Forty-eight parameters per side were computed by spatiotemporal and frequency data analysis. A feature array was selected as the most significant to discriminate among the different classes both in two-group and three-group classification. Multiple analyses were performed comparing three supervised learning algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Naive Bayes, on three different datasets. Results Excellent results were obtained for healthy vs. patients classification (F-Measure 0.95 for RF and 0.97 for SVM), and good results were achieved by including subjects with hyposmia as a separate group (0.79 accuracy, 0.80 precision with RF) within a three-group classification. Overall, RF classifiers were the best approach for this application. Conclusion The system is suitable to support an objective PD diagnosis. Further, combining motion analysis with a validated olfactory screening test, a two-step non-invasive, low-cost procedure can be defined to appropriately analyze people at risk for PD development, helping clinicians to identify also subtle changes in motor performance that characterize PD onset.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30826265", "doi": "10.1016/j.parkreldis.2019.02.028", "venue": "Parkinsonism & related disorders", "journal": "Parkinsonism & related disorders", "mag_id": "2916783115", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["204229693", "201068807", "209331401"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:73502250"}

Additionally, the impact of false absences, i.e. data records of suitable vector habitat that are, for various reasons, incorrectly labelled as absent, on the model outcome was assessed using alternative calibration-validation schemes. Three reduction methods were applied to reduce the number of false absences in the calibration data, without loss of information on the environmental gradient of suitable vector habitat: random reduction and stratified reduction based on the distance between absence and presence records in geographical (Euclidean distance) or environmental space (Mahalanobis distance). The results indicated that the predicted vector distribution by the Random Forest model was significantly more accurate than the vector distributions predicted by the two established models (McNemar test, p<0.01) when the calibration data were not reduced with respect to false absences.

Musical genres are the main top-level descriptors used to organize digital music files. Most of work in labeling genre done manually. Thus, an automatic way for labeling a genre to digital music files is needed. The most standard approach to do automatic musical genre classification is feature extraction followed by supervised machine-learning. This research aims to find the best combination of audio features using several kernels of non-linear Support Vector Machines (SVM). The 31 different combinations of proposed audio features are dissimilar compared in any other related research. Furthermore, among the proposed audio features, Linear Predictive Coefficients (LPC) has not been used in another works related to musical genre classiffication. LPC was originally used for speech coding. An experimentation in classifying digital music file into a genre is carried out. The experiments are done by extracting feature sets related to timbre, rhythm, tonality and LPC from music files.

Secondary screening algorithm exploits different query functions, which are on the basis of the evaluation of two criteria: uncertainty and diversity. The advantage of semisupervised learning is that with a small number of samples, classifiers could learn the structure of whole data sets without significant costs and efforts. Hence, combining secondary screening algorithm and semisupervised learning is a natural consideration. We firstly investigate nine secondary screening algorithms and compare their performance. Next, two novel frameworks are proposed in this paper.

This characterization can be now provided by the novel Earth Observation tools. This study aims to contribute to understanding the innovation in forest and ecological research that can be brought in by advanced remote sensing instruments, and proposes the guild mapping approach as a tool to efficiently monitor the varied tropical forest resources. We evaluated, in tropical Ghanaian forests, the ability of airborne hyperspectral and simulated multispectral Sentinel-2 data, and derived vegetation indices and textures, to: distinguish between two different forest types; to discriminate among selected dominant species; and to separate trees species grouped according to their functional guilds: Pioneer, Non Pioneer Light Demanding, and Shade Bearer. We then produced guild classification maps for each area using hyperspectral data. Our results showed that with both hyperspectral and simulated Sentinel-2 data these discrimination tasks can be successfully accomplished. Results also stressed the importance of texture features, especially if using the lower spectral and spatial Sentinel-2 resolution data, and highlighted the important role of the new Sentinel-2 data for ecological monitoring. Classification results showed a statistically significant improvement in overall accuracy using Support Vector Machine, over Maximum Likelihood approach. We proposed the functional guilds mapping as an innovative approach to: (i) monitor compositional changes, especially with respect to the effects of global climate change on forests, and particularly in the tropical biome where the occurrence of hundreds of species prevents mapping activities at species level; (ii) support large-scale forest inventories.

Therefore scanning and processing the entire dataset for every query not only reduces the efficiency of the algorithm but at the same time minimizes the speed of processing. This can be solved significantly by identifying the intrinsic dimensionality of the data and applying the classification on the dataset corresponding to the intrinsic dataset only. Several algorithms have been proposed for identifying the intrinsic data dimensions and reducing the same. Once the dimension of the data is reduced, it affects the classification rate and classification rate may drop due to reduction in number of data points for decision. In this work we propose a unique technique for classifying the leukemia data by identifying and reducing the dimension of the training or knowledge dataset using Iterative process of Intrinsic dimensionality discovery and reduction using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) technique. Further the optimized data set is used to classify the given data using Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification. Results show that the proposed technique performs much better in terms of obtaining optimized data set and classification accuracy.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-81-322-1602-5_152", "venue": "SocProS", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2123036430", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["214692267", "3828011"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:32193702"}

The presence of noise in gene expression datasets has adverse effects on machine-learning techniques, such as supervised classification algorithms and feature selection techniques. Additionally, the identification of noise and its quantification are challenging tasks that require a proper mechanism to manage them in order to improve the performance of classifiers and feature selection methods. In this study, our motivation is to investigate the effects of class noise on the classification performance of various learners using multiple derived datasets with varying degrees of data quality and class imbalance. Class imbalance is another challenging characteristic that occurs when one class has many more instances than the other class(es). To this end, we conducted experiments using a filter-based subset selection method applied to multiple derived datasets generated by injecting artificial class noise in a controlled manner creating three levels of data quality: High-Quality, Average-Quality, and Low-Quality. Our results along with statistical analysis show that Random Forest outperforms other learners without any exceptions for all levels of balance and data quality.

In this paper, we raise a fundamental question---do we have to trade off natural generalization for adversarial robustness? We argue that adversarial training is to employ confident adversarial data for updating the current model. We propose a novel approach of friendly adversarial training (FAT): rather than employing most adversarial data maximizing the loss, we search for least adversarial (i.e., friendly adversarial) data minimizing the loss, among the adversarial data that are confidently misclassified. Our novel formulation is easy to implement by just stopping the most adversarial data searching algorithms such as PGD (projected gradient descent) early, which we call early-stopped PGD. Theoretically, FAT is justified by an upper bound of the adversarial risk. Empirically, early-stopped PGD allows us to answer the earlier question negatively---adversarial robustness can indeed be achieved without compromising the natural generalization.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2002.11242", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3006834354", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3484983", "59842968", "3659467", "3655212", "49431481", "27716347", "214108145", "189856873", "6706414", "3488815", "44141172", "59222747", "174800190", "211548864", "15276198", "3310672", "2893830", "52962648", "604334", "873046", "59413836", "26714567", "10490694", "54064869", "53717167", "139102395", "146120969", "210164926", "173187842", "170079301", "173188378", "122379222", "206594692", "18268744", "16852518", "57375776", "53092122", "463216", "10898832"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211506760"}

The classification accuracy produced by SVM may show variation depending on the choice of training features. In this paper, SVM was used for land cover classification using Quickbird images. Spectral and textural features were extracted for the classification and the results were analyzed thoroughly. Results showed that the number of features employed in SVM was not the more the better. Different features are suitable for different type of land cover extraction.

We design a simple optimization method to find the optimal latent parameters corresponding to the closest generation to any input inspirational image. Specifically, we allow the generation given an inspirational image of the user choice by performing several optimization steps to recover optimal parameters from the model's latent space. We tested several exploration methods starting with classic gradient descents to gradient-free optimizers. Many gradient-free optimizers just need comparisons (better/worse than another image), so that they can even be used without numerical criterion, without inspirational image, but with only with human preference. Thus, by iterating on one's preferences we could make robust Facial Composite or Fashion Generation algorithms. High resolution of the produced design generations are obtained using progressive growing of GANs.

After the complete human genome sequence was published by Human Genome Project and Celera in 2001, there has been an explosion of research, shifting the NLU focus from domains like news articles to the domain of molecular biology and medical literature. BioNLU is needed, since there are almost 2000 new articles published and indexed every day, and the biologists need to know about existing knowledge regarding their own research. So far, BioNLU results are not as good as in other NLU domains, so more research is needed to solve the challenges of creating useful NLU applications for the biologists.The work in this PhD thesis is a \u201cproof of concept\u201d. It is the first to show that an existing Question Answering (QA) system can be successfully applied in the hard BioNLU domain, after the essential challenge of unknown entities is solved. The core contribution is a system that discovers and classifies unknown entities and relations between them automatically. The World Wide Web (through Google) is used as the main resource, and the performance is almost as good as other named entity extraction systems, but the advantage of this approach is that it is much simpler and requires less manual labor than any of the other comparable systems.The first paper in this collection gives an overview of the field of NLU and shows how the Information Extraction (IE) problem can be formulated with Local Grammars. The second paper uses Machine Learning to automatically recognize protein name based on features from the GSearch Engine. In the third paper, GSearch is substituted with Google, and the task in this paper is to extract all unknown names belonging to one of 273 biomedical entity classes, like genes, proteins, processes etc. After getting promising results with Google, the fourth paper shows that this approach can also be used to retrieve interactions or relationships between the named entities. The fifth paper describes an online implementation of the system, and shows that the method scales well to a larger set of entities.The final paper concludes the \u201cproof of concept\u201d research, and shows that the performance of the original GeneTUC NLU system has increased from handling 10% of the sentences in a large collection of abstracts in 2001, to 50% in 2006. This is still not good enough to create a commercial system, but it is believed that another 40% performance gain can be achieved by importing more verb templates into GeneTUC, just like nouns were imported during this work.

In order to reuse software several techniques and algorithm has been used such as Neural Network, Genetic Algorithm, Power Builder, and Support Vector Machine, Cyclometric complexity, Fuzzy logic, Hybrid genetic algorithm and fuzzy logic. This paper concerns the study of some of the techniques, design, approaches involved in software reuse. Reuse of software is a melioration crusade of the fecundity of the software systems. By the reusability the component can have better qualified, cheaper cost, improved performance. The reusable software component works better than the existing software as they are created with overcoming of the existing software module. The reusable software components are delivered within the shorter time. The major advantage of software reuse is it reduces the development time and cost, increases the software productivity, improves system interoperability, Provide more standardized system. Software reuse solves the several software crisis. In order to reuse a software system component technology is the important technology. Components are nothing but the smaller module which consist of classes and services which is defined in an application software system. Component form goes through the different form such as development, package, deployment and execution. Component assessment consists of various steps as find the component, verify the component, and finally store the component in the repository. Components are betrothed for reuse. Component Based software systems cogitate in decay of software system into function and logical component into distinct interface. This system hence the better maintainability of the software component. McClure has provided the technique to build the reusable component such as generalize, Standardize, Automate, certify, document. The approaches to evaluate the software reliability are qualitative, empirical relation of the component is described. As substantial manual effort is needed for the quantitative approach. This method is based on the attachment of prejudiced value. The empirical approach is based automatic collection of the objective data. Based on the following sections the section II concern with the CBS development process section III with approaches of reuse the section IV with design of the reuse system, section V with techniques and followed by conclusion in section. II. CBS DEVELOPMENT PROCESS Component Based Software Development process the software organization is split up into several categories based on the role: component developer, tool provider, environment provider component broker. The component developer who is responsible for dealing with the business logic. Developer requests the component from component repository the component broker in the middle help to select the appropriate component from the repository. Component broker evaluate and procure the component from the developer. After the selection of the component the tool provider which is nothing but the human or organization responsible for the creation, development, assembling and packaging tool .design develop the component with the tool. Then the environment provider which is an operating system, database, application or web server provides the environment to implement the tooled component. Then the role of software developer is to collect the source", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "International journal of engineering and technology", "mag_id": "2182545529", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["212649903", "62644648", "30751914"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14090957"}

Due to the ubiquitous existence of the ordering information in many practical cases, ordinal regression has received much attention and can be found in a great variety of applications. Meanwhile, Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM), as the extension of Extreme Learning Machine in the framework of kernel learning, has shown its strength in many machine learning tasks. Nevertheless, existing KELM methods have paid little attention to ordinal regression especially in large-scale situations. In this paper, we consider the kernel technique and ordinal scales in labels at the same time, and propose a new KELM model for ordinal regression by exploiting a quadratic cost-sensitive encoding scheme. In order to make the training process more efficient in the big data scenario, a fast algorithm is designed based on the low rank approximation. The incomplete Cholesky factorization and the Sherman\u2013Morrison\u2013Woodbury formula are utilized together to avoid computing the inverse of the kernel matrix. The time complexity of the new algorithm is thus linear with the number of the training instances, which makes it suitable to the large-scale occasions.

There are two major difficulties lying in this task: (1) The detection of human body parts and objects is usually affected by the quality of the videos, for instance, low resolutions of the videos, camera motions, and blurring frames caused by fast motions, as well as the self-occlusions during human-object interactions. (2) The spatial and temporal dynamics of human-object interaction are hard to model. In order to overcome those natural obstacles, we propose a new method using social network analysis (SNA) based features to describe the distributions and relationships of low level objects for human-object interaction recognition. In this approach, the detected human body parts and objects are treated as nodes in social network graphs, and a set of SNA features including closeness, centrality and centrality with relative velocity are extracted for action recognition. A major advantage of SNA based feature set is its robustness to varying node numbers and erroneous node detections, which are very common in human-object interactions. An SNA feature vector will be extracted for each frame and different human-object interactions are classified based on these features. Two classification methods, including Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM), have been used to evaluate the proposed feature set on four different human-object interactions from HMDB dataset [1].

Part of the reason for this may be akin to the motivation of the besotted gentleman on his hands and knees beneath a streetlamp, who, when queried as to why he is looking on the sidewalk for the keys he lost in the alley, replies: \"Because the light is better here!\" I believe it is time to start mucking about in the alley; the keys are there. I also think we have a new flashlight: Parallel Distributed Processing 2. PDP mechanisms allow us to build machines whose fundamental operations include best fit search, constraint relaxation and automatic generalization. These are useful properties for processing language. I think the application of these models to NLP will change our view of what constitutes \"semantics'. I will argue that in order to deal with meaning seriously, we have to move beyond the folkpsychological level of symbols, and represent the microstructure of symbols. This is more than a granularity issue. It also has to do with the grounding of meaning in perception. It is on the level of microfeatures that I believe this grounding occurs, and PDP gives us a way to express this interface between language and perception. My discussion of these issues will take the following course 3. First I describe my previous work on word sense disambiguation in a PDP framework as a springboard for the rest of the discussion, and to give a sense of how lexical semantics might fit into an overall parsing model.

The basis of these algorithms is the constructed graph which dictates their performance. In general, the graph is defined by the input affinity matrix.

To address this issue, we propose the projective unsupervised flexible embedding models with optimal graph (PUFE-OG). We build an optimal graph by adjusting the affinity matrix. To tackle the out-of-sample problem, we employ a linear regression term to learn a projection matrix. The optimal graph and the projection matrix are jointly learned by integrating the manifold regularizer and regression residual into a unified model.

Many biometric template protection methods have been reported in recent years, but most of them have a tradeoff between matching performance and template security. Some of these approaches also require re-enrollment in case the biometric templates are compromised. In this work, we propose a method for face template protection which improves the matching performance while providing high template security and also addresses the re-enrollment problem. Our approach relies on computing identity or class specific perturbations to the input facial feature vectors as a function of gradients of mapping network as in targeted adversarial learning. Further a cryptographic one-way hash function is applied on the target specific class labels and the hashes are stored as templates in database during enrollment. During verification, given an input face image of a user, the extracted facial features from Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) along with the pre-computed perturbations are used to predict the template and matched against the corresponding template of the user stored during enrollment. If any of the templates is compromised, it is revoked and a new set of perturbations for the corresponding user is computed with respect to the new target specific class label assigned to the user. The efficacy of the approach is evaluated on three face datasets, namely, CMU-PIE, FEI and Color-FERET. The proposed method achieves ~98% Genuine Accept Rate (GAR) at zero False Accept Rate (FAR).

METHOD: The trials included were initiated as early as June 1992, and the cutoff date for selection of the placebo-controlled trials in the Pfizer database was October 2, 2009. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-defined search methodology was used to identify possibly suicide-related adverse events, and the Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (primary outcome measure) was used to categorize them. The incidences of possibly suicide-related adverse events were calculated for individual classifications and for the predefined combined categories of suicidality (comprising classification codes 1-4) and suicidal behavior (comprising classification codes 1-3), along with the ziprasidone versus placebo relative risks and corresponding 95% CIs. Exact binomial 95% CIs were calculated for the individual treatment group incidences. RESULTS: Suicidality events were identified in 52 among 5,123 subjects treated with either ziprasidone or placebo in 22 trials. No cases of completed suicide occurred in this analysis. There were no statistically significant differences between ziprasidone and placebo in any of the individual classification categories, combined suicidal behavior category (ziprasidone vs placebo relative risk = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.206-2.201), or combined suicidality risk category (ziprasidone vs placebo relative risk = 0.90; 95% CI, 0.514-1.563). CONCLUSIONS: Results of our analyses, performed in accordance with the FDA-specified search strategy, reveal no significant differences in treatment-emergent suicidality risk in ziprasidone versus placebo subjects treated in controlled clinical trials.

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective foreground attentive neural network (FANN) to learn a discriminative feature representation for person Re-ID, which can adaptively enhance the positive side of foreground and weaken the negative side of background. Specifically, a novel foreground attentive subnetwork is designed to drive the network\u2019s attention, in which a decoder network is used to reconstruct the binary mask by using a novel local regression loss function, and an encoder network is regularized by the decoder network to focus its attention on the foreground persons. The resulting feature maps of encoder network are further fed into the body part subnetwork and feature fusion subnetwork to learn discriminative features. Besides, a novel symmetric triplet loss function is introduced to supervise feature learning, in which the intra-class distance is minimized and the inter-class distance is maximized in each triplet unit, simultaneously. Training our FANN in a multi-task learning framework, a discriminative feature representation can be learned to find out the matched reference to each probe among various candidates in the gallery.

An application of Gradient Boosting (GB) to predict insurance losses is outlined. ? GB shows higher predictive accuracy relative to the conventional GLM method. ? GB provides a suitable framework to build insurance pricing models. ? GB provides interpretable results, a desirable feature in a business environment. Gradient Boosting (GB) is an iterative algorithm that combines simple parameterized functions with \"poor\" performance (high prediction error) to produce a highly accurate prediction rule. In contrast to other statistical learning methods usually providing comparable accuracy (e.g., neural networks and support vector machines), GB gives interpretable results, while requiring little data preprocessing and tuning of the parameters. The method is highly robust to less than clean data and can be applied to classification or regression problems from a variety of response distributions (Gaussian, Bernoulli, Poisson, and Laplace). Complex interactions are modeled simply, missing values in the predictors are managed almost without loss of information, and feature selection is performed as an integral part of the procedure. These properties make GB a good candidate for insurance loss cost modeling. However, to the best of our knowledge, the application of this method to insurance pricing has not been fully documented to date. This paper presents the theory of GB and its application to the problem of predicting auto \"at-fault\" accident loss cost using data from a major Canadian insurer.

Recent reports clearly indicate that the volume of mobile phone spam is dramatically increasing year by year. In practice, fighting such plague is difficult by several factors, including the lower rate of SMS that has allowed many users and service providers to ignore the issue, and the limited availability of mobile phone spam-filtering software. Probably, one of the major concerns in academic settings is the scarcity of public SMS spam datasets, that are sorely needed for validation and comparison of different classifiers. Moreover, traditional content-based filters may have their performance seriously degraded since SMS messages are fairly short and their text is generally rife with idioms and abbreviations. In this paper, we present details about a new real, public and non-encoded SMS spam collection that is the largest one as far as we know. Moreover, we offer a comprehensive analysis of such dataset in order to ensure that there are no duplicated messages coming from previously existing datasets, since it may ease the task of learning SMS spam classifiers and could compromise the evaluation of methods. Additionally, we compare the performance achieved by several established machine learning techniques.

However, identifying objective biomarkers, prior to or early in the course of treatment that can predict antidepressant efficacy, remains a challenge. ::: ::: Methods: Individuals with MDD participated in a 12-week antidepressant pharmacotherapy trial. Electroencephalographic (EEG) data was collected before and 1 week post-treatment initiation in 51 patients. Response status at week 12 was established with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale (MADRS), with a \u226550% decrease characterizing responders (N = 27/24 responders/non-responders). We used a machine learning (ML)-approach for predicting response status. We focused on Random Forests, though other ML methods were compared. First, we used a tree-based estimator to select a relatively small number of significant features from: (a) demographic/clinical data (age, sex, individual item/total MADRS scores at baseline, week 1, change scores); (b) scalp-level EEG power; (c) source-localized current density (via exact low-resolution electromagnetic tomography [eLORETA] software). Second, we applied kernel principal component analysis to reduce and map important features. Third, a set of ML models were constructed to classify response outcome based on mapped features. For each dataset, predictive features were extracted, followed by a model of all predictive features, and finally by a model of the most predictive features. ::: ::: Results: Fifty eLORETA features were predictive of response (across bands, both time-points); alpha1/theta eLORETA features showed the highest predictive value. Eighty-eight scalp EEG features were predictive of response (across bands, both time-points), with theta/alpha2 being most predictive. Clinical/demographic data consisted of 31 features, with the most important being week 1 \u201cconcentration difficulty\u201d scores. When all features were included into one model, its predictive utility was high (88% accuracy). When the most important features were extracted in the final model, 12 predictive features emerged (78% accuracy), including baseline scalp-EEG frontopolar theta, parietal alpha2 and frontopolar alpha1. ::: ::: Conclusions: These findings suggest that ML models of pre- and early treatment-emergent EEG profiles and clinical features can serve as tools for predicting antidepressant response.

Specifically, we transform the test image into the appearance of source domain, with the semantic structural information being well preserved, which is achieved by imposing a nested adversarial learning in semantic label space. In this way, the segmentation DNN learned from the source domain is able to be directly generalized to the transformed test image, eliminating the need of training a new model for every new target dataset. Our domain adaptation procedure is unsupervised, without using any target domain labels. The adversarial learning of our network is guided by a GAN loss for mapping data distributions, a cycle-consistency loss for retaining pixel-level content, and a semantic-aware loss for enhancing structural information.

Proteins localized in these substructures are important to understand the interior nuclear mechanisms. Despite advances in high-throughput methods, experimental protein annotations remain limited. Predictions of cellular compartments have become very accurate, largely at the expense of leaving out substructures inside the nucleus making a fine-grained analysis impossible.ResultsHere, we present a new method (LocNuclei) that predicts nuclear substructures from sequence alone. LocNuclei used a string-based Profile Kernel with Support Vector Machines (SVMs). It distinguishes sub-nuclear localization in 13 distinct substructures and distinguishes between nuclear proteins confined to the nucleus and those that are also native to other compartments (traveler proteins). High performance was achieved by implicitly leveraging a large biological knowledge-base in creating predictions by homology-based inference through BLAST. Using this approach, the performance reached AUC = 0.70\u20130.74 and Q13 = 59\u201365%. Travelling proteins (nucleus and other) were identified at Q2 = 70\u201374%. A Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the enrichment of biological processes revealed that the predicted sub-nuclear compartments matched the expected functionality. Analysis of protein-protein interactions (PPI) show that formation of compartments and functionality of proteins in these compartments highly rely on interactions between proteins. This suggested that the LocNuclei predictions carry important information about function.

Homophily label propagation (i.e., two connected nodes share similar labels) in homogeneous graph (with same types of vertices and relations) has been extensively studied before. Unfortunately, real-life networks (e.g., social networks) are heterogeneous, they contain different types of vertices (e.g., users, images, texts) and relations (e.g., friendships, co-tagging) and allow for each node to propagate both the same and opposite copy of labels to its neighbors. We propose a K-partite label propagation model to handle the mystifying combination of heterogeneous nodes/relations and heterophily propagation. With this model, we develop a novel label inference algorithm framework with update rules in near-linear time complexity. Since real networks change over time, we devise an incremental approach, which supports fast updates for both new data and evidence (e.g., ground truth labels) with guaranteed efficiency. We further provide a utility function to automatically determine whether an incremental or a re-modeling approach is favored.

In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot classification approach that automatically learns label embeddings from the input data in a semi-supervised large-margin learning framework. The proposed framework jointly considers multi-class classification over all classes (observed and unseen) and tackles the target prediction problem directly without introducing intermediate prediction problems.

The monitoring of the operation condition is very important to reduce the downtime and improve the production efficiency. This paper presents a novel rotating machinery fault diagnosis method based on the improved multiscale amplitude-aware permutation entropy (IMAAPE) and the multiclass relevance vector machine (mRVM) to provide the necessary information for maintenance decisions. Once the fault occurs, the vibration amplitude and frequency of rotating machinery obviously changes and therefore, the vibration signal contains a considerable amount of fault information. In order to effectively extract the fault features from the vibration signals, the intrinsic time-scale decomposition (ITD) was used to highlight the fault characteristics of the vibration signal by extracting the optimum proper rotation (PR) component. Subsequently, the IMAAPE was utilized to realize the fault feature extraction from the PR component. In the IMAAPE algorithm, the coarse-graining procedures in the multi-scale analysis were improved and the stability of fault feature extraction was promoted. The coarse-grained time series of vibration signals at different time scales were firstly obtained, and the sensitivity of the amplitude-aware permutation entropy (AAPE) to signal amplitude and frequency was adopted to realize the fault feature extraction of coarse-grained time series. The multi-classifier based on the mRVM was established by the fault feature set to identify the fault type and analyze the fault severity of rotating machinery. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method, the experimental datasets of the rolling bearing and gearbox were used to verify the proposed fault diagnosis method respectively.

In the image classification field, deep learning technologies especially DCNNs are state-of-the-art technologies and have achieved remarkable success. But the requirements of high computation and storage resources prohibit the usages of DCNNs on resource-limited environments such as automatic harvesting robots. Therefore, we need to choose a lightweight neural network to achieve the balance of resource limitations and recognition accuracy. In this paper, a fruit image classification method based on a lightweight neural network MobileNetV2 with transfer learning technique was used to recognize fruit images. We used a MobileNetV2 network pre-trained by ImageNet dataset as a base network and then replace the top layer of the base network with a conventional convolution layer and a Softmax classifier. We applied dropout to the new-added conv2d at the same time to reduce overfitting. The pre-trained MobileNetV2 was used to extract features and the Softmax classifier was used to classify features. We trained this new model in two stages using Adam optimizer of different learning rate. This method finally achieved a classification accuracy of 85.12% in our fruit image dataset including 3670 images of 5 fruits. Compared with other network such as MobileNetV1, InceptionV3 and DenseNet121, this hybrid network implemented by Google open source deep learning framework Tensorflow can make a good compromise between accuracy and speed.

The proponents of this research analyzed the performance between two different methods. In the first method, the location of the joints of interest are tracked via the Cartesian coordinates of the joints while the second method tracks the location of the joints via spherical coordinates that includes normalization. Normalization is applied because the size and position of the user from the Kinect V2 may vary resulting to poor recognition.

In such case, the most suitable numbers of layers for the source domain data and the target domain data would differ. As a result, the high level knowledge from the source domain would be transferred to the wrong layer of target domain. Based on this observation, \u201cwhere to transfer\u201d proposed in this paper might be a novel research area. We propose a new mathematic model named DT-LET to solve this heterogeneous transfer learning problem. In order to select the best matching of layers to transfer knowledge, we define specific loss function to estimate the corresponding relationship between high-level features of data in the source domain and the target domain.

Commercial growers rely entirely on seed producers and certification systems to get disease-free seed as they have no recourse to mitigate seed-borne PVY after the seed is planted. Potato seed stock producers currently utilize intensive pesticide applications to suppress insect vectors and human-resource intensive activities where workers visually inspect and remove suspect infected plants during the growing season. Industry stakeholders also depend upon extensive field and tuber sampling coupled with off-season growouts and laboratory testing to ascertain infection levels within certification programs. Despite these efforts, seed producers and certification agencies are currently unable to control PVY infection in the industry\u2019s seed pipeline, and this has a significant impact on commercial markets and regional economies. The industry also lacks a consistent, scalable, accurate, and robust detection system capable of assessing every plant within the seed potato production agro-ecosystem during the production season. Remote sensing technologies coupled with machine learning classifiers are a significant leap forward in the detection and differentiation of plant disease incidence. The continuing advancement of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and unmanned ground vehicles provide access to high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution instrumentation with which to monitor dynamic agricultural production systems at a leaf-scale resolution. In this study, we demonstrate PVY-infected potato plants in an agricultural production field produce different spectral reflectance profiles in comparison to neighboring non-infected plants. The Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier differentiated spectral reflectance curves of PVY-infected and non-infected plants at an accuracy of 89.8% using near infrared and shortwave infrared wavelengths. The classification accuracy dropped to 46.9% using red, green, and blue wavelengths that the industry currently utilizes to detect diseased plants visually.

This success is due to the fact that MKL has the ability to choose from a variety of feature kernels to identify the optimal kernel combination. But the initial formulation of MKL was only able to select the best of the features and misses out many other informative kernels presented. To overcome this, the Lp norm based formulation was proposed by Kloft et. al. This formulation is capable of choosing a non-sparse set of kernels through a control parameter p. Unfortunately, the parameter p does not have a direct meaning to the number of kernels selected. We have observed that stricter control over the number of kernels selected gives us an edge over these techniques in terms of accuracy of classification and also helps us to fine tune the algorithms to the time requirements at hand. In this work, we propose a Controlled Sparsity Kernel Learning (CSKL) formulation that can strictly control the number of kernels which we wish to select. The CSKL formulation introduces a parameter t which directly corresponds to the number of kernels selected. It is important to note that a search in t space is finite and fast as compared to p. We have also provided an efficient Reduced Gradient Descent based algorithm to solve the CSKL formulation, which is proven to converge.

Four felicitous features are extracted by applying the Hilbert transform (HT) on the decomposed PQE signals. The synthetic, as well as practical PQE signals, are considered to test and examine the overall performance of the proposed method. OSELM is an efficient and advanced classifier which is implemented to recognize the single as well as multiple PQEs. The robust anti-noise performance, faster learning speed, lesser computational complexity, superior classification accuracy and short event detection time prove that the proposed VMD-OSELM method can be implemented in the electrical power system.

The quality of the predictions is robust to errors that unavoidably affect the stem regions when these are modeled.

Firstly, whether RF modeling can be used for the 3D MPM. The voxel (in 3D) has replaced the pixel (in 2D) to represent geological features, and so the capability of the RF model should be tested. Secondly, when we conduct regional-scale MPM, building a suitable conceptual model has a significant influence on the results; however, mineral deposit models often focus on just deposit-scale features. These two challenges were encountered in the case study in the Tongling ore cluster, which is the most representative skarn ore-concentrated area in the Middle\u2013Lower Yangtze River Valley Metallogenic Belt in Eastern China. Thus, 3D geological models of the Tongling ore cluster were constructed from the multiple geological datasets. Then, a conceptual model was translated into 3D predictor layers. Finally, we tested and compared the MPM capabilities of the RF and compared it with weights-of-evidence (WofE) modeling. The results indicate that RF modeling not only outperforms WofE modeling in 3D MPM, but it also has capability to assess the relative importance of different predictor layers. Further testing of this method is warranted in other areas with different scales or metallogenic model to investigate fully its efficiency.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11053-019-09578-2", "venue": "Natural Resources Research", "journal": "Natural Resources Research", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2982159501", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["121025150", "127003359", "55058842", "128503818", "135067565", "60993494", "207738357", "60993494", "89141", "140724144", "119992262", "129071685", "10895910", "127632303", "129410559", "18758621", "117914801", "121476616", "131436559", "62739295", "14079431", "129375649", "15000608", "131654868", "129114128", "129114128", "129868148", "140571867", "206381619", "130121044", "127824447", "62129475", "128730871", "1079964", "129907209", "131514886", "122872118", "9429600", "5262555", "129774903", "6336016", "122879482", "129238137", "128394531", "198410366", "129790880", "129921179", "133934661", "131501604", "130173027", "134852205", "12958071", "128400078"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204848763"}

The presence of T-cell and B-cell epitopes has been extensively studied due to their potential in synthetic vaccine design. However, reliable prediction of linear B-cell epitope remains a formidable challenge. Earlier studies have reported discrepancy in amino acid composition between the epitopes and non-epitopes. Hence, this study proposed and developed a novel amino acid composition-based feature descriptor, Dipeptide Deviation from Expected Mean (DDE), to distinguish the linear B-cell epitopes from non-epitopes effectively. In this study, for the first time, only exact linear B-cell epitopes and non-epitopes have been utilized for developing the prediction method, unlike the use of epitope-containing regions in earlier reports. To evaluate the performance of the DDE feature vector, models have been developed with two widely used machine-learning techniques Support Vector Machine and AdaBoost-Random Forest. Five-fold cross-validation performance of the proposed method with error-free dataset and dataset from other studies achieved an overall accuracy between nearly 61% and 73%, with balance between sensitivity and specificity metrics. Performance of the DDE feature vector was better (with accuracy difference of about 2% to 12%), in comparison to other amino acid-derived features on different datasets.

The experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the accuracy of prostate segmentation efficiently.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2991/icmmita-15.2015.75", "venue": "Proceedings of the 2015 3rd International Conference on Machinery, Materials and Information Technology Applications", "journal": "Proceedings of the 2015 3rd International Conference on Machinery, Materials and Information Technology Applications", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2249614020", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["14542608", "206748223", "2269279", "3135141", "9442803", "18846096", "9765151", "1344879", "89141", "581041", "7602622"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:74308783"}

It restricts the application of manifold learning methods in many practical problems such as target detection and classification. Previously, some methods have been proposed to provide linear or nonlinear mappings for manifold learning methods. However, a disadvantage of all these methods is that the learned projective functions are combinations of all the original features, thus it is often difficult to interpret the results. Moreover, the dense projection matrices of these approaches lead to a high cost of computation and storage. In this paper, a sparse polynomial mapping approach is proposed for manifold learning. We first get the low-dimensional representations of the high-dimensional input data by using a manifold learning method, and then a \ufffd\ufffd 1-based simplified polynomial regression is used to get a sparse polynomial mapping between the high-dimensional data and their low-dimensional representations.

Most existing algorithms for solving this problem are developed in the fully-supervised setting, requiring access to a large number of labeled training data. However, it is impractical to expect large quantities of labeled data because the high cost of data annotation. Besides, re-ranking is a significant way to improve its performance when considering vehicle re-ID as a retrieval process. Yet limited effort has been devoted to the research of re-ranking in the vehicle re-ID. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning system based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and re-ranking strategy for Vehicle re-ID. Specifically, we adopt the structure of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to obtain more vehicle images and enrich the training set, then a uniform label distribution will be assigned to the unlabeled samples according to the Label Smoothing Regularization for Outliers (LSRO), which regularizes the supervised learning model and improves the performance of re-ID.

In this work, we propose a simple, rapid, inexpensive and non-destructive approach for characterization of different types of vegetable oil blends according to the corresponding color histograms. Regression models were applied on four datasets of binary edible oil blends including; Palm Olein-Rapeseed, Palm Olein-Sunflower, Soybean-Sunflower and Soybean-Rapeseed. In all of the aforementioned data sets, despite the high performances of Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Levenberg-Marquardt Artificial Neural Network (LMANN) regression models in terms of coefficient of determination, Bayesian Regularized Artificial Neural Networks (BRANN) provided better results up to 97% for HSI color histograms in both the training and test sets. In order to reduce the numbers of independent variables for modelling, principle component analysis (PCA) algorithm was used. Finally, the results of image analysis were compared with those obtained by processing of FT-IR spectra of mixtures of edible oils. The results revealed that image analysis of mixtures of edible oils yield comparable results to those obtained by processing of FT-IR spectra for characterization of edible oils.

This oRF outperforms RF, as well as other classifiers, on nearly all data sets but those with discrete factorial features. Learned node models perform distinctively better than random splits. An oRF feature importance score shows to be preferable over standard RF feature importance scores such as Gini or permutation importance.

Fortunately, according to the smoothness assumption that the points close to each other are more likely to share a label, the local topological structure can be shared between the feature manifold and the label manifold. Based on this, we propose a novel method called ML2, i.e., Multi-Label Manifold Learning, to reconstruct and exploit the label manifold.

These methods usually need prior knowledge learned from training dataset, but when the size of the training dataset is small, or the meshes are too complex, the segmentation performance will be greatly effected. This paper introduces an approach to the semantic mesh segmentation and labeling which incorporates knowledge imparted by both segmented, labeled meshes, and unsegmented, unlabeled meshes. A Conditional Random Fields (CRF) based objective function measuring the consistency of labels and faces, labels of neighbouring faces is proposed. To implant the information from the unlabeled meshes, we add an unlabeled conditional entropy into the objective function. With the entropy, the objective function is not convex and hard to optimize, so we modify the Virtual Evidence Boosting (VEB) to solve the semi-supervised problem efficiently. Our approach yields better results than those methods which only use limited labeled meshes, especially when many unlabeled meshes exist. The approach reduces the overall system cost as well as the human labelling cost required during training. We also show that combining knowledge from labeled and unlabeled meshes outperforms using either type of meshes alone. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03217.x", "venue": "Comput.

The different intrinsic representations (features) focus on different geometric properties to describe the same 3D shape, which makes the representations are related. Therefore, it is possible and necessary to learn multiple metrics for different representations jointly. We propose an effective multi-view metric learning algorithm by extending the Marginal Fisher Analysis (MFA) into the multi-view domain, and exploring Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criteria (HSCI) as a diversity term to jointly learning the new metrics. The different classes can be separated by MFA in our method. Meanwhile, HSCI is exploited to make the multiple representations to be consensus.

One of the key detector technologies used for measuring the energy of particles are calorimeters. Particles will lose their energy in a cascade (called a shower) of electromagnetic and hadronic interactions with a dense absorbing material. The number of the particles produced in this showering process is subsequently measured across the sampling layers of the calorimeter. The deposition of energy in the calorimeter due to a developing shower is a stochastic process that can not be described from first principles and rather relies on a precise simulation of the detector response. It requires the modeling of particles interactions with matter at the microscopic level as implemented using the Geant4 toolkit [3]. This simulation process is inherently slow and thus presents a bottleneck in the ATLAS simulation pipeline [4]. The current work addresses this limitation. To meet the growing analysis demands, ATLAS already relies strongly on fast calorimeter simulation techniques based on thousands of individual parametrizations of the calorimeter response [5]. The algorithms currently employed for physics analyses by the ATLAS collaboration achieve a significant speedup over the full simulation of the detector response at the cost of accuracy. Current developments [6] [7] aim at improving the modeling of taus, jet-substructure-based boosted objects or wrongly identified objects in the calorimeter and will benefit from an improved detector description following data taking and a more detailed forward calorimeter geometry. Deep Learning techniques have been improving state of the art results in various science areas such as: astrophysics [8], cosmology [9] and medical imaging [10]. These techniques are able to describe complex data structures and scale well with highdimensionality problems. Generative models are powerful deep learning algorithms to map complex distributions into a lower dimensional space, to generate samples of higher dimensionality and to approximate the underlying probability densities. Among the most promising approaches are Variational Auto-Encoders [11] [12] and Generative Adversarial Networks [13]. In this context, the talk presents the first application of such models to the fast simulation of the calorimeter response in the ATLAS detector.

Methods We used a dataset that include the records of 550 breast cancer patients. Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Least-square SVM (LSSVM) and Adabag, Logistic Regression (LR) and Linear Discriminant Analysis were used for the prediction of breast cancer survival and metastasis.

Results Out of 550 patients, 83.4% were alive and 85% did not experience metastasis. In prediction of survival, the average specificity of all techniques was \u226594% and the SVM and LDA have greater sensitivity (73%) in comparison to other techniques. The greater total accuracy (93%) belonged to the SVM and LDA.

The accuracy of its prediction has great influence on the formulation of power generation plan, power grid dispatching, power grid operation and power supply reliability of power system. Therefore, it is of great significance to construct a suitable model to realize the accurate prediction of the daily peak load. A novel daily peak load forecasting model, CEEMDAN-MGWO-SVM (Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise and Support Vector Machine Optimized by Modified Grey Wolf Optimization Algorithm), is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the model uses the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) algorithm to decompose the daily peak load sequence into multiple sub sequences. Then, the model of modified grey wolf optimization and support vector machine (MGWO-SVM) is adopted to forecast the sub sequences. Finally, the forecasting sequence is reconstructed and the forecasting result is obtained. Using CEEMDAN can realize noise reduction for non-stationary daily peak load sequence, which makes the daily peak load sequence more regular. The model adopts the grey wolf optimization algorithm improved by introducing the population dynamic evolution operator and the nonlinear convergence factor to enhance the global search ability and avoid falling into the local optimum, which can better optimize the parameters of the SVM algorithm for improving the forecasting accuracy of daily peak load. In this paper, three cases are used to test the forecasting accuracy of the CEEMDAN-MGWO-SVM model.

However, the theoretical motivations for adding task similarity knowledge are often missing or incomplete. In this paper, we give a different perspective from a theoretical point of view to understand this practice. We first provide an upper bound on the generalization error of multitask learning, showing the benefit of explicit and implicit task similarity knowledge.

Especially, the expectation of robots used in disasters is increasing to prevent the second disaster. Especially, it is very important to extract the environmental information related for remote control and monitoring of mobile robots. Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is an important methodology to deal with environmental information. Various types of methods for SLAM have been proposed such as Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) SLAM, Graph SLAM, visual SLAM, and cooperative SLAM. In general, there are two main approaches of grid mapping and topological mapping in the study on SLAM. In this talk, we focus on topological mapping methods to extract environmental features from a 3D point cloud. Various types of unsupervised learning methods based on topological mapping have been proposed to deal with environmental features in unknown environments. One of them is Growing Neural Gas (GNG) that can dynamically change the topological structure composed of nodes and edges. The advantage of GNG is in the incremental learning capability of nodes and edges according to target data distribution. We have proposed several different topological mapping methods based on GNG to extract the environmental features from a 3D point cloud until now. In this talk, we explain the research background of SLAM, the learning algorithm of GNG, and experimental results of GNG for SLAM in various environments. Next, we explain multi-layer GNG to extract hierarchical features in environmental maps as a multi-scale approach, and batch learning algorithm for GNG (GL-GNG) to improve the convergence property. Furthermore, we explain the modified method of GNG-utility (GNG-U), that we called GNG-U2. GNG-U2 can improve the real-time adaptability of extracting topological structure in non-stationary data distribution. Next, show experimental results of SLAM based on GNG-U2 in dynamic environments.

Machine learning algorithm based wind speed forecasting models are getting increased attention in the literature owing to its superior ability to learn by effectively capturing the changing patterns from the data. Most of the reported wind forecasting models built on machine learning algorithms are location specific and tested against data adjacent to the training data. In this work, we develop the machine learning based wind speed forecasting models and analyse their performance when applied to data from different cross- locations up to a year ahead. Two distinct machine learning models based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms have been developed and tested separately for a relatively large geographical area. The results of analysis of 1-hour forecasts obtained at various cross-locations and points of time up to a year ahead show 80% of predictions within a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.5 m/s, 95% within 2.5 m/s and 98% within an RMSEof 3.5 m/s. The 75% of 2-hour predictions are within RMSE of 1.5 m/s, 16-hour predictions within RMSE of 2.5 m / s and 48-hour predictions within RMSE of 3.5 m/s. When applied to thesame location of training data, the models generate reliable forecasts for periods up to 22 hours, with the added advantage that the models perform consistently throughout the year ahead horizon, independent of the lead time from the training data.

Nevertheless, fine-tuning deep models in a new domain still requires a significant amount of labeled data despite expensive labeling efforts. A valid question is how to leverage the source knowledge plus unlabeled or only sparsely labeled target data for learning a new model in target domain. The core problem is to bring the source and target distributions closer in the feature space. In the paper, we facilitate this issue in an adversarial learning framework, in which a domain discriminator is devised to handle domain shift. Particularly, we explore the learning in the context of hashing problem, which has been studied extensively due to its great efficiency in gigantic data. Specifically, a novel Deep Domain Adaptation Hashing with Adversarial learning (DeDAHA) architecture is presented, which mainly consists of three components: a deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for learning basic image/frame representation followed by an adversary stream on one hand to optimize the domain discriminator, and on the other, to interact with each domain-specific hashing stream for encoding image representation to hash codes.

Eleven indicators including albedo, land surface temperature (LST), and vegetation indices (VIs) derived from Landsat 8 data were first upscaled to 1 km resolution. Machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Regression (SVR), Cubist, and Random Forest (RF) were used to model the relationship between the Landsat indicators and MODIS 8-day 1 km ET. The models were then used to predict 30 m ET based on Landsat 8 indicators. A total of thirty-two pairs of Landsat 8 images/MODIS ET data were evaluated at four study sites including two in United States and two in South Korea. Among the three models, RF produced the lowest error, with relative Root Mean Square Error (rRMSE) less than 20%. Vegetation greenness related indicators such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and vegetation moisture related indicators such as Normalized Difference Infrared Index\u2014Landsat 8 OLI band 7 (NDIIb7) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) were the five most important features used in RF model. Temperature-based indicators were less important than vegetation greenness and moisture-related indicators because LST could have considerable variation during each 8-day period. The predicted Landsat downscaled ET had good overall agreement with MODIS ET (average rRMSE = 22%) and showed a similar temporal trend as MODIS ET. Compared to the MODIS ET product, the downscaled product demonstrated more spatial details, and had better agreement with in situ ET observations (R2 = 0.56). However, we found that the accuracy of MODIS ET was the main control factor of the accuracy of the downscaled product. Improved coarse-resolution ET estimation would result in better finer-resolution estimation. This study proved the potential of using machine learning approaches for ET downscaling considering their effectiveness and ease of implementation.

The challenging issue is how to monitor and detect these changes in order to preserve the model performance during complex drifts. By complex drift, we mean a drift that presents many characteristics in the sometime. The most challenging complex drifts are gradual continuous drifts, where changes are only noticed during a long time period. Moreover, these gradual drifts may also be local, in the sense that they may affect a little amount of data, and thus make the drift detection more complicated. For this purpose, a new drift detection mechanism, EDIST2, is proposed in order to deal with these complex drifts. EDIST2 monitors the learner performance through a self-adaptive window that is autonomously adjusted through a statistical hypothesis test.

Their manual classification is very time-consuming and not very reliable, since it depends on the subjectivity and on the experience of the specialist. This motivates the growing demand for computer-aided solutions able to perform staining pattern classification in a fully automated way. In this work we compare two classification techniques, based respectively on Support Vector Machines and Subclass Discriminant Analysis. A set of textural features characterizing the available samples are first extracted. Then, a feature selection scheme is applied in order to produce different datasets, containing a limited number of image attributes that are best suited to the classification purpose.

Because the subject matter is richer, the range of vocabulary and grammatical structures is larger meaning NLU tools are more likely to encounter out-of-vocabulary words or extra-grammatical utterances. This is especially true in medical advising and tutoring where users may not know the correct vocabulary and use common sense terms or descriptions instead. Techniques designed to improve robustness (e.g., skipping unknown words, relaxing grammatical constraints, mapping unknown words to known words) are effective at increasing the number of utterances for which an NLU sub-system can produce a semantic interpretation. However, such techniques introduce additional ambiguity and can lead to a loss of fidelity (i.e., a mismatch between the semantic interpretation and what the language producer meant). To control this trade-off, we propose semantic interpretation confidence scores akin to speech recognition confidence scores and describe our initial attempt to compute such a score in a modularized NLU sub-system.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": "W04-2801", "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "International Workshop On Scalable Natural Language Understanding ScaNaLU", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1497493564", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14764558", "16830932", "5959092", "17441580", "6290228", "15297879", "7793911", "2146137", "5968214", "1016382"], "inbound_citations": ["5394113", "17737750", "6297884", "52902146", "13296496"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14753231"}

Many existing signature recognition techniques for intrusion detection cannot handle huge amounts of complex data from computer network systems to detect intrusions in an automatic, scalable and incremental manner. ::: This research proposes a scalable data mining algorithm, Clustering and Classification Algorithm - Supervised (CCA-S), for automatically and incrementally learning intrusion signatures that are then used to detect intrusions.

In training, based on distance and target class of the data points of normal and intrusive activities, these algorithms perform supervised clustering to group training data points into clusters. The produced clusters are used in classification to predict the target class of testing data points. Several post-processing techniques, including redistribution and a special hierarchical clustering method, are used to improve the robustness and prediction accuracy. The two algorithms are tested on two large data sets for intrusion detection, respectively. The prediction accuracy, scalability and robustness of the algorithms are analyzed and compared with those of other data mining techniques.

Some recently proposed Generative Adversarial Networks enhance the perceptual quality greatly, but their objective quality is very low, which means their generated texture details are not faithful to the real image. In this paper, we adopt a multi-scale HR construction process to generate HR images gradually to achieve large upscaling factors. For each level, the generation of HR difference features from LR features is taken as a feature translation process, and deep image feature translation network (DFTN) is designed. To recover finer texture details, we combine three loss functions: content loss, a novel fine-grained texture loss and adversarial loss in our model optimization. We desire that the content loss ensures the LR results faithful to the original image, and the other two losses push our model to capture the manifold of natural images. Experiments confirm that our model can achieve the state-of-the-art results in different evaluating metrics, including both objective and perceptual quality evaluations.

In the second stage (testing data), the decision is validated by the NST (target value). Experiments are performed on previously collected data. Fortyfour preterm with IUGR and without IUGR pregnancies before 34 weeks gestation are considered.The nonparametric Bayes-risk decision rule, k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), is used for comparison. It is observed that the SVM system is proven to be useful in predicting the expected risk in IUGR cases in this small population study. The PI and RI values of UA, MCA and DV are also effective in distinguishing IUGR at risk.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/mca15030472", "venue": null, "journal": "Mathematical & Computational Applications", "mag_id": "2337952805", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:124113823"}

With VAE and GAN as the basic components, we propose Cycle Conditional-VAE-GAN (Cycle CVAE-GAN) to tackle the problem within four steps. First, the source image with target-view condition and the target image are both mapped to the shared latent variable space by two encoders. Second, we sample a variable from the shared variable space as the input of a designed decoder for the low-resolution target image generation. Third, we repeat the previous two steps. It is worth mentioning that the inputs of those two encoders are the generated low-resolution target image with source-view condition and the source image. Then the reconstructed source image can contribute to the cycle consistency loss. Finally, a GAN framework with a dual-input U-Net generator and a patch discriminator are proposed to generate high-resolution and realistic target images.

Step 1 transforms inertial sensor data into a head orientation-independent and stable normalized coordinate system. Step 2 extracts critical features (statistical, physical, GIST). Step 3 classifies activities (Naive Bayes classifier), distinguishes between environments (Support Vector Machine), and finally combines both results (Hidden Markov Model) for further improvement. SAS has been implemented on a sensor-equipped eyeglasses prototype and achieved high accuracy (81.5%) when distinguishing between 20 real-world activities.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IROS.2013.6697178", "venue": "2013 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems", "journal": "2013 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2094058108", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1694951", "2791599", "7834819", "18726816", "16940389", "12480670", "3348287", "11664336", "2443126"], "inbound_citations": ["52927457", "4950824", "199541203", "11193846", "202745618", "9409797", "24994146", "141398", "117184294", "59411644", "49300179", "202093298", "174818535", "210861139", "16678985", "32432531", "18705575", "18975013"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14420695"}

This thesis presents a set of bioinformatics resources including a software platform for data visualization and data analysis that address the key issues in incorporating the metabolomics data for functional genomics studies. Since a single metabolomics technique cannot cover the whole metabolome, multiple mass spectrometry based metabolomics platforms are integrated together to get biomarkers across a wide range of metabolite families. The use of different metabolomics platforms increases the coverage of the metabolome, but multiple platforms present significant challenges on integrating data across the platforms. Different strategies for integrating the metabolomics abundance data from multiple platforms are compared to find the ideal method for biomarker discovery. One of the biggest challenges in metabolomics is to understand the role of structrully unknown metabolites which constitute a major part of the detected metabolites in any large scale metabolomics study. A new method of putatively identifying unknown metabolites by partial correlation networks is proposed. Gaussian graphical models which are based on first order partial correlation networks built across a large range of mutant lines are sparse and mimic the actual biochemical topology. These correlation networks are preserved across many different mutations and can provide a cost effective alternative for getting more insight into the underlying biochemical network and form hypotheses about the novel pathways. A comprehensive study of 70 single gene knock mutants vs. wild type samples is performed using Random Forest machine learning algorithm and a biomarker database for the key metabolites including the putative identifications of unknown metabolites is built. A proof-of-concept analysis on the oxoprolinase (OXP1) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT1 and GGT2) single gene knock-out mutants in the glutathione degradation (GSH) pathway of the Arabidopsis confirms the known biology that OXP1 is responsible for conversion of 5-oxoproline (5-OP) to glutamic acid. In addition, GGT1/GGT2 analysis supports the hypothesis that the GGT genes may not be major contributors for the 5-OP production. Also, the GGT2 mutation does not appear to alter the biochemical profile of the cells in comparison to the wild type samples, suggesting that it may be a redundant gene.

However, such estimates at regional and local scales are still highly uncertain. Airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) and Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) can characterize the structural and functional diversity of forests with high accuracy at a sub-meter resolution, and potentially improve the AGB estimations. In this study, we compared the ability of different data sources (airborne LiDAR and HSI, and their combination) and regression methods (linear model - LM, linear model with ridge regularization - LMR, Support Vector Regression - SVR, Random Forest - RF, Stochastic Gradient Boosting - SGB, and Cubist - CB) to improve AGB predictions in the Brazilian Amazon. We used georeferenced inventory data from 132 sample plots to obtain a reference field AGB and calculated 333 metrics (45 from LiDAR and 288 from HSI) that could be used as predictors for statistical AGB models. We submitted the metrics to a correlation filtering followed by a feature selection procedure (recursive feature elimination) to optimize the performance of the models and to reduce their complexity. Results showed that both LiDAR and HSI data used alone provided relatively high accurate models if adequate metrics and algorithms are chosen (RMSE = 67.6 Mg.ha\u22121, RMSE% = 36%, R2 = 0.58, for the best LiDAR model; RMSE = 68.1 Mg.ha\u22121, RMSE% = 36%, R2 = 0.58, for the best HSI model). However, HSI-only models required more metrics (5\u201312) than LiDAR-only models (2\u20135). Models combining metrics from both datasets resulted in more accurate AGB estimates, regardless of the regression method (RMSE = 57.7 Mg.ha\u22121, RMSE% = 31%, R2 = 0.70, for the best model). The most important LiDAR metrics for estimating AGB were related to the upper canopy cover and tree height percentiles, while the most important HSI metrics were associated with the near infrared and shortwave infrared spectral regions, particularly the leaf/canopy water and lignin-cellulose absorption bands. Finally, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the remote sensing data source (LiDAR, HSI, or their combination) had a greater effect size than the regression algorithms. Thus, no single algorithm outperformed the others, although the LM method was less suitable when applied to the HSI and hybrid datasets.

Different from the generative network in basic cGAN, we propose an encoder and decoder architecture so that it can generate better results. To generate realistic clear images, we further modify the basic cGAN formulation by introducing the VGG features and an L1-regularized gradient prior.

Currently, no form of data augmentation has been proposed that can be applied directly to embedding inputs to improve downstream model performance.

This article explores and enhances benefits of General Line Coordinates. It shows the ways to increase expressiveness of General Line Coordinates including decreasing occlusion and simplifying visual pattern while preserving all n-D data in two dimensions by adjusting General Line Coordinates for given n-D datasets. The adjustments include relocating, rescaling, and other transformations of General Line Coordinates. One of the major sources of benefits of General Line Coordinates relative to Parallel Coordinates is twice less number of point and lines in visual representation of each n-D points. This article demonstrates the benefits of different General Line Coordinates for real data visual analysis such as health monitoring and benchmark Iris data classification compared with results from Parallel Coordinates, Radvis, and Support Vector Machine.

In this study, a novel modeling framework integrating bivariate empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) and support vector regression (SVR), extended from the well-established empirical mode decomposition (EMD) based time series modeling framework in the energy demand forecasting literature, is proposed for interval forecasting of electricity demand. The novelty of this study arises from the employment of BEMD, a new extension of classical empirical model decomposition (EMD) destined to handle bivariate time series treated as complex-valued time series, as decomposition method instead of classical EMD only capable of decomposing one-dimensional single-valued time series. This proposed modeling framework is endowed with BEMD to decompose simultaneously both the lower and upper bounds time series, constructed in forms of complex-valued time series, of electricity demand on a monthly per hour basis, resulting in capturing the potential interrelationship between lower and upper bounds. The proposed modeling framework is justified with monthly interval-valued electricity demand data per hour in Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, indicating it as a promising method for interval-valued electricity demand forecasting.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": "1406.3792", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ijepes.2014.06.010", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1978429571", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["96636464", "56238142", "23146393", "108822478", "154558438", "110899196", "97873199", "109980816", "153352567", "95456699", "34005461", "154539080", "123100932", "154912178", "380792", "153781981", "95118969", "108750422", "109222421", "26359787", "128824132", "59431363", "8608609", "15070248", "120095756", "1262186", "207152935", "153554465", "961425"], "inbound_citations": ["55784509", "64966283", "56352477", "52885256", "46752039", "55852556", "55791780", "201872867", "27889877", "67772544", "158733445", "2266821", "6601059", "13767000", "211211246"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18336879"}

A typical system consists of the blood pumps, oxygenators, and cannulas. During extracorporeal blood remains in contact with a foreign surface. This leads to the activation of inflammatory mediators, which can give rise to oxidative stress in cells. The aim of this study was to estimate how anticoagulant drugs and NIR radiation influence the animal plasma during extracorporeal circulation. The research material was prepared from blood plasma of pigs connected to the ECMO and ECLA (respiratory support) apparatus. Animals were assigned to three experimental groups: animals in group 1 (n=8) received no drug pretreatment and served as controls; animals in group 2 (n=6) were treated with thrombotic drugs (clopidogrel and aspirin) at least 24 hours before extracorporeal circulation; in animals belonging to group 3 (n=7) the blood was exposed to near infrared (NIR) radiation during extracorporeal circulation. This procedure lasted for 6 hours. Blood samples were collected from all of the animals during circulation at the same stages of the procedure, the plasma was then separated and immediately frozen to -20\u00b0C. After thawing, ATR-FTIR spectra of the plasma solution were recorded on a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer equipped with the ATR diamond crystal. In this work, changes in plasma during extracorporeal circulation have been studied by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. This technique is useful in the analysis of spectral parameters of bands associated with the CH3 and CH2 stretching vibrations in 2996\u20132800 cm region. The intensities of proteins bands and those of amino acids and lactate were studied. The spectral data were subjected to advanced statistical analysis using classifier ensemble methods.

The results show that extracorporeal circulation causes changes in the parameters of the analyzed bands. They suggest also that anticoagulant drugs can Proceedings IWBBIO 2014. Granada 7-9 April, 2014 1416 increase oxidative stress. In contrast, NIR radiation is likely to cause the release of NO (nitric oxide), which can be a rapid intervention at the beginning of oxidative stress. NO plays an important role in inhibiting platelet aggregation. Advanced statistical analysis suggests that NIR effects on the plasma are significant and can strongly change the properties of plasma. Samples, which were influenced by anticoagulant drugs, are in about 40% misclassified as control samples. This indicates that the effects of anticoagulant drugs vary and often may have small or no influence on the properties of examined plasma.

Results obtained from the modeling efforts indicated a good capability of the neural network model to reconstruct the cooling effectiveness distribution on the external surface of the porous plates. Integrated with this low cost machine learning model, the GA approach successfully identified several optimized structures which fit well with the thermal loads induced by non-uniform incoming gas temperate.

Person re-identification (ReID) in color and thermal images require matching of the object color and its temperature. While thermal cameras increase the performance of ReID systems during the night-time, identification of corresponding features in the visible and the long-wave infrared range is challenging. The biggest challenge arises from the multimodal relationship between an object\u2019s color and its temperature. Modern ReID methods provide state-of-the-art results in person matching in the visible range. Hence, it is possible to perform multimodal matching by translation of a thermal probe image to the color domain. After that, the synthetic color probe image is matched with images from the real color gallery set. This paper is focused on the development of the ThermalReID multispectral person ReID framework. The framework performs matching in two steps. Firstly, it colorizes the input thermal probe image using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Secondly, it matches images in the color domain using color histograms and MSCR features. We evaluate the ThermalReID framework using RegDB and ThermalWorld datasets. The results of the evaluation are twofold. Firstly, the developed GAN performs realistic colorization of thermal images. Secondly, the ThermalReID framework provides matching of persons in color and thermal images that compete with and surpass the state-of-the-art. The developed ThermalReID framework can be used in video surveillance systems for effective person ReID during the nighttime.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-2-W12-111-2019", "venue": null, "journal": "ISPRS - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2944641461", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["25621509", "52561529", "18135423", "4009486", "6485959", "7973738", "6469259", "4556464", "59222436", "4269137", "3458516", "41908779", "40027675", "8246916", "5584770", "3719281", "4546391", "51876005", "4418812", "1068496", "9615667", "6258614", "19231802", "51607387", "9088600", "14991802"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:165127195"}

This representation is called LBP flow, which performs well as a static representation of gait movement. Dynamics within and among gait stances becomes the key consideration for multiframe detection and tracking, which is quite different from existing approaches. To simulate the natural way of knowledge acquisition, an individual hidden Markov model (HMM) representing the gait dynamics of a single subject incrementally evolves from a population model that reflects the average motion process of human gait.

However, it can be difficult to match features across significantly different views. Furthermore, calibration information is not always available and planar world hypothesis can be too restrictive. In this paper, a new approach is presented for matching correspondences based on the use of nonlinear manifold learning and system dynamics identification.

The basic characteristics of the material, which determine its belonging to a certain class, are established. Training and test samples based on 20 features that characterize each of the four classes of titanium alloy powders for the implementation of machine learning procedures were built. The developed method for identification of the class of material, based on the use of the second-order Kolmogorov-Gabor polynomial and the Random Forest algorithm, is described. An experimental comparison of the developed method work results with existing methods: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vectors Machines based on the accuracy of their work in the training and application modes was made. The visualization of the results of all the investigated methods was given. The developed supervised learning method allows constructing models for processing a large number of each input vector characteristics. In this case, the Random Forest algorithm provides satisfactory generalization properties while retaining the advantages of an additional increase of the accuracy based on the Kolmogorov-Gabor polynomial. The main advantages of the developed method, in particular, regarding the additional increase of the accuracy of the classification task solution, are experimentally determined. The developed method allows increasing the modeling accuracy by 34.38, 33.34 and 3.13 % compared with the methods: Support Vectors Machine, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest respectively.

Automatic medical diagnosis classification tools reduce financial burden on health care systems. In medical diagnosis, patterns consist of observable symptoms and the results of diagnostic tests, which have various associated costs and risks. In this paper, we have experimented and suggested an automated pattern classification method for classifying four diseases into two classes. In the literature on machine learning or data mining, regression and classification problems are typically viewed as two distinct problems differentiated by continuous or categorical dependent variables. There are endeavors to use regression methods to solve classification problems and vice versa. To regard a classification problem as a regression one, we propose a method based on the Support Vector Regression (SVR) classification model as one of the powerful methods in intelligent field management. We apply the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II), a kind of multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, to find mapping points (MPs) for rounding a real-value to an integer one. Also, we employ the NSGA-II to find out and tune the SVR kernel parameters optimally so as to enhance the performance of our model and achieve better results.

In order to extend its application to problems in which data sets arrive constantly and in which batch processing of the data sets is infeasible or expensive, an accurate online SVR (AOSVR) technique was proposed. The AOSVR technique efficiently updates a trained SVR function whenever a sample is added to or removed from the training set without retraining the entire training data. However, the AOSVR technique assumes that the new samples and the training samples are of the same characteristics; hence, the same value of SVR parameters is used for training and prediction. This assumption is not applicable to data samples that are inherently noisy and nonstationary, such as sensor data. As a result, we propose AOSVR with varying parameters that uses varying SVR parameters rather than fixed SVR parameters and hence accounts for the variability that may exist in the samples. To accomplish this objective, we also propose a generalized weight function to automatically update the weights of SVR parameters in online monitoring applications. The proposed function allows for lower and upper bounds for SVR parameters. We tested our proposed approach and compared results with the conventional AOSVR approach using two benchmark time-series data and sensor data from a nuclear power plant.

Then, the feature brings in the idea of a Local Binary Pattern (LBP), assembling several neighboring binary Haar features to improve discriminating power and reduce the effect of illumination. Next, a pedestrian classification method based on an improved deep belief network (DBN) classification algorithm is proposed. An improved method of input is constructed using a Restricted Bolzmann Machine (RBM) with T distribution function visible layer nodes, which can convert information on pedestrian features to a Bernoulli distribution, and the Bernoulli distribution can then be used for recognition. In addition, a middle layer of the RBM structure is created, which achieves data transfer between the hidden layer structure and keeps the key information. Finally, the cost-sensitive Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used for the output of the classifier, which could address the class-imbalance problem.

The search performance mainly depends on the estimation of the distance or similarity between the queried item and all the curated items in the database. The simple Euclidean (EU) distance cannot capture the data characteristics, we therefore introduce distance metric learning (DML) to improve the distance estimation. Traditional DML methods only utilize the side information (e.g., similar/dissimilar constraints or relevance/irrelevance judgements) in the target domain, and may fail when the side information is scarce. Transfer metric learning (TML) can be adopted to leverage the side information from related domains.

Usually these parameters are randomly chosen. However, SVM is highly needed to determine the optimal parameters values to obtain expected learning performance. In this chapter, an optimization method based on optimal foraging theory is proposed to adjust the two main parameters of gaussian kernel function of SVM to increase the classification accuracy. Six well-known benchmark datasets taken from UCI machine learning data repository were employed for evaluating the proposed (OFA-SVM). In addition, the performance of the proposed optimal foraging algorithm for SVM\u2019s parameters optimization (OFA-SVM) is compared with five other well-known and recently meta-heuristic optimization algorithms. These algorithms are Bat Algorithm (BA), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Chicken Swarm Optimization (CSO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

An efficient, effective and very reliable braking system is evidently very critical for trains running at a speed around 300 km/h. Failure of a highly reliable braking system is a rare event and, consequently, informative recorded data on fault conditions are scarce. This renders the fault detection problem a classification problem with highly unbalanced data. In this paper, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) framework, including feature selection, feature vector selection, model construction and decision boundary optimization, is proposed for tackling this problem. Feature vector selection can largely reduce the data size and, thus, the computational burden. The constructed model is a modified version of the least square SVM, in which a higher cost is assigned to the error of classification of faulty conditions than the error of classification of normal conditions. The proposed framework is successfully validated on a number of public unbalanced datasets. Then, it is applied for the fault detection of braking systems in HST: in comparison with several SVM approaches for unbalanced datasets, the proposed framework gives better results.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ymssp.2016.10.034", "venue": null, "journal": "Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2555835967", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["6416766", "207155015", "18831035", "12720324", "41380054", "108714615", "26571361", "21431769", "119809106", "9885187", "9836378", "2380770", "11006760", "17081372", "2907777", "123592590", "34295649", "7634285"], "inbound_citations": ["33090483", "56478556", "52149432", "5029459", "4559709", "19119582", "52892828", "52149163", "5033816", "203605760", "115452764", "20574839", "69776764", "89612810", "59601836", "202700878", "208206606", "44123103", "52986310"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125890551"}

In the image representation method, the local-based representation is the best selection for object-based image retrieval. As a kernel-based classification method, Support Vector Machine (SVM) has shown impressive performance on image classification. But SVM cannot work on the local-based representation unless there is an appropriate kernel. To address this problem, some representative kernels are proposed in literatures. However, these kernels cannot work effectively in object-based image retrieval due to ignoring the spatial context and the combination of local features. In this article, we present Adjacent Matrix (AM) and the Local Combined Features (LCF) to incorporate the spatial context and the combination of local features into the kernel. We propose the AM-LCF feature vector to represent image content and the AM-LCF kernel to measure the similarities between AM-LCF feature vectors. According to the detailed analysis, we show that the proposed kernel can overcome the deficiencies of existing kernels. Moreover, we evaluate the proposed kernel through experiments of object-based image retrieval on two public image sets.

Although most static objects subtract cleanly, even a very low false positive detection rate can lead to hundreds of non-supernova candidates which must be vetted by human inspection before triggering additional followup. In comparison to simple threshold cuts, more sophisticated methods such as Boosted Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines provide dramatically better object discrimination. At the Nearby Supernova Factory, we reduced the number of non-supernova candidates by a factor of 10 while increasing our supernova identification efficiency.

In particular, regression and classification models for three different issues are inferred using both methods under different experimental scenarios: two drug-like properties, such as blood-brain-barrier and human intestinal absorption, and enantiomeric excess, as a measurement of purity used for chiral substances. Beyond the contrastive analysis of feature selection and feature learning methods as competitive approaches, the hybridization of these strategies is also evaluated based on previous results obtained in material sciences.

They function as messengers for transferring genetic information from DNA to proteins, as the primary genetic material in many viruses, as catalysts (ribozymes) important for protein synthesis and RNA processing, and as essential and ubiquitous regulators of gene expression in living organisms. Many of these functions depend on precisely orchestrated interactions between RNA molecules and specific proteins in cells. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which proteins recognize and bind RNA is essential for comprehending the functional implications of these interactions, but the recognition \u2018code\u2019 that mediates interactions between proteins and RNA is not yet understood. Success in deciphering this code would dramatically impact the development of new therapeutic strategies for intervening in devastating diseases such as AIDS and cancer. Because of the high cost of experimental determination of protein-RNA interfaces, there is an increasing reliance on statistical machine learning methods for training predictors of RNA-binding residues in proteins. However, because of differences in the choice of datasets, performance measures, and data representations used, it has been difficult to obtain an accurate assessment of the current state of the art in protein-RNA interface prediction.ResultsWe provide a review of published approaches for predicting RNA-binding residues in proteins and a systematic comparison and critical assessment of protein-RNA interface residue predictors trained using these approaches on three carefully curated non-redundant datasets. We directly compare two widely used machine learning algorithms (Na\u00efve Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)) using three different data representations in which features are encoded using either sequence- or structure-based windows. Our results show that (i) Sequence-based classifiers that use a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM)-based representation (PSSMSeq) outperform those that use an amino acid identity based representation (IDSeq) or a smoothed PSSM (SmoPSSMSeq); (ii) Structure-based classifiers that use smoothed PSSM representation (SmoPSSMStr) outperform those that use PSSM (PSSMStr) as well as sequence identity based representation (IDStr). PSSMSeq classifiers, when tested on an independent test set of 44 proteins, achieve performance that is comparable to that of three state-of-the-art structure-based predictors (including those that exploit geometric features) in terms of Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), although the structure-based methods achieve substantially higher Specificity (albeit at the expense of Sensitivity) compared to sequence-based methods. We also find that the expected performance of the classifiers on a residue level can be markedly different from that on a protein level. Our experiments show that the classifiers trained on three different non-redundant protein-RNA interface datasets achieve comparable cross-validation performance. However, we find that the results are significantly affected by differences in the distance threshold used to define interface residues.ConclusionsOur results demonstrate that protein-RNA interface residue predictors that use a PSSM-based encoding of sequence windows outperform classifiers that use other encodings of sequence windows. While structure-based methods that exploit geometric features can yield significant increases in the Specificity of protein-RNA interface residue predictions, such increases are offset by decreases in Sensitivity. These results underscore the importance of comparing alternative methods using rigorous statistical procedures, multiple performance measures, and datasets that are constructed based on several alternative definitions of interface residues and redundancy cutoffs as well as including evaluations on independent test sets into the comparisons.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3490755", "pubmed_id": "22574904", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-13-89", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2156215828", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["36212884", "9329985", "7340481", "13373531", "21517625", "7212609", "40589986", "26991038", "248025", "5960199", "8601764", "19495390", "16541693", "25308848", "34945548", "12606610", "795538", "15608293", "8660138", "6575175", "15065218", "23950803", "2377376", "6695218", "14843439", "28086663", "6673404", "1005534", "21310207", "1035800", "12101624", "32567641", "14514863", "1038517", "24472037", "18221187", "2907282", "257843", "6081008", "1471236", "7515258", "12004552", "2528932", "11051656", "2181319", "16805425", "27750459", "14294957", "7553535", "7971799", "1852786", "22593506", "61816359", "410081", "17145676", "18902361", "25175589", "13267624", "8681107", "140109802", "1536643", "6923178", "8926237", "207159665"], "inbound_citations": ["4870589", "25996800", "1055427", "23001768", "44181403", "1679788", "16608767", "15514581", "215579976", "350874", "215214669", "11313718", "3818271", "11933787", "2109422", "8320048", "215627880", "1611540", "215728246", "215685833", "16419560", "25754262", "1265451", "745964", "13883311", "215180746", "12071379", "11538054", "3820508", "13527970", "15550986", "68152117", "3430060", "25094349", "204942296"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15531335"}

The latter two operations are both performed in an interactive way. The BPT provides a hierarchical representation of the spatial regions of the data and, after an appropriate pruning, it yields a segmentation map which can be improved by the user. SVMs are used to obtain a classification map of the image with which the user can interact to get better results. The interactivity is twofold: it allows the user to get a better segmentation by exploring the BPT structure, and to help the classifier to better discriminate the classes. This is performed by improving the representativity of the training set, adding new pixels from the segmented regions to the training samples.

We assume that processing cores and memories are safe and anomaly is included through a communication medium (i.e., router). The article targets three different attacks, namely, traffic diversion, route looping, and core address spoofing attacks. The attacks are detected by using machine-learning techniques. Comprehensive analysis on machine-learning algorithms suggests that Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) have better attack detection efficiency. It has been observed that both algorithms have accuracy in the range of 94p to 97p. Additional hardware complexity analysis advocates SVM to be implemented on hardware. To test the framework, we implement a condition-based attack insertion module; attacks are performed intra- and intercluster. The proposed real-time anomaly detection framework is fully placed and routed on Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA. Postplace and -route implementation results show that SVM has 12p to 2p area overhead and 3p to 1p power overhead for the quad-core and 16-core implementation, respectively. It is also observed that it takes 25p to 18p of the total execution time to detect an anomaly in transferred packets for quad-core and 16-core, respectively.

However, popular SVM solvers are not sufficiently efficient for applications with a great deal of samples as well as a large number of features. In this paper, thus, we present NESVM, a fast gradient SVM solver that can optimize various SVM models, e.g., classical SVM, linear programming SVM and least square SVM. Compared against SVM-Perf \\cite{SVM_Perf}\\cite{PerfML} (its convergence rate in solving the dual SVM is upper bounded by $\\mathcal O(1/\\sqrt{k})$, wherein $k$ is the number of iterations.) and Pegasos \\cite{Pegasos} (online SVM that converges at rate $\\mathcal O(1/k)$ for the primal SVM), NESVM achieves the optimal convergence rate at $\\mathcal O(1/k^{2})$ and a linear time complexity. In particular, NESVM smoothes the non-differentiable hinge loss and $\\ell_1$-norm in the primal SVM. Then the optimal gradient method without any line search is adopted to solve the optimization. In each iteration round, the current gradient and historical gradients are combined to determine the descent direction, while the Lipschitz constant determines the step size. Only two matrix-vector multiplications are required in each iteration round. Therefore, NESVM is more efficient than existing SVM solvers. In addition, NESVM is available for both linear and nonlinear kernels. We also propose\"homotopy NESVM\"to accelerate NESVM by dynamically decreasing the smooth parameter and using the continuation method.

Firstly, the loads at 24 times a day are grouped into three categories according to the K-means clustering algorithm, which correspond to the valley period, flat period, and peak period of the load, respectively. Secondly, the load point forecasting value is obtained by LSSVM method optimized by SSA algorithm. Furthermore, the kernel density estimation method is employed to fit the forecasting error of SSA-LSSVM in different time periods, and the probability density function of the error distribution is obtained. The final load probability density forecasting result is obtained by combining the point forecasting value and the error fitting result, and then the upper and lower limits of the confidence interval under the given confidence level are solved.

Image captioning involves not just detecting objects from images but understanding the interactions between the objects to be translated into relevant captions. So, expertise in the field of computer vision paired with natural language processing is crucial for this purpose. The sequence to sequence modelling strategy of deep neural networks is the traditional approach to generate a sequential list of words that are combined to represent the image. But these models suffer from the problem of high variance by not being able to generalize well on the training data. The main focus of this paper is to reduce the variance factor that will help in generating better captions. To achieve this, Ensemble Learning techniques have been explored, which have the reputation of solving the high variance problem that occurs in machine learning algorithms. Three different ensemble techniques namely, k-fold ensemble, bootstrap aggregation ensemble and boosting ensemble have been evaluated in our work. For each of these techniques, three output combination approaches have been analyzed. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the Flickr8k dataset which has a collection of 8000 images and 5 different captions for every image. The bleu score performance metric, which is considered to be the standard for evaluating natural language processing (NLP) problems, is used to evaluate the predictions.

An au- tomated system for early detection of DR can save patient's vision and can also help the ophthalmologists in screening of DR.In this thesis, we develop algorithms for retinal image analysis based on image processing and pattern classification.Image processing techniques are used for retinal image enhancement and pattern recognition is used for classi\ufffdcation of DR stages.The proposed system consists of different stages such as preprocessing, compo- nent extraction, candidate region detection, feature extraction and finally the classification. The first phase consists of input retinal image enhancement, noise removal, extraction of main retinal components and candidate lesions detection.We apply Gabor wavelets and Gabor filter banks for lesion detection.The system then extracts features from candidate lesions using four main properties, i.e. shape, color, gray level and statistical.Finally the classifier takes the feature vectors as inputs and grades the input retinal image into different stages of DR.We present a hybrid classifier which combines the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and an extension of multimodel mediod based modeling approach in an ensemble to improve the accuracy of classification.The implemented algorithms are tested and evaluated on publicly available retinal image databases using performance parameters such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and accuracy.The performance improvement of our proposed system is demonstrated by com- paring them with recently proposed and published methods", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2280060011", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:112721550"}

The detection of AD in human body is performed by testing a type of antinuclear antibody, Human Epithelial Type 2 (HEp-2). The indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) imaging technique is used to capture the HEp-2 images to be used by physicians for detection. However, the detection of AD by IIF technique and analysis of them depends heavily on the experience of the physicians and may consume a long time. An accurate and automatic Computer Aided Diagnosis system will help greatly for the classification of the patterns in HEp-2 test. In this project an automatic HEp-2 cell image classification technique is proposed that exploits different feature types such as Rotation Invariant Co-Occurrence Local Binary Patterns (RICLBP), Scale Invariant Feature Transform and Speeded-Up Robust Feature. Additionally, a three layer of feature concatenation technique is proposed to extract spatial information of the images rather than local features. Finally, for the classification model, variety of classifiers are exploited to evaluate the performance of the system.

It is a very complicated problem which often suffers from variations in lighting condition, facial expression, head pose, glasses, background, and so on.

To decrease the influence of complex background on the recognition of the foreground object, another biological inspired mechanism\u2014synapse maintenance, which can dynamically determine which synapse should be removed, weaken or strengthened, is introduced to enhance the image recognition rate. To prevent the quick decay of the learning rate with the increasement of the neuron age, simulating the learning principle of the human brain, a new learning rate is proposed to determine the neuron learning process. Moreover, to exploit the network resource efficiently, neuron regenesis mechanism is designed to regulate the neuron resource dynamically. First, we design two kinds of neuron states to depict the neuron action, then, simulating the work mechanism of the human brain to produce new neurons continuously to learn new knowledge, we design the neuron regenesis mechanism to activate the suppressed old neurons in the developmental network to regenerate and learn new feature, thus to enhance the network usage efficiency. In order to demonstrate the effect of DN on face recognition, we compare and analyze the performances of DN with/without synapse maintenance mechanism, with the neuron regenesis mechanism. Experiment results in semi-constrained dataset and unconstrained dataset illustrate that DN with the synapse maintenance and neuron regenesis mechanism can effectively improve the face recognition rate in complex background.

Using four algorithms to wit Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), Isometric Feature Mapping (ISOMAP) and Laplacian Eigenmaps (Lap.

The resulting learned features are then used to train four different classifiers: k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, decision tree and multilayer perceptron. Finally, the non-parametric statistical hypothesis test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, is used to figure out whether or not manifold learning algorithms perform better than PCA. Computational experiments were conducted using the Outex and Salzburg datasets and the obtained results show that among twelve comparisons that were carried out, PCA presented better results than ISOMAP, LLE and Lap.

Most of the existing methods assume the extent to which the given tasks are related or share a common feature space to be known apriori. In real-world applications however, it is desirable to automatically discover the groups of related tasks that share a feature space. In this paper we aim at searching the exponentially large space of all possible groups of tasks that may share a feature space. The main contribution is a convex formulation that employs a graph-based regularizer and simultaneously discovers few groups of related tasks, having close-by task parameters, as well as the feature space shared within each group. The regularizer encodes an important structure among the groups of tasks leading to an efficient algorithm for solving it: if there is no feature space under which a group of tasks has close-by task parameters, then there does not exist such a feature space for any of its supersets. An efficient active set algorithm that exploits this simplification and performs a clever search in the exponentially large space is presented. The algorithm is guaranteed to solve the proposed formulation (within some precision) in a time polynomial in the number of groups of related tasks discovered.

However, how to discover the intrinsic aging trend is still a challenging problem. We proposed a general distance metric learning scheme for regression problems, which utilizes not only data themselves, but also their corresponding labels to strengthen the credibility of distances. This metric could be learned by solving an optimization problem. Via the learned metric, it is easy to find the intrinsic variation trend of data by a relative small amount of samples without any prior knowledge of the structure or distribution of data. Furthermore, the test data could be projected to this metric by a simple linear transformation and it is easy to be combined with manifold learning algorithms to improve the performance. Experiments are conducted on the public FG-NET database by Gaussian process regression in the learned metric to validate our framework, which shows that its performance is improved over traditional regression methods.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CGIV.2009.91", "venue": "2009 Sixth International Conference on Computer Graphics, Imaging and Visualization", "journal": "2009 Sixth International Conference on Computer Graphics, Imaging and Visualization", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2061086108", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11137851", "8774006", "16902615", "13365148", "33520001", "1240111", "1738915", "8340106", "15044843", "10018418", "20282277", "16378222", "14784575", "195652429", "64543020", "18120522", "47325215", "2643381", "176107", "14115306"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14312939"}

Pearson analysis showed that most external phenotypic traits were highly correlated with these internal phenotypes in muskmelon fruit. In this study, we used the random forest algorithm to predict muskmelon fruit internal phenotypes based on the significantly associated external parameters. Carotenoids, sucrose, and total soluble solid (TSS) were the three most accurately monitored internal phenotypes with prediction R-squared (R2) values of 0.947 (root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 0.019 mg/100 g), 0.918 (RMSE = 3.233 mg/g), and 0.916 (RMSE = 1.089%), respectively.

Hence, the factor of safety (FS) was calculated as the soil shear ratio that is necessary to maintain the critical state equilibrium on a potential sliding surface. Regression tree (RT) and Random Forest (RF) models were compared in their predictive force to regionalise the depth of the failure plane and soil bulk density based on terrain parameters. The depth of the failure plane was assumed at the lower boundary of the stagnic soil layer or soil depth respectively, depending on soils being stagnic or non-stagnic.

In this paper, we first emphasize the importance of learning visual discriminative metric and preventing the partial/selective learning behavior of learner in ZSIR, and then propose the Decoupled Metric Learning (DeML) framework to achieve these individually. Instead of coarsely optimizing an unified metric, we decouple it into multiple attention-specific parts so as to recurrently induce the discrimination and explicitly enhance the generalization. And they are mainly achieved by our object-attention module based on random walk graph propagation and the channel-attention module based on the adversary constraint, respectively. We demonstrate the necessity of addressing the vital problems in ZSIR on the popular benchmarks, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.

Still, it is challenging to accurately evaluate the actual amount of C stored in wetlands. The incorporation of remote sensing data into digital soil models has great potential to assess C stocks in wetland soils. Our objectives were (i) to develop C stock prediction models utilizing remote sensing images and environmental ancillary data, (ii) to identify the prime environmental predictor variables that explain the spatial distribution of soil C, and (iii) to assess the amount of C stored in the top 20-cm soils of a prominent nutrient-enriched wetland. We collected a total of 108 soil cores at two soil depths (0-10 cm and 10-20 cm) in the Water Conservation Area 2A, FL. We developed random forest models to predict soil C stocks using field observation data, environmental ancillary data, and spectral data derived from remote sensing images, including Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (spatial resolution: 10 m), Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (30 m), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (250 m). The random forest models showed high performance to predict C stocks, and variable importance revealed that hydrology was the major environmental factor explaining the spatial distribution of soil C stocks in Water Conservation Area 2A.

High-through- put methods can directly detect the set of interact- ing proteins in yeast, but the results are often incomplete and exhibit high false-positive and false- negative rates. Recently, many different research groups independently suggested using supervised learning methods to integrate direct and indirect biological data sources for the protein interaction prediction task. However, the data sources, ap- proaches, and implementations varied. Further- more, the protein interaction prediction task itself can be subdivided into prediction of (1) physical interaction, (2) co-complex relationship, and (3) path- way co-membership. To investigate systematically the utility of different data sources and the way the data is encoded as features for predicting each of these types of protein interactions, we assembled a large set of biological features and varied their encoding for use in each of the three prediction tasks. Six different classifiers were used to assess the accuracy in predicting interactions, Random Forest (RF), RF similarity-based k-Nearest-Neigh- bor, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regres- sion, and Support Vector Machine. For all classifi- ers, the three prediction tasks had different success rates, and co-complex prediction appears to be an easier task than the other two. Independently of prediction task, however, the RF classifier consis- tently ranked as one of the top two classifiers for all combinations of feature sets. Therefore, we used this classifier to study the importance of different biological datasets. First, we used the splitting func- tion of the RF tree structure, the Gini index, to estimate feature importance.

In this paper, a deep difference representation learning model is proposed for multi-spectral change detection. In this model, two stacked denoising autoencoders are established, one for learning more abstract features from raw spectrums blocks, and the other for learning difference representations from the stacked change feature. The former is used to weaken noise interference and reduce redundancy, while the latter has the ability to highlight changes and suppress unchanged pixels.

Sign Language Recognition (SLR), which aims to translate sign language to people who know few about it in the form of text or speech, can be said to be a great help to deaf-mute and hearing people communicate. In this study, a real-time vision-based static hand gesture recognition system for sign language was developed.

Method Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs) collected by spontaneous report, as well as systematic measures for specific physical and psychiatric symptoms. Suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior were systematically assessed by self- and clinician reports. Suicidal events were also reanalyzed by the Columbia Group and expert raters using the Columbia-Classification Algorithm for Suicidal Assessment used in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration reclassification effort. Results Depressed adolescents reported high rates of physical symptoms at baseline, which improved as depression improved. Sedation, insomnia, vomiting, and upper abdominal pain occurred in at least 2% of those treated with FLX and/or COMB and at twice the rate of placebo. The rate of psychiatric AEs was 11% in FLX, 5.6% in COMB, 4.5% in PBO, and 0.9% in CBT. Suicidal ideation improved overall, with greatest improvement in COMB. Twenty-four suicide-related events occurred during the 12-week period: 5 patients (4.7%) in COMB, 10 (9.2%) in FLX, 5 (4.5%) in CBT, and 3 (2.7%) in placebo. Statistically, only FLX had more suicide-related events than PBO ( p =.0402, odds ratio (OR) = 3.7, 95% CI 1.00-63.7). Only five actual attempts occurred (2 COMB, 2 FLX, 1 CBT, 0 PBO). There were no suicide completions. Conclusions Different methods for eliciting AEs produce different results. In general, as depression improves, physical complaints and suicidal ideation decrease in proportion to treatment benefit. In this study, psychiatric AEs and suicide-related events are more common in FLX-treated patients.

Correlated Data Gathering (CDG) in wireless sensor network used Adaptive and Distributed Routing (ADR) algorithm for correlated data gathering in order to minimize the total energy consumption. Though energy consumption was reduced in the network, energy delay tradeoff occurred while securing data in sensor network was high. Energy-efficient and High-accuracy (EEHA) scheme provided a secured data aggregation technique using an aggregation tree which provided privacy but the energy consumption was high during event detection. Recoverable Concealed Data Aggregation (RCDA) for Data Integrity recovered all sensing data events even when the data were aggregated, by reducing the transmission overhead but with higher energy ratio. To develop an energy efficient Event Detection Classifier in wireless sensor network, a predetermined event weight based on Support Vector Machine (EDC-SVM) is proposed in this paper. The EDC-SVM initially identifies the weight of the events for effective classification using SVM with minimal energy consumption. EDC-SVM uses Doppler Effecting method for recovering all sensing data events with minimal energy. The task of Doppler Effecting method in EDC-SVM is to detect the periodic events of moving objects (i.e.,) sensor nodes to reduce the classification time of sensor events. With the minimal time on classification, the energy delay tradeoff is overcome in EDC-SVM.

To estimate and prevent driver fatigue, various classifiers based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have been developed; however, as EEG signals have inherent non-stationary characteristics, their detection performance is often deteriorated by background noise. To investigate the effects of noise on detection performance, simulated Gaussian noise, spike noise, and electromyogram (EMG) noise were added into a raw EEG signal. Four types of entropies, including sample entropy (SE), fuzzy entropy (FE), approximate entropy (AE), and spectral entropy (PE), were deployed for feature sets. Three base classifiers (K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree (DT)) and two ensemble methods (Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging) and Boosting) were employed and compared. Results showed that: (1) the simulated Gaussian noise and EMG noise had an impact on accuracy, while simulated spike noise did not, which is of great significance for the future application of driver fatigue detection; (2) the influence on noise performance was different based on each classifier, for example, the robust effect of classifier DT was the best and classifier SVM was the weakest; (3) the influence on noise performance was also different with each feature set where the robustness of feature set FE and the combined feature set were the best; and (4) while the Bagging method could not significantly improve performance against noise addition, the Boosting method may significantly improve performance against superimposed Gaussian and EMG noise.

In this paper, we propose a novel deep RRL based on a differentiable Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) that can effectively learn relational information from image and present the state of the environment as first order logic predicates. Additionally, it can take the expert background knowledge and incorporate it into the learning problem using appropriate predicates.

This thesis addresses the challenges of learning with continuous data streams, learning with weak supervision, learning with non-stationary data and learning with multi-view data. We introduce the Growing Conceptual Maps Framework as a solution to these challenges, allowing the incremental online learning of a classification model without the requirement of storing training data explicitly. The framework is based on topological feature maps, \\emph{i.e.} Growing Neural Gas, and therefore allows a straight forward visualization of the trained model. ::: ::: With the rapidly increasing amount of data in many domains, such as news feeds, social media, or sensory networks \\emph{etc.}, nowadays, assistive systems are required to process a theoretically infinite stream of data in order to help us in our daily tasks. While existing approaches coming from data mining mostly do not scale up to such large and complex tasks, new paradigms are required which allow the model to grow task-dependently and adapt to a changing environment, in order to learn in a life-long fashion. ::: ::: In this thesis we thus stepwise extend Growing Neural Gas with appropriate novel online labeling and prediction strategies, as well as novel neuron insertion strategies, according to meet these challenges. We evaluate the introduced approaches on benchmarking, artificial and real stream datasets, showing the benefit of our architecture and proving that the Growing Conceptual Maps Framework renders itself ideal for life-long learning by outperforming similar existing approach, and delivering comparable results to other well established classifiers such as a Support Vector Machine. As an application for our framework, we furthermore develop an online human activity classifier based on two Growing Conceptual Maps that can compete with state-of-the-art (offline) human activity classifiers. ::: ::: As a final contribution, we introduce a straight forward visualization schema for Growing Conceptual Maps that allows the user to track emerging categories and their relation according to the underlying map, and furthermore demonstrate its usability of identifying trends and events in stream data.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "22170953", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59773283"}

The system consists of a Scene View Camera (SVC), which operates at a fixed zoom level, and an Object View Camera (OVC), which continuously adjusts its zoom level to match objects of interest. The SVC is set to survey the whole filed of view. Once a region has been identified by the SVC as a potential object of interest, e.g. a face, the OVC zooms in to locate specific features. In this system, face candidate regions are selected based on skin color and face detection is accomplished using a Support Vector Machine classifier. The locations of the eyes and mouth are detected inside the face region using neural network feature detectors. Pose estimation is performed based on a geometrical model, where the head is modeled as a spherical object that rotates upon the vertical axis. The triangle formed by the mouth and eyes defines a vertical plane that intersects the head sphere. By projecting the eyes-mouth triangle onto a two dimensional viewing plane, equations were obtained that describe the change in its angles as the yaw pose angle increases. These equations are then combined and used for efficient pose estimation. The system achieves real-time performance for live video input. Testing results assessing system performance are presented for both still images and video.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.719633", "venue": "SPIE Defense + Commercial Sensing", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2386492745,2109976745", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Geography", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9204636", "13319498", "5745749", "40120983", "475815", "2006805", "11272177", "14727192", "5420729"], "inbound_citations": ["22076646"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52062976"}
