In greater detail, the proposed architecture properly exploits the spatial-context information for: i) increasing the robustness of the learning procedure of SVMs to the noise present in the training set (mislabeled training samples); ii) regularizing the classification maps. The first property is achieved by introducing a context-sensitive term in the objective function to be minimized for defining the decision hyperplane in the SVM kernel space.

The ideal drug candidate should be stable enough to reach its therapeutic site of action. Despite many recent excellent achievements in the field of computational methods supporting drug metabolism studies, a well-recognized procedure to model and predict metabolic stability quantitatively is still lacking. This study proposes a workflow for developing quantitative metabolic stability-structure relationships, taking a set of 30 arylpiperazine derivatives as an example. The metabolic stability of the compounds was assessed in in vitro incubations in the presence of human liver microsomes and NADPH and subsequently quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to obtain 30 models of the molecules, and Dragon software served as a source of structure-based molecular descriptors. For modeling structure-metabolic stability relationships, Support Vector Machines (SVM), a non-linear machine learning technique, were found to be more effective than a regression technique, based on the validation parameters obtained. Moreover, for the first time, general sites of metabolism for arylpiperazines bearing the 4-aryl-2H-pyrido[1,2-c]pyrimidine-1,3-dione system were defined by analysis of Q-TOF-MS/MS spectra. The results indicated that the application of one of the most advanced chemometric techniques combined with a simple and quick in vitro procedure and LC-MS analysis provides a novel and valuable tool for predicting metabolic half-life values. Given the reduced time and simplicity of analysis, together with the accuracy of the predictions obtained, this is a valid approach for predicting metabolic stability using structural data. The approach presented provides a novel, comprehensive and reliable tool for investigating metabolic stability, factors that affect it, and the proposed structures of metabolites at the same time.

Specifically, tracklets orientation and magnitude are quantized in a two-dimensional histogram which encodes the actual motion patterns in each cuboid.

{"paper_id": "62066129", "title": "The symbol grounding problem", "authors": [{"first": "Stevan", "middle": [], "last": "Harnad", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "There has been much discussion recently about the scope and limits of purely symbolic models of the mind and about the proper role of connectionism in cognitive modeling. This paper describes the \"symbol grounding problem\": How can the semantic interpretation of a formal symbol system be made intrinsic to the system, rather than just parasitic on the meanings in our heads? How can the meanings of the meaningless symbol tokens, manipulated solely on the basis of their (arbitrary) shapes, be grounded in anything but other meaningless symbols? The problem is analogous to trying to learn Chinese from a Chinese/Chinese dictionary alone. A candidate solution is sketched: Symbolic representations must be grounded bottom-up in nonsymbolic representations of two kinds: (1) \"iconic representations\" , which are analogs of the proximal sensory projections of distal objects and events, and (2) \"categorical representations\" , which are learned and innate feature-detectors that pick out the invariant features of object and event categories from their sensory projections. Elementary symbols are the names of these object and event categories, assigned on the basis of their (nonsymbolic) categorical representations. Higher-order (3) \"symbolic representations\" , grounded in these elementary symbols, consist of symbol strings describing category membership relations (e.g., \"An X is a Y that is Z\"). Connectionism is one natural candidate for the mechanism that learns the invariant features underlying categorical representations, thereby connecting names to the proximal projections of the distal objects they stand for. In this way connectionism can be seen as a complementary component in a hybrid nonsymbolic/symbolic model of the mind, rather than a rival to purely symbolic modeling. Such a hybrid model would not have an autonomous symbolic \"module,\" however; the symbolic functions would emerge as an intrinsically \"dedicated\" symbol system as a consequence of the bottom-up grounding of categories' names in their sensory representations. Symbol manipulation would be governed not just by the arbitrary shapes of the symbol tokens, but by the nonarbitrary shapes of the icons and category invariants in which they are grounded.", "year":

Following the general Fault Detection and Diagnosis process, the methodology is based on data driven approach for modeling the currents in the time domain, pre-processing with the Park transform and univariate statistical feature extraction and analysis. In the case of incipient faults, the Park transformed currents are more sensitive. Therefore we use their Cumulated Sum (CUSUM) (CUSUM mean or CUSUM variance) for the fault detection. Within the incipient fault ranges ( \u2264 10 % ) and a threshold set to have zero false alarm rate, intensive simulations show that these features successfully detect the fault(s) with a probability of miss detection around 5%. The classification of the seven fault classes that have been identified (3 single and 4 multiple) is successfully done with Linear Discriminant Analysis and Support Vector Machines (SVM) when data is linearly separable or kernel-based SVM when data is non linearly separable. The simulation results show that the misclassification errors are lower than 3%. For the fault estimation, the slope of the CUSUM decision has been identified as a relevant feature.

Compartmental modelling was used to model the behaviour of tracers flowing through the kidney. The derived model led to the formation of the normalized urine flow rate U/V2. An analysis was carried to test the accuracy of the developed index by comparing the developed model and the clinical evaluation of renograms.

In this paper, a prototype-based classification approach for the analysis of DNA barcode, exploiting a spectral representation of DNA sequences and a memory-based neural network, is proposed. The neural network is a modified version of General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) used as a classification tool. Furthermore, the relationship between the characteristics of different species and their spectral distribution is investigated. Namely, a subset of the whole spectrum of a DNA sequence, composed by very high frequency DNA k-mers, is considered providing a robust system for the classification of barcode sequences.

Accurate and robust computer vision algorithms are necessary to detect these various objects that have random shapes, colors, and sizes. In this paper, we have addressed the problem of automatic object detection in pavement images using a unified framework. To detect an object of arbitrary shape in an efficient way, we first divide the image into small consistent regions called superpixels. These superpixels are fast to calculate and preserve object boundaries. We then compute several texture and intensity features within each superpixel. After that, we train support vector machine (SVM) classifier for every feature separately in one-verses-all paradigm. In testing, we first estimate the probability of each superpixel being the part of some object of interest using these SVM classifiers. Since these superpixels\u2019 probabilistic scores are independently computed, they do not preserve neighborhood consistency. Therefore, to enforce superpixel neighborhood label consistency, we use contextual optimization technique i.e., conditional random field (CRF). The output of CRF is a pixel-wise binary label map for the objects and background.

Methods: The GANs architecture was adopted to synthesis high-resolution OCT images training on a publicly available OCT dataset including urgent referrals (choroidal neovascularization and diabetic macular edema) and non-urgent referrals (normal and drusen). 400 real and synthetic OCT images were evaluated by 2 retinal specialists to assess image quality. We further trained 2 DL models on either real or synthetic datasets and compared the performance of urgent vs nonurgent referrals diagnosis tested on a local (1000 images from the public dataset) and clinical validation dataset (278 images from Shanghai Shibei Hospital). Results: The image quality of real vs synthetic OCT images was similar as assessed by 2 retinal specialists. The accuracy of discrimination as real vs synthetic OCT images was 59.50% for retinal specialist 1 and 53.67% for retinal specialist 2. For the local dataset, the DL model trained on real (DL_Model_R) and synthetic OCT images (DL_Model_S) had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.99, and 0.98 respectively. For the clinical dataset, the AUC was 0.94 for DL_Model_R, 0.90 for DL_Model_S.

To address this issue, we propose a novel generalized end-to-end representation learning architecture, dubbed Convolutional Dictionary Pair Learning Network (CDPL-Net) in this paper, which integrates the learning schemes of the CNN and dictionary pair learning into a unified framework. Generally, the architecture of CDPL-Net includes two convolutional/pooling layers and two dictionary pair learn-ing (DPL) layers in the representation learning module. Besides, it uses two fully-connected layers as the multi-layer perception layer in the nonlinear classification module. In particular, the DPL layer can jointly formulate the discriminative synthesis and analysis representations driven by minimizing the batch based reconstruction error over the flatted feature maps from the convolution/pooling layer.

Several statistical methods have been suggested, but some of them result in high false positive rates because they make very strong parametric assumptions. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: We present support vector quantile regression (SVMQR) using iterative reweighted least squares (IRWLS) procedure based on the Newton method instead of usual quadratic programming algorithms. This procedure makes it possible to derive the generalized approximate cross validation (GACV) method for choosing the parameters which affect the performance of SVMAR. We propose SVMQR based on a novel method for identifying differentially expressed genes with a small number of replicated microarrays. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: We applied SVMQR to both three biological dataset and simulated dataset and showed that it performed more reliably and consistently than FC-based gene selection, Newton's method based on the posterior odds of change, or the nonparametric t-test variant implemented in significance analysis of microarrays (SAM). ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: The SVMQR method was an exploratory method for cDNA microarray experiments to identify genes with different expression levels between two types of samples (e.g., tumor versus normal tissue).

In traffic-sign maintenance and in a visual driver assistance system, road-sign detection and recognition are two of the most important functions. Our system is able to detect and recognize the signs. Road signs provide drivers important information and help them to drive more safely and more easily by guiding and warning them and thus regulating their actions. The RGB images are converted into HSV color space, and segmented using LVQ depending on the hue values of each pixel in the HSV color space. LVQ neural network is used to detect the color from the images and recognize them with high accuracy and speed. The detection and recognition of traffic signs represents an important issue in the field of traffic sign analysis. The paper researches the existing traffic sign detection and recognition methods. Special attention has been given to the methods based on artificial neural networks. Some techniques extracted various features from the images containing traffic signs and used various detectors and classifiers to perform detection and recognition. The following examples of these methods can be mentioned: Histogram of Oriented Gradient (2) or (1) and (6) or Support Vector Machines (SVM) (5). Some authors have also used artificial neural networks (4). This paper, however, uses a method of neural network (NN) which has given successful results.

In image processing, image segmentation is not only the critical and essential component but also it is a very difficult task. The actual operation of the algorithm determines the accuracy and quality of image analysis. Color segmentation is a process of extracting one or more connected regions from the image domain. These connected regions are satisfying the uniformity (homogeneity) criterion which is derived from the spectral components. These components are then defined with respect to some color spaced model such as RGB model. RGB is the most common model. In RGB model, a color point is defined by the color components of the corresponding pixel which are defined in the form of Red (R), Green (G) and Blue (B).

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the capability of an electronic nose E-nose to discriminate various gas samples collected from six different sites from the agglomeration of Meknes city corresponding to municipal landfill, in the city at 2 km of landfill, industrial estate wastewater, traffic road, and sheep breeding. The investigations were carried out with an E-nose system based on an array of six-commercial MQ sensors. Further, a pattern recognition technique known as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminent Analysis (LDA), and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) was implemented to study the discrimination capability of the sensor array. PCA results demonstrate excellent discriminating ability of the dataset with a score of 99.47 %. Additionally, another measurement database containing 12 air atmospheric samples was projected on the previously built PCA model to check the stability of the E-nose. The LDA was applied to the same dataset and showed a good discrimination between the ambient air samples of the six sites. Furthermore, SVMs technique was also used to build a classifier and reached a score of 100 % success rate in the recognition of the analysed samples.

The dependence on the latter parameters is linear, and can be solved for efficiently using for example the Normalized Surface Magnetic Charge model. The location and orientation, on the other hand, have a nonlinear effect on the measurable scattered field, making their determination much more time-consuming and thus hampering the ability to carry out discrimination in real time. In particular, it is difficult to resolve for depth when one has measurements taken at only one instrument elevation. In view of the difficulties posed by direct inversion, we propose using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to infer the location and orientation of buried UXO. SVMs are a method of supervised machine learning: the user can train a computer program by feeding it features of representative examples, and the machine, in turn, can generalize this information by finding underlying patterns and using them to classify or regress unseen instances.

The model leads to a generic algorithm that is able to perform learning in a more efficient and flexible manner. Subsequently, it can be used to evaluate the performance of each distribution in the task of image annotation. The approach is also compared to a discriminative approach (i.e. Support Vector Machine) using the LabelMe dataset for the concepts Buildings, Street, Mountains and Coasts, where promising classification results were reported for some of the concepts.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4156/jcit.vol6.issue11.14", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Convergence Information Technology", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2318363749", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["38474756", "7936763"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61356417"}

More than fifty percent of people are living in cities, in this regard, urbanization has become a key factor for global warming. The urban heat island (UHI) refers to the event of higher atmospheric and surface temperatures occurring in cities than in the surrounding rural areas due to urbanization. The annual average air temperature of urban area with almost one million people can be one to three degree warmer than its surroundings. This phenomena can affect societies by increasing summertime, air pollution, air conditioning costs, heat related illness, greenhouse gas emissions and water quality. ::: Tehran, a capital city of Iran is case study of this research. Additionally, Tehran is one of megacities of the world. A megacity is usually defined as a metropolitan area with a total population in excess of ten million people. Due to rapid urbanization progress that has resulted in significant UHI effect in this area. Furthermore, Tehran houses to almost twenty percent of Iranian people. In this study, new launched Landsat series (Landsat 8) was used for monitoring UHI and retrieving the brightness temperatures and land use/cover types. The Landsat 8 carries two kind of sensors: The Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor has former Landsat bands, with three new bands: a deep blue band for coastal/aerosol studies (band 1), a shortwave infrared band for cirrus detection (band 9), and a Quality Assessment band. The Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) sensor provides two high resolution (near to 30 meters) thermal bands (band 10, 11). These sensors both use corrected signal-to-noise (SNR) radiometric quantized over a 12-bit. Corrected SNR performance cause better determination of land cover type. Moreover, Landsat 8 images incorporate two valuable thermal bands in 10.9 \u00b5m and 12.0 \u00b5m. These two thermal bands improve estimation of UHI by incorporating split-window methods. ::: Recently, quantitative models for urban thermal environment and related factors have been studied, for example, the relation between UHI and land cover structure and established corresponding regression equation. Similar works have been done and models of the relation between the surface temperature and various vegetation Indices have been established. In order to monitor the relationship between UHI and land cover indices, this paper tried to employ a quantitative approach for exploring the relationship land surface temperature and common land cover indices and select suitable indices by incorporating supervised Feature Selection (FS) procedures, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) in two definition, Normalized Difference Bareness Index (NDBaI), Normalized Difference Build-up Index (NDBI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Bare Soil Index (BI), Urban Index (UI), Index-based Built-Up Index (IBI) and Enhanced Built-Up and Bareness Index (EBBI). In this regards, the objectives of this research are to develop a non-linear analysis model for urban thermal environment by employing Support Vector Regression (SVR) method and Multivariate Regression (MR) algorithms. In addition, providing the hazard map for Tehran city is also one of the byproducts of proposed methods for managing and mitigating UHI effects.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/ecrs-1-f004", "venue": "Proceedings of 1st International Electronic Conference on Remote Sensing", "journal": "Proceedings of 1st International Electronic Conference on Remote Sensing", "mag_id": "2327577067", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["133976022", "210908219"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:131298141"}

In this paper, we propose a visualization approach based on constrained manifold learning, whose goal is to learn a visualized image that not only preserves the manifold structure of the HSI but also has natural colors. Manifold learning preserves the image structure by forcing pixels with similar signatures to be displayed with similar colors. A composite kernel is applied in manifold learning to incorporate both the spatial and spectral information of HSI in the embedded space. The colors of the output image are constrained by a corresponding natural-looking RGB image, which can either be generated from the HSI itself (e.g., band selection from the visible wavelength) or be captured by a separate device. Our method can be done at instance-level and feature-level. Instance-level learning directly obtains the RGB coordinates for the pixels in the HSI while feature-level learning learns an explicit mapping function from the high dimensional spectral space to the RGB space.

This paper proposes a novel transfer learning scenario, which distills robust phonetic features from grounding models that are trained to tell whether a pair of image and speech are semantically correlated, without using any textual transcripts. As semantics of speech are largely determined by its lexical content, grounding models learn to preserve phonetic information while disregarding uncorrelated factors, such as speaker and channel.

Once trained, the network was used to generate sCT images of 8 patients coming from a third site. The Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) for each patient were evaluated between real and synthetic CTs. A radiotherapy plan was optimized on the sCT series and re-calculated on CTs to assess the dose distribution in terms of voxel-wise dose difference and Dose Volume Histograms (DVH) analysis. It takes on average of 7.5 s to generate a complete sCT (88 slices) for a patient on our GPU. The average MAE in HU between the sCT and actual patient CT (within the body contour) is 48.5 \u00b1 6 HU with our method. The maximum dose difference to the target is 1.3%.

Kosorok1 1The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 2University of Haifa We develop an approach for feature elimination in support vector machines (and empirical risk minimization), based on recursive elimination of features. We present theoretical properties of this method and show that this is uniformly consistent in finding the correct feature space under certain generalized assumptions.

Here we used the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) framework to simulate the concerted activity of a population of neurons. We adapted the Wasserstein-GAN variant to facilitate the generation of unconstrained neural population activity patterns while still benefiting from parameter sharing in the temporal domain. We demonstrate that our proposed GAN, which we termed Spike-GAN, generates spike trains that match accurately the first- and second-order statistics of datasets of tens of neurons and also approximates well their higher-order statistics. We applied Spike-GAN to a real dataset recorded from salamander retina and showed that it performs as well as state-of-the-art approaches based on the maximum entropy and the dichotomized Gaussian frameworks. Importantly, Spike-GAN does not require to specify a priori the statistics to be matched by the model, and so constitutes a more flexible method than these alternative approaches.Finally, we show how to exploit a trained Spike-GAN to construct 'importance maps' to detect the most relevant statistical structures present in a spike train. Spike-GAN provides a powerful, easy-to-use technique for generating realistic spiking neural activity and for describing the most relevant features of the large-scale neural population recordings studied in modern systems neuroscience.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1803.00338", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2785469625,2950276566,2963419146", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["17904296", "37044800", "12616134", "11700856", "5002792", "88983660", "9776546", "11763153", "5216145", "1033682", "10894094", "17980162", "15444743", "8772557", "6628106", "6096415", "8071712", "5748154", "18594959", "9787822", "8675665", "12845709", "128202158", "14899383", "7100921", "3497178", "2633016", "1099052", "4431753", "1122815", "9570939", "306143", "16150191", "11758569", "4045655", "23481859", "4334294", "10087537", "16677359", "1030246", "3960646"], "inbound_citations": ["202766930", "52180364", "46894166", "76667709", "50784066"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3338083"}

However, their fixed architecture, substantial training cost, and significant model redundancy make it difficult to efficiently update them to accommodate previously unseen data. To solve these problems, we propose an incremental learning framework based on a grow-and-prune neural network synthesis paradigm. When new data arrive, the neural network first grows new connections based on the gradients to increase the network capacity to accommodate new data. Then, the framework iteratively prunes away connections based on the magnitude of weights to enhance network compactness, and hence recover efficiency. Finally, the model rests at a lightweight DNN that is both ready for inference and suitable for future grow-and-prune updates. The proposed framework improves accuracy, shrinks network size, and significantly reduces the additional training cost for incoming data compared to conventional approaches, such as training from scratch and network fine-tuning. For the LeNet-300-100 and LeNet-5 neural network architectures derived for the MNIST dataset, the framework reduces training cost by up to 64% (63%) and 67% (63%) compared to training from scratch (network fine-tuning), respectively. For the ResNet-18 architecture derived for the ImageNet dataset and DeepSpeech2 for the AN4 dataset, the corresponding training cost reductions against training from scratch (network fine-tunning) are 64% (60%) and 67% (62%), respectively.

Pattern recognition methods are then applied to the segmented images in order to detect the position of the myocardial scar. The database of late gadolinium enhancement (LE) cardiac MR images consists of 111 blocks of images acquired from 63 patients at the University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust (UK). At least one scar was present for each patient, and all the scars were manually annotated by an expert. A group of images (around one third of the entire set) was used for training the system which was subsequently tested on all the remaining images. Four different classifiers were trained (Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), Bayesian and feed-forward neural network) and their performance was evaluated by using Free response Receiver Operating Characteristic (FROC) analysis. Feature selection was implemented for analyzing the importance of the various features. The segmentation method proposed allowed the region affected by the scar to be extracted correctly in 96% of the blocks of images. The SVM was shown to be the best classifier for our task, and our system reached an overall sensitivity of 80% with less than 7 false positives per patient.

Patients with early stage lung cancer have the best prognosis with surgical removal of the tumor, but the disease is often asymptomatic until advanced disease develops, and there are no effective blood-based screening methods for early detection of lung cancer in at-risk populations. We have explored the lipid profiles of blood plasma exosomes using ultra high-resolution Fourier transform mass spectrometry (UHR-FTMS) for early detection of the prevalent non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Exosomes are nanovehicles released by various cells and tumor tissues to elicit important biofunctions such as immune modulation and tumor development. Plasma exosomal lipid profiles were acquired from 39 normal and 91 NSCLC subjects (44 early stage and 47 late stage). We have applied two multivariate statistical methods, Random Forest (RF) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to classify the data. For the RF method, the Gini importance of the assigned lipids was calculated to select 16 lipids with top importance. Using the LASSO method, 7 features were selected based on a grouped LASSO penalty. The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve for early and late stage cancer versus normal subjects using the selected lipid features was 0.85 and 0.88 for RF and 0.79 and 0.77 for LASSO, respectively. These results show the value of RF and LASSO for metabolomics data-based biomarker development, which provide robust an independent classifiers with sparse data sets.

Ability to quantify age-related PD could provide insights into biological mechanisms underlying the aging process. One approach to measuring PD exploits the fact that increasing PD manifests as a gradual deviation of physiological parameters away from normal levels. A recent geometric approach for quantifying PD uses Mahalanobis distance to measure the extent to which an individual's physiological parameters (measured via biomarkers from clinical blood biochemistry panels) deviate from normal levels. While useful, this approach has shortcomings that may impact its accuracy, primarily the incorrect assumption of multivariate normality among biomarkers, and identical weighting of biomarkers. Herein, we develop a more robust multivariate distance-based measure of PD. ::: ::: ::: METHOD ::: Proximity matrices induced by survival tree ensembles (Random Survival Forests) were used to compute a robust distance metric for quantifying how abnormal an individual's biomarker profile is. This approach requires no distributional assumptions and allows differential weighting of biomarkers based on association with mortality. Using receiver operating characteristic analysis and model fit statistics we compared performance of our measure to the standard approach based on Mahalanobis distance. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS & CONCLUSION ::: Our new metric showed statistically significant improvements in predicting mortality, health status and biological age, compared to the standard approach.

Because current experimental structure determination methods carry a high price tag, computational predictions are highly desirable. Given a protein sequence, computational methods produce numerous 3D structures known as decoys. However, selection of the best quality decoys is challenging as the end users can handle only a few ones. Therefore, scoring functions are central to decoy selection. They combine measurable features into a single number indicator of decoy quality. Unfortunately, current scoring functions do not consistently select the best decoys. Machine learning techniques offer great potential to improve decoy scoring. This paper presents two machine-learning based scoring functions to predict the quality of proteins structures, i.e., the similarity between the predicted structure and the experimental one without knowing the latter. We use different metrics to compare these scoring functions against three state-of-the-art scores. This is a first attempt at comparing different scoring functions using the same non-redundant dataset for training and testing and the same features.

The popular methods for UPRID are divided into clustering based and transfer learning based approaches. However, both of them either lack pre-knowledge or some useless knowledge transfered, which always achieves poor matching performance. Specifically, transfer learning based methods can utilize existing labeled data to boost the training of unlabeled data in target domain. Nevertheless, they generally offer weaker re-identification performance because there are a lot of negative images in source domain bringing negative effect on accuracy for the target domain, which is very challenging to address this negative source data removing problem.

Consider a fairly simple task where a robot has to pick up a spoon from a table. Many things can and do go wrong. The object being grasped may have been misclassified as a spoon. The position and orientation of the spoon may not be accurately determined by the recognition system. The table may get disturbed during the grasp operation. The spoon may be outside the robot\u2019s workspace. Traditional planners handle these \"error\" situations as special cases by monitoring the environment as the pre-planned actions execute, and replanning when an unexpected state is detected [14]. The possibility of error is not considered during planning, but postponed until the execution of the plan. At the other extreme, stimulus-response systems [2] have no internal expectations of the world as they generate responses to observed stimuli. Since a predicted model of the world is not maintained, \"error\" situations never arise. Reactive planners attempt to combine the two approaches into one by generating new plans at execution time as a reaction to the unexpected [1, 9, 6, 4, 5]. Our interest is in reactive planners that are embedded in the task execution system and handle error situations implicitly. Given a task and a particular state of the environment the system uses decision-theoretic methods to select and execute the action most likely to achieve a state closest to the goal state. This selection is based not only upon what the effects of an action are, but ~lso on the chances that the action will succeed in achieving those effects [4]. Consider for example, the task of picking up some food for feeding a person. A spoon or a fork can be used. When there is uncertainty associated with the food pickup operation, the planner should consider the chance of success when using the spoon or the fork, and make a choice on the basis of this knowledge. The planner described in this paper selects actions based on their expected utility (defined .as the product of the action\u2019s desirability and its probability of success, given the existing state of the domain) in achieving the desirable effects [12]. As this action selection process continues, the goals of the task are achieved and thereafter, maintained. If an action does not produce the expected environment (the promise of which made the action desirable), the action with the next highest utility is attempted. This may correspond to an alternate plan which was considered less likely to succeed. When such alternatives are absent (or have a very low chance of working) the same action will be retried. This process of action selection not only handles errors, but also serendipitous situations, where a highly desirable action that was unexecutable till then, suddenly finds itself executable due an unexpected change in the environment. The obvious drawback of mixing planning with execution is that backtracking is not possible. However, unlike reactive systems, the planner can anticipate and avoid potential conflicts between actions by predicting how actions affect future states. In our framework, uncertainty in the domain is represented by extending the definition of classical STRIPS operators to have probability values associated with the preconditions and effects of actions. The planning framework that incorporates these probabilities is introduced in Section 2. Section 3 develops and provides a formal description of a planning algorithm which considers the probability of a plan\u2019s success. Examples of planning behavior are shown in Section 5. It is also important for real-world planning algorithms to include mechanisms that combat the computational complexity inherent in search. Connectionist systems have shown how a multitude of simple processing nodes can tackle this problem in parallel [11]. The planning algorithm described here lends itself well to implementation as a connectionist system. Actions and propositions form the nodes of this network, with directed links representing the relation between them. Communication is only between neighboring nodes, through bidirectional spreading activation. Domain knowledge is represented by the strengths of the links between the nodes.

In order to solve the proposed problem, an algorithm is developed to jointly identify a graph and a graph-based filter (GBF) from multiple signal/data observations. Our algorithm is valid under the assumption that GBFs are one-to-one functions. The proposed approach can be applied to learn diffusion (heat) kernels, which are popular in various fields for modeling diffusion processes.

A major breakthrough in elucidating the genetic architecture of mood disorders was anticipated with the advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, to date few susceptibility loci have been conclusively identified. The genetic etiology of mood disorders appears to be quite complex, and as a result, alternative approaches for analyzing GWAS data are needed. Recently, a polygenic scoring approach that captures the effects of alleles across multiple loci was successfully applied to the analysis of GWAS data in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (BP). However, this method may be overly simplistic in its approach to the complexity of genetic effects. Data mining methods are available that may be applied to analyze the high dimensional data generated by GWAS of complex psychiatric disorders. We sought to compare the performance of five data mining methods, namely, Bayesian Networks (BN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Radial Basis Function network (RBF), and Logistic Regression (LR), against the polygenic scoring approach in the analysis of GWAS data on BP. The different classification methods were trained on GWAS datasets from the Bipolar Genome Study (2,191 cases with BP and 1,434 controls) and their ability to accurately classify case/control status was tested on a GWAS dataset from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. The performance of the classifiers in the test dataset was evaluated by comparing area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC). BN performed the best of all the data mining classifiers, but none of these did significantly better than the polygenic score approach. We further examined a subset of SNPs in genes that are expressed in the brain, under the hypothesis that these might be most relevant to BP susceptibility, but all the classifiers performed worse with this reduced set of SNPs. The discriminative accuracy of all of these methods is unlikely to be of diagnostic or clinical utility at the present time. Further research is needed to develop strategies for selecting sets of SNPs likely to be relevant to disease susceptibility and to determine if other data mining classifiers that utilize other algorithms for inferring relationships among the sets of SNPs may perform better.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3306768", "pubmed_id": "22081063", "doi": "10.1097/YPG.0b013e32834dc40d", "venue": "Psychiatric genetics", "journal": "Psychiatric genetics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2058338438,103182884", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Psychology", "Biology", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["41341022", "5660828", "22176429", "13789282", "4340835", "1152351", "18414489", "28051509", "38905128", "36154022", "4074916", "4414367", "34259612", "6669059", "6265817", "2813425", "208043973", "24602529", "18074155", "9143192", "1873570", "5894410", "16792722", "210679616", "14429305", "13336199", "386246", "62333196", "205344192", "1578191", "325983", "2022096", "17210997"], "inbound_citations": ["59143968", "6567650", "86792515", "215418717", "15850826", "211056904", "89675126", "210323", "36524487", "851492", "20370050", "51704344", "204849390", "64820047", "10140839"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4715436"}

In the second, we study the training of layered neural networks with sigmoidal activations for the purpose of regression. In both cases, the target, i.e., the classification or regression scheme, is considered to change continuously while the system is trained from a stream of labeled data. We extend and apply methods borrowed from statistical physics which have been used frequently for the exact description of training dynamics in stationary environments. Extensions of the approach allow for the computation of typical learning curves in the presence of concept drift in a variety of model situations. First results are presented and discussed for stochastic drift processes in classification and regression problems. They indicate that LVQ is capable of tracking a classification scheme under drift to a non-trivial extent.

This study firstly analyzes the spectra difference between shadow and non-shadow classes so as to detect shadow-pixel. To classify the shadow pixels, Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) method was adopted to classify urban land-cover mapping, because it can reduce the influence resulted from different illumination intensity. Then, training samples were collected among different classes from the shadow pixels, and their Jeffries\u2013Matusita (J\u2013M) distance were computed to validate the spectral separability among classes, with the square distances of J\u2013M among classes all bigger than 1.9. Finally, Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier were used to classify all the shadow pixels as different land-cover types.

The goal of multi-target tracking is to recover the trajectories of all moving targets while maintain their identities consistent. Although this problem has been studied for several years, there still remain many challenges, such as illumination and appearance variation, occlusion, sudden change in motion, and unpredictable motion across cameras. Driven by necessity for multi-target tracking in surveillance cameras, in this dissertation, we proposed several tracking methods.First, we designed a framework for multi-target tracking in a single camera. Unlike previous methods that only rely on low-level information, and consider each target as an independent agent, in this dissertation, an online learned social grouping behavior model is used to provide more robust tracklets affinities. A disjoint grouping graph is used to encode social grouping behavior of pairwise targets, where each node represents an elementary group of two targets, and two nodes are connected if they share a common target. Probabilities of the uncertain target in two connected nodes being the same person are inferred from each edge of the grouping graph. Second, a novel reference set based appearance model is developed to improve multi-target tracking across cameras. A reference set is constructed for a pair of cameras, containing subjects appearing in both camera views. For track association, instead of directly comparing the appearance of two targets in different camera views, they are compared indirectly via the reference set. Third, we extend the single camera multi-target tracking framework with social grouping behavior to a network of non-overlapping cameras. The tracking problem is formulated using an online learned Conditional Random Field (CRF) model that minimizes a global energy cost. During intra-camera tracking, track associations that maintain single camera grouping consistencies are preferred.To validate the proposed methods in this dissertation, extensive experiments on several datasets are conducted. Results show that each of the aforementioned method achieves state-of-the-art performance in various multi-target tracking tasks.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2788342635", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7953323"}

In this paper, we propose a modified Maximum Margin One Class SVM method as a discriminative framework to deal with multiclass problems. To this end, we present Maximum Margin One Class SVM coupled with the constraints of binary SVM detection (OC\"2). For each class, we aim to define a closed boundary around the target class such that the corresponding domain includes the target class elements as much as possible, while it minimizes the chance of accepting outliers and objects from the other classes. Because of the closure of decision boundaries, our method also allows detection of data belonging to potentially new clusters. Within the framework of decomposition methods and to deal with large data sets, we introduce a fast algorithm for optimizing OC\"2 which uses an efficient heuristic for selecting the working set.

In this paper, we identify two major types of stance expressions that are linguistically distinct, and we propose a tailored dual-view adaptation network (DAN) to adapt these expressions across domains. The proposed model first learns a separate view for domain transfer in each expression channel and then selects the best adapted parts of both views for optimal transfer. We find that the learned view features can be more easily aligned and more stance-discriminative in either or both views, leading to more transferable overall features after combining the views.

In this Paper, a new iterative fuzzy support vector machine algorithm (IFSVM) is proposed for severely imbalanced rail data classification with bootstrapping-based oversampling and undersampling.

The absence of these marks constitute a real problem in the automatic processing of these data by NLP tools. Indeed, writing Arabic without diacritics introduces several types of ambiguity. First, a word without diacratics could have many possible meanings depending on their diacritization. Second, undiacritized surface forms of an Arabic word might have as many as 200 readings depending on the complexity of its morphology [12]. In fact, the agglutination property of Arabic might produce a problem that can only be resolved using diacritics. Third, without diacritics a word could have many possible parts of speech (POS) instead of one. This is the case with the words that have the same spelling and POS tag but a different lexical sense, or words that have the same spelling but different POS tags and lexical senses [8]. Finally, there is ambiguity at the grammatical level (syntactic ambiguity). In this article, we propose the first work that investigates the automatic diacritization of Tunisian Dialect texts. We first describe our annotation guidelines and procedure. Then, we propose two major models, namely a statistical machine translation (SMT) and a discriminative model as a sequence classification task based on Conditional Random Fields (CRF). In the second approach, we integrate POS features to influence the generation of diacritics. Diacritics restoration was performed at both the word and the character levels. The results showed high scores of automatic diacritization based on the CRF system (Word Error Rate (WER) 21.44% for CRF and WER 34.6% for SMT).", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3297278", "venue": "TALLIP", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2957234659", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["8274306", "5331574", "11768999", "16058519", "43219808", "31560671", "16571013", "7789079", "5955831", "1802603", "5924849", "4064082", "7274230", "27387420", "11696905", "12632714", "59347172", "11729259", "14897470", "33972441", "62654321", "6027155", "12096945", "794019", "61477052", "277918", "17460746", "584912", "46786338", "4915036", "11851475", "4912554", "5219389", "6398894", "18570189", "208071111", "1988103", "14053197", "42266543", "30753757", "14100450", "16627616", "40515664", "9517956", "63864925", "44846579"], "inbound_citations": ["209525496"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199339294"}

Hence, it is necessary to develop an intellectual framework to recover the possible information presented in the original scene. In this article, we propose a kernel free framework based on conditional-GAN to recover the information from the heavily damaged images. The degradation of images is assumed to be occurred by the combination of a various blur. Learning parameter of the cGAN is optimized by multi-component loss function that includes improved wasserstein loss with regression loss function.

The total of 23 variables calculated from the distance of facial features are used as the input for the classification process, with the output of seven categories, such as: angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise. Some test cases were made to test the system, in which each test cases has different amount of data, ranging from 165\u2013520 training data. The result for each algorithm is quite satisfying with the accuracy of 75.15% for K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), 80% for Support Vector Machine (SVM), and 76.97% for Random Forests algorithm, tested using test case with the smallest amount of data. As for the result using the largest amount of data, the accuracy is 98.85% for KNN, 90% for SVM, and 98.85% for Random Forests algorithm. The training data for each test case was also classified using Discriminant Analysis with the result 97.7% accuracy.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ISEMANTIC.2016.7873831", "venue": "2016 International Seminar on Application for Technology of Information and Communication (ISemantic)", "journal": "2016 International Seminar on Application for Technology of Information and Communication (ISemantic)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2592074753", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["8693566", "15443221", "2443126", "20916156", "46144287", "123244804", "11613255", "4787497"], "inbound_citations": ["56068900", "214692267", "204816312", "71150427", "208277709", "129945473", "54450892"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16070543"}

In this research, we investigate human action recognition in still images and utilize deep ensemble learning to automatically decompose the body pose and perceive its background information. Firstly, we construct an end-to-end NCNN-based model by attaching the nonsequential convolutional neural network (NCNN) module to the top of the pretrained model. The nonsequential network topology of NCNN can separately learn the spatial- and channel-wise features with parallel branches, which helps improve the model performance. Subsequently, in order to further exploit the advantage of the nonsequential topology, we propose an end-to-end deep ensemble learning based on the weight optimization (DELWO) model. It contributes to fusing the deep information derived from multiple models automatically from the data. Finally, we design the deep ensemble learning based on voting strategy (DELVS) model to pool together multiple deep models with weighted coefficients to obtain a better prediction.

TPpred is trained on a non-redundant dataset of proteins where the presence of a target peptide was experimentally validated, comprising 297 sequences. When tested on the 297 positive and some other 8010 negative examples, TPpred outperformed available methods in both accuracy and Matthews correlation index (96% and 0.58, respectively). Given its very low-false-positive rate (3.0%), TPpred is, therefore, well suited for large-scale analyses at the proteome level. We predicted that from \u223c4 to 9% of the sequences of human, Arabidopsis thaliana and yeast proteomes contain targeting peptides and are, therefore, likely to be localized in mitochondria and plastids. TPpred predictions correlate to a good extent with the experimental annotation of the subcellular localization, when available. TPpred was also trained and tested to predict the cleavage site of the organelle-targeting peptide: on this task, the average error of TPpred on mitochondrial and plastidic proteins is 7 and 15 residues, respectively.

This is achieved by the proposed K-nearest output profiles algorithm, while adaptation during learning consists of gradually updating the knowledge embedded in the base classifiers, by processing previously unobserved data. This phase employs two types of incremental learning: local and global. Local incremental learning involves updating the pool of base classifiers by adding new members to this set. The new members are created with the Learn++ algorithm. Global incremental learning, in contrast, consists of updating the set of output profiles used during generalization. The proposed framework has been evaluated on a diversified set of databases. The results indicate that LoGID is promising. For most databases, the recognition rates achieved by the proposed method are higher than those achieved by other state-of-the-art approaches, such as batch learning.

In the research of transfer learning, knowledge should be transferred from the source domain to the target domain. The source domain is used to train a classifier while the target domain is for testing. Existing works consider the source domain as a whole, however, samples in the source domain might be extracted into different groups and the samples in the same group would have similar intrinsic attributes. In this work, we propose a novel transfer metric learning framework based on multi-group, called TMLMG. In TMLMG, based on each group both a Mahalanobis distance metric and a basic classifier are learned to make predictions. A weight matrix is used to describe the prediction capabilites of all the combinations of groups and Mahalanobis distance metrics. The weight matrix is initialized and optimized based on the labeled samples in the target domain. Experimental results on publicly available datasets of object recognition and handwriting recognition verify the effectiveness of our proposed TMLMG in knowledge transfer.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ROBIO.2018.8665258", "venue": "2018 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)", "journal": "2018 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2921446534", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["206724965", "4385295", "11484976", "740063", "3761015", "1880767", "3163031", "1157342", "30127350", "206595370", "15444951", "60697037", "12027077", "11193591", "2261947", "2745878", "16496273", "2473565", "9133542", "29153890"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:77374920"}

Methods : We propose a novel approach to align EEG trials from different subjects in the Euclidean space to make them more similar, and hence improve the learning performance for a new subject. Our approach has three desirable properties: first, it aligns the EEG trials directly in the Euclidean space, and any signal processing, feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms can then be applied to the aligned trials; second, its computational cost is very low; and third, it is unsupervised and does not need any label information from the new subject. Results : Both offline and simulated online experiments on motor imagery classification and event-related potential classification verified that our proposed approach outperformed a state-of-the-art Riemannian space data alignment approach, and several approaches without data alignment. Conclusion : The proposed Euclidean space EEG data alignment approach can greatly facilitate transfer learning in BCIs.

Effective use of nematicides at a variable rate is the only economic counter measure. It requires the nematode population in the field to be known, which in turn depends on the collection of soil samples from the field and analyzing them in the laboratory. This process is economically prohibitive. Hence there is a need to develop alternative methods through which the actual numbers of reniform nematode present in the field can be determined. In this paper we propose a methodology in which a canopy reflectance model (PROSAIL) is inverted using machine learning approaches to retrieve the biophysical parameters, and relate the key variables to the nematode levels, so that it is possible to quantify at all multi-temporal intervals the nematode infestation at geographically distributed fields. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) Regression method is used for the inversion and retrieval of key biophysical parameters which help to understand and quantify the nature of the nematode infested vegetation. The performance of this approach is analyzed by the accuracy measures of RMSE and N-fold cross validation average on a considerable data set.

We used a towed, undulating underwater imaging system to investigate the physical and biological drivers of zoo- and ichthyoplankton aggregations at the edge of a decaying mesoscale eddy (ME) in the Straits of Florida. Using a sparse Convolutional Neural Network we identified 132 million images of plankton. Larval fish and Oithona spp. copepod concentrations were significantly higher in the eddy water mass, compared to the Florida Current water mass, only four days before the ME's dissipation. Larval fish and Oithona distributions were tightly coupled, indicating potential predator-prey interactions. Larval fishes are known predators of Oithona, however, Random Forests models showed that Oithona spp. and larval fish concentrations were primarily driven by variables signifying the physical footprint of the ME, such as current speed and direction.

Unlike previous methods, we learn the best global associations instead of the best local affinities between tracklets, and transform the task of finding the best association into an energy minimization problem. A RankBoost algorithm is proposed to select effective features for estimation of term costs in the CRF model, so that better associations have lower costs.

Traditional CRF models, however, are incapable of selecting relevant features as well as suppressing noise from noisy original features. Moreover, conventional optimization methods often converge slowly in solving the training procedure of CRFs, and will degrade significantly for tasks with a large number of samples and features. In this paper, we propose robust CRFs (RCRFs) to simultaneously select relevant features. An optimal gradient method (OGM) is further designed to train RCRFs efficiently. Specifically, the proposed RCRFs employ the $\\ell _{1}$ norm of the model parameters to regularize the objective used by traditional CRFs, therefore enabling discovery of the relevant unary features and pairwise features of CRFs. In each iteration of OGM, the gradient direction is determined jointly by the current gradient together with the historical gradients, and the Lipschitz constant is leveraged to specify the proper step size. We show that an OGM can tackle the RCRF model training very efficiently, achieving the optimal convergence rate $O(1/k^{\\vphantom {R^{R^{.}}}2})$ (where $k$ is the number of iterations). This convergence rate is theoretically superior to the convergence rate $O(1/k)$ of previous first-order optimization methods.

The presence of new classes as well as the novelties caused by data errors can severely affect the performance of classifiers. Traditional proximity-based approaches usually utilize the distance to measure the proximity of different samples. In this study, we propose a framework that uses ensemble learning to detect novelty based on Random Forest (RF). The proposed framework is based on the observation that an ensemble of classifiers can provide a kind of metric to characterize different classes and measure their proximity. In particular, we apply ensemble methods with the decision tree as base classifiers and present two specific approaches, RFV and RFP, based on random forest. RFV uses the vote distribution of RF on a testing sample, and RFP takes the proximity matrix of RF as a special kernel metric to discover the novelty.

Using second-order calculus of variations, we derive a formula that provides the condition for IB phase transitions, and draw its connection with the Fisher information matrix for parameterized models. We provide two perspectives to understand the formula, revealing that each IB phase transition is finding a component of maximum (nonlinear) correlation between X and Y orthogonal to the learned representation, in close analogy with canonical-correlation analysis (CCA) in linear settings. Based on the theory, we present an algorithm for discovering phase transition points.

SDA of BDS is the problem of analyzing, modeling and extracting information from huge amounts of data that continuously come from several sources in real time through computational aware solutions. Among others, CBM for Rail Transportation is one of the most challenging SDA problems, consisting of the implementation of a predictive maintenance system for evaluating the future status of the monitored assets in order to reduce risks related to failures and to avoid service disruptions. The challenge is to collect and analyze all the data streams that come from the numerous on-board sensors monitoring the assets. This paper deals with the problem of CBM applied to the condition monitoring and predictive maintenance of train axle bearings based on sensors data collection, with the purpose of maximizing their Remaining Useful Life (RUL).

It is capable of detecting many kinds of land cover change continuously as new images are collected and providing land cover maps for any given time. A two-step cloud, cloud shadow, and snow masking algorithm is used for eliminating \u201cnoisy\u201d observations. A time series model that has components of seasonality, trend, and break estimates surface reflectance and brightness temperature. The time series model is updated dynamically with newly acquired observations. Due to the differences in spectral response for various kinds of land cover change, the CCDC algorithm uses a threshold derived from all seven Landsat bands. When the difference between observed and predicted images exceeds a threshold three consecutive times, a pixel is identified as land surface change. Land cover classification is done after change detection. Coefficients from the time series models and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from model estimation are used as input to the Random Forest Classifier (RFC). We applied the CCDC algorithm to one Landsat scene in New England (WRS Path 12 and Row 31). All available (a total of 519) Landsat images acquired between 1982 and 2011 were used. A random stratified sample design was used for assessing the change detection accuracy, with 250 pixels selected within areas of persistent land cover and 250 pixels selected within areas of change identified by the CCDC algorithm. The accuracy assessment shows that CCDC results were accurate for detecting land surface change, with producer's accuracy of 98% and user's accuracies of 86% in the spatial domain and temporal accuracy of 80%. Land cover reference data were used as the basis for assessing the accuracy of the land cover classification.

Accuracy metrics\u2014confusion matrix, overall accuracy, and kappa coefficient calculated through 10-fold cross-validation approach\u2014were used for quantitative comparison of MCD43A4 and MOD09A1/MOY09A1 products. The cross-validation results indicated better performance of the MCD43A4 (Overall accuracy = 0.73; Kappa coefficient = 0.69) product than conventional MOD09A1/MOY09A1 products (Overall accuracy = 0.70; Kappa coefficient = 0.66) for the classification. McNemar\u2019s test was also used to confirm a significant difference (p-value = 0.0003) between MCD43A4 and MOD09A1/MOY09A1 products. Based on these results, by utilizing the MCD43A4 features, a new vegetation map was produced for all of Japan. The newly produced map showed better accuracy than the extant, MODIS Land Cover Type product (MCD12Q1) and Global Land Cover by National Mapping Organizations (GLCNMO) product in Japan.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4236/ars.2018.73011", "venue": null, "journal": "ARS", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2889866893", "mag_field_of_study": ["Art"], "outbound_citations": ["128894589", "45028242", "24489818", "128619277", "29252231", "43806533", "89141", "27189260", "43824992", "46226024", "129453262", "131804721"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:191552127"}

Watermark bits are embedded adaptively into the non-separable wavelet domain based on the Human Visual System (HVS) model trained by Support Vector Regression (SVR). Unlike conventional separable wavelet filter banks that limit the ability in capturing directional information, non-separable wavelet filter banks contain the basis elements oriented at a variety of directions and different filter banks are able to capture different detail information. After removing the high frequency components, the low frequency subband used for watermark embedding is more robust against noise and other distortions. In addition, owing to the good generalization ability of the support vector machine, watermark embedding strength can be adjusted according to the HVS value. The superiority of non-separable wavelet transform (DNWT) in capturing image features combined with the good generalization ability of support vector regression provide us with a promising way to design a more robust watermarking algorithm featuring a better trade-off between the robustness and imperceptivity, the main duality of watermarking algorithms. Experimental results show that the DNWT watermarking scheme is robust to noising, JPEG compression, and cropping. In particular, it is more resistant to JPEG compression and noise than the discrete separable wavelet transform based scheme.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-540-88906-9_60", "venue": "IDEAL", "journal": null, "mag_id": "1491469160", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["18845884", "1174051"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:23236612"}

Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a machine-learning algorithm which has been shown to be highly effective for automatic text categorisation. However, a problem with iterative training techniques such as SVM is that during their learning or training phase, they require the entire training collection to be held in main-memory; this is infeasible for large training collections such as DMOZ or large news wire feeds. In this paper, we show how inverted indexes can be used for scalable training in categorisation, and propose novel heuristics for a fast, accurate, and memory efficient approach. Our results show that an index can be constructed on a desktop workstation with little effect on categorisation accu-racy compared to a memory-based approach.

Although most of the phosphorylation sites discovered in protein sequences have been identified experimentally, the in vivo and in vitro discovery of the sites is an expensive, time-consuming and laborious task. Therefore, the development of computational methods for prediction of protein phosphorylation sites has drawn considerable attention. In this work, we present a kernel-based probabilistic Classification Relevance Units Machine (CRUM) for in silico phosphorylation site prediction. In comparison with the popular Support Vector Machine (SVM) CRUM shows comparable predictive performance and yet provides a more parsimonious model. This is desirable since it leads to a reduction in prediction run-time, which is important in predictions on large-scale data. Furthermore, the CRUM training algorithm has lower run-time and memory complexity and has a simpler parameter selection scheme than the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) learning algorithm. To further investigate the viability of using CRUM in phosphorylation site prediction, we construct multiple CRUM predictors using different combinations of three phosphorylation site features -- BLOSUM encoding, disorder, and amino acid composition. The predictors are evaluated through cross-validation and the results show that CRUM with BLOSUM feature is among the best performing CRUM predictors in both cross-validation and benchmark experiments. A comparative study with existing prediction tools in an independent benchmark experiment suggests possible direction for further improving the predictive performance of CRUM predictors.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3806113", "pubmed_id": "24163645", "doi": "10.1145/2432546.2432547", "venue": "SIAP", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2089574884", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["827469", "6800499", "12651390", "207165665", "17816618", "961425", "52874011", "205382931", "16928494", "7274514", "1611500", "34590277", "6278891", "17406543", "198120256", "64295966", "3214416", "455073", "35730151", "2951017", "7507217", "28131190", "7596571", "10792537", "13580681"], "inbound_citations": ["17688098"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13281726"}

Both issues have been independently studied in the literature, and a plethora of methods to address high dimensionality as well as class-imbalance has been proposed. The aim of this work is to simultaneously explore both issues, proposing a family of methods that select those attributes that are relevant for the identification of the target class in binary classification.

In this research work, a multidisciplinary team, made up of pathologists and engineers, presents a proof of concept on the use of HSI analysis in order to automatically detect human brain tumour tissue from pathological slides. The samples were acquired from four different patients diagnosed with high-grade gliomas. Based on the diagnosis provided by pathologists, a spectral library containing spectra from healthy and tumour tissues was created. Data were finally processed using three different supervised machine learning algorithms. Materials and methods: An acquisition system consisting of a HSI camera coupled to a microscope was developed to capture the hyperspectral images from pathology slides. The spectral sampling was done in the spectral range from 400 nm to 1000 nm with a spectral resolution of 2.8 nm. The biological samples consisted of biopsies of human brain tissue resected during surgery that followed a histological process, whereby tissue specimens were prepared for sectioning, staining and diagnosis. Only spectral characteristics of the data were taken into account. The inputs of the classifiers were the spectral signatures from healthy and tumour pixels. Three different supervised machine learning algorithms were employed: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forests (RF). Results: The automatic diagnosis provided by the supervised classifiers shows a very high discrimination rate between healthy and tumour tissue, with high specificity and sensitivity above 90.83% and 94.55% respectively. Although all classifiers provide an accurate discrimination between healthy and tumour tissue, ANN presents the most accurate results with a specificity of 98.72% and a sensitivity of 97.71%. Conclusions: This research work presents a proof of concept in the use of HSI for automatically detecting brain tumour tissue in pathological slides. HSI can obtain an accurate diagnosis without using the morphological features of tissues, being a suitable complement to the current analysis methods, assisting pathologists to analyse the slides without having to spend a long time in the examination of each sample.FUNDING: This work has been supported by the European Commission through the FP7 FET Open programme ICT- 2011.9.2, European Project HELICoiD \u201cHypErspectral Imaging Cancer Detection\u201d under Grant Agreement 618080.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1093/neuonc/nox036.133", "venue": null, "journal": "Neuro-oncology", "mag_id": "2608605911", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["208210569"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:80373827"}

This work offers a unique approach in predicting EPL match outcomes, i.e., win, lose or draw by considering top six teams in the league namely Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur over the span of four consecutive seasons from 2013 to 2016. Fifteen features were selected based on their relevance to the game. Six different Support Vector Machine (SVM) model variations viz. linear, quadratic, cubic, fine radial basis function (RBF), medium RBF, as well as course RBF were developed to predict the match outcomes. A five-fold cross-validation technique was employed whilst, a separate fresh data was supplied to the best model developed in evaluating the predictive efficacy of the model. It was demonstrated from the study that the linear SVM model provided an excellent prediction accuracy of 100% on both the trained as well as untrained data.

Addressing safety critical applications in industrial environments, we make the basic assumption that people wear reflective vests. In order to detect these vests and to discriminate them from other reflective material, we propose an approach based on a single camera equipped with an IR flash. The camera acquires pairs of images, one with and one without IR flash, in short succession. The images forming a pair are then related to each other through feature tracking, which allows to discard features for which the relative intensity difference is small and which are thus not believed to belong to a reflective vest. Next, the local neighbourhood of the remaining features is further analysed. First, a Random Forest classifier is used to discriminate between features caused by a reflective vest and features caused by some other reflective materials. Second, the distance between the camera and the vest features is estimated using a Random Forest regressor. The proposed system was evaluated in one indoor and two challenging outdoor scenarios.

Application of new fusion approaches using high-resolution satellite-based products, unlike ground-based observations, can provide accurate drought analysis.

The precipitation data from Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP), CPC Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP), CICS High-Resolution Optimal Interpolation Microwave Precipitation from Satellites (CHOMPS), Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), The second Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) and Global Land Data Assimilation System Version-2 (GLDAS-2) products is utilized in estimating nonparametric-SPI as a meteorological drought index versus ground-based observations analysis. To achieve more accurate drought estimation, ground-based observations are classified in different clusters based on K-means clustering algorithm. Five individual Artificial Intelligence (AI) models including Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), M5P model tree, Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) are developed for each cluster and their best results are used in fusion process. In addition, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization model is utilized to determine optimal weights in weighting methods. Estimation performance of all models are evaluated using statistical error indices of Mean Absolute Relative Error (MARE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and coefficient of determination (R2). Application of proposed methodology is verified over Fars province in Iran and the results are compared. Results showed that ORNESS-OWA method with lowest estimation error (MARE of 2.51% and R2 of 95%) had the superb performance in comparison with all other individual AI and fusion-based models.

Severe fires kill and consume large amounts of above- and belowground biomass and affect soils, resulting in long-lasting consequences for vegetation, aquatic ecosystem productivity and diversity, and other ecosystem properties. We analyzed the occurrence of, and trends in, satellite-derived burn severity across six ecoregions in the Southwest and Northwest regions of the United States from 1984 to 2006 using data from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity project. Using 1,024 fires from the Northwest (4,311,871 ha) and 497 fires from the Southwest (1,434,670 ha), we examined the relative influence of fine-scale topography and coarse-scale weather and climate on burn severity (the degree of change from before the fire to one year after) using the Random Forest machine learning algorithm. Together, topography, climate, and weather explained severe fire occurrence with classification accuracies ranging from 68% to 84%. Topographic variables were relatively more important predictors of severe fire occurrence than either climate or weather variables. Predictability of severe fire was consistently lower during years with widespread fires, suggesting that local control exerted by topography may be overwhelmed by regional climatic controls when fires burn in dry conditions. Annually, area burned severely was strongly correlated with area burned in all ecoregions (Pearson's correlation 0.86\u20130.97; p < 0.001), while the proportion of area burned severely was significantly correlated with area burned only in two ecoregions (p \u2264 0.037). During our short time series, only ecoregions in the Southwest showed evidence of a significant increase (p \u2264 0.036) in annual area burned and area burned severely, and annual proportion burned severely increased in just one of the three Southwest ecoregions. We suggest that predictive mapping of the potential for severe fire is possible, and will be improved with climate data at the scale of the topographic and Landsat-derived burn severity data. Although severity is a value-laden term implying negative ecosystem effects, we stress that severity can be objectively measured and recognize that high severity fire is an important ecological process within the historical range of variability in some ecosystems.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1890/ES11-00271.1", "venue": null, "journal": "Ecosphere", "mag_id": "2067004073", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["53702950", "89804701", "22656099", "13852732", "173985662", "498113", "1257573", "3062600", "201801229", "15533334", "91705209", "212684658", "6076571", "7492563", "130421804", "215568160", "12767160", "215584706", "16535693", "91127383", "18743389", "5639844", "53366067", "205144231", "55246349", "108561123", "88723854", "53695203", "2210496", "2886414", "85452693", "149744409", "128700435", "205143109", "88014790", "214868458", "90062091", "1825677", "52105764", "202926521", "53607885", "14732787", "171083919", "52085105", "126733283", "52859837", "4458020", "90015656", "21111960", "17595002", "89209286", "13908718", "210334714", "215720254", "8373457", "140201857", "49561418", "91070126", "437138", "86682339", "4751707", "18543677", "202861181", "131956829", "8261118", "215198779", "89037809", "1649964", "111378868", "361859", "56316751", "36846575", "53480293", "133306044", "18348375", "14599933", "129086458", "21851182", "8929818", "13851941", "15590301", "88332227", "3706203", "181642924", "215194966", "209673646", "134958577", "86409411", "20552798", "20552798", "91174464", "16721994", "51963272", "52088597", "33461849", "91257739", "1967502", "84918574", "215399147", "62787381", "13997251", "62791376", "16467709", "208555690", "53173704", "51965753", "82736375", "84956590", "91381047", "91381047", "90526076", "215183754", "7918402", "53463361", "129166122", "55733007", "46953181", "135384552", "55270522", "201802613", "10814351", "211016873"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:85229507"}

Therefore, an effective trade-off between information loss and computational cost can be achieved by using the latent variables of VAE as summary statistics of ABC, which overcomes the difficulty of selecting summary statistics in the ABC. Besides, for some practical engineering problems, processing the images as objective function can effective show the response result. Meanwhile, the relationship between design parameters and the latent variables is constructed by Least Squares Support Vector Regression (LSSVR) surrogate model. With the well-constructed LSSVR model, the simulation coefficient vectors under given parameters will be determined effectively. Then, the parameters to be identified are determined by comparing the simulated and observed coefficient vectors in ABC. Finally, a sheet forming problem is investgated by the suggested method.

The single classifiers employed in this research included Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and See 5 (C 5.0). The results indicated that classification performance improved (increased the mean overall accuracy by 5%~10%, and reduced standard deviation of overall accuracy by around 1%) substantially with the training sample number, and when the training sample size was small (50 or 100 training samples), hybrid classifiers substantially outperformed single classifiers with higher mean overall accuracy (1%~2%). However, when abundant training samples (4,000) were employed, single classifiers could achieve good classification accuracy, and all classifiers obtained similar performances. Additionally, although object-based classification did not improve accuracy, it resulted in greater visual appeal, especially in study areas with a heterogeneous cropping pattern.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4567051", "pubmed_id": "26360597", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0137748", "venue": "PloS one", "journal": "PloS one", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2179483882", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["5496119", "24053603", "205656533", "5713883", "6409516", "129590751", "205657085", "14767463", "2357415", "89141", "9985555", "14591318", "129804999", "12278296", "17068199", "62175933", "52063785", "53361605", "21954269", "6604508", "129914394", "18451813", "6906514", "18811894", "119702334", "2971919", "38395910", "155054130", "59849217", "129249527", "123616348", "17883484", "86625815", "7628420", "1830567", "122766877"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:975627"}

Their abundance and ubiquity combined with a relatively low quantity of their annotations motivate research toward the development of computational models that predict disordered regions from protein sequences.

MFDp is as an ensemble of 3 Support Vector Machines specialized for the prediction of short, long and generic disordered regions. It combines three complementary disorder predictors, sequence, sequence profiles, predicted secondary structure, solvent accessibility, backbone dihedral torsion angles, residue flexibility and B-factors. Our method utilizes a custom-designed set of features that are based on raw predictions and aggregated raw values and recognizes various types of disorder. The MFDp is compared at the residue level on two datasets against eight recent disorder predictors and top-performing methods from the most recent CASP8 experiment. In spite of using training chains with \u226425% similarity to the test sequences, our method consistently and significantly outperforms the other methods based on the MCC index. The MFDp outperforms modern disorder predictors for the binary disorder assignment and provides competitive real-valued predictions. The MFDp's outputs are also shown to outperform the other methods in the identification of proteins with long disordered regions. ::: ::: Availability: http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/MFDp.html ::: ::: Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. ::: ::: Contact: lkurgan@ece.ualberta.ca", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2935446", "pubmed_id": "20823312", "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btq373", "venue": "Bioinformatics", "journal": "Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2169802764", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["40589986", "25366839", "383107", "1682811", "1181830", "18068406", "3116168", "18378845", "400254", "9484865", "14011584", "8731372", "38799735", "6081008", "1971642", "40872666", "25366839", "3214416", "2841548", "8553663", "6451481", "15489990", "17716035", "3828246", "18478554", "155100544", "1330175", "52820584", "613940", "205469338", "39158533", "6173514", "38582565", "28406967", "16425690", "6118541"], "inbound_citations": ["2282998", "207913091", "189317453", "85518489", "2873325", "205968795", "111380685", "15388749", "15788609", "88559983", "3762007", "18060440", "215565818", "1853594", "196188138", "20720425", "3703781", "56132960", "49303840", "34035959", "215180974", "8802468", "16552938", "53235372", "1010995", "215094491", "195671865", "3807036", "16013907", "17380116", "15808784", "623292", "52945944", "215064625", "5354879", "14984826", "18523541", "555391", "26190777", "4318375", "20615961", "17463838", "54458213", "31483068", "1148400", "7084684", "215093037", "6700404", "7257260", "92678664", "45778186", "215685833", "16128935", "18782220", "21229963", "19692124", "215289193", "52898468", "13883311", "52071837", "6091681", "14617272", "15525597", "1524120", "215232114", "16812460", "7049063", "7638704", "14082750", "10212877", "104338150", "22179720", "24035777", "36023778", "38597868", "23912006", "109603574"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9371343"}

The global prognosis results including KPI prediction and process monitoring are obtained from the corresponding normalized weighted means of all the local models. The statistical indicators for prognosis are enhanced as well by the design of novel KPI-related and KPI-unrelated statistics with suitable control limits for non-Gaussian data. For application-oriented purpose, the process measurements from real datasets of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell system are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of KPI prognosis.

The most effective way to match these pedestrians undertaking significant visual variations is to seek reliably invariant features that can describe the person of interest faithfully. Most of existing methods are presented in a supervised manner to produce discriminative features by relying on labeled paired images in correspondence. However, annotating pair-wise images is prohibitively expensive in labours, and thus not practical in large-scale networked cameras. Moreover, seeking comparable representations across camera views demands a flexible model to address the complex distributions of images. In this work, we study the co-occurrence statistic patterns between pairs of images, and propose to crossing Generative Adversarial Network (Cross-GAN) for learning a joint distribution for cross-image representations in an unsupervised manner. Given a pair of person images, the proposed model consists of the variational auto-encoder to encode the pair into respective latent variables, a proposed cross-view alignment to reduce the view disparity, and an adversarial layer to seek the joint distribution of latent representations.

Recently, deep learning based ST prediction models are proposed to learn the ST characteristics of data. However, it is still very challenging (1) to adequately learn the complex and non-linear ST relationships; (2) to model the high variations in the ST data volumes as it is inherently dynamic, changing over time (i.e., irregular) and highly influenced by many external factors, such as adverse weather, accidents, traffic control, PoI, etc.; and (3) as there can be many complicated external factors that can affect the accuracy and it is impossible to list them explicitly. To handle the aforementioned issues, in this paper, we propose a novel deep generative adversarial network based model (named, D-GAN) for more accurate ST prediction by implicitly learning ST feature representations in an unsupervised manner. D-GAN adopts a GAN-based structure and jointly learns generation and variational inference of data. More specifically, D-GAN consists of two major parts: (1) a deep ST feature learning network to model the ST correlations and semantic variations, and underlying factors of variations and irregularity in the data through the implicit distribution modelling; (2) a fusion module to incorporate external factors for reaching a better inference. To the best our knowledge, no prior work studies ST prediction problem via deep implicit generative model and in an unsupervised manner.

In the first part of this paper, we use transfer learning from English to English-paired code-switched languages for the language identification (LID) task by applying two simple yet effective techniques: 1) a hierarchical attention mechanism that enhances morphological clues from character n-grams, and 2) a secondary loss that forces the model to learn n-gram representations that are particular to the languages involved. We use the bottom layers of the ELMo architecture to learn these morphological clues by essentially recognizing what is and what is not English. Our approach outperforms the previous state of the art on Nepali-English, Spanish-English, and Hindi-English datasets. In the second part of the paper, we use our best LID models for the tasks of Spanish-English named entity recognition and Hindi-English part-of-speech tagging by replacing their inference layers and retraining them.

Enforcing quality-of-service in such cellular network is challenging, as radio phenomenon, as well as user (and their devices) mobility and dynamics, are uncontrolled. To solve this issue, estimating what the quality of transmissions will be in a short future for a connected user is essential. For that purpose, we argue that radio metrics are key features whose evolutions can help predicting the bandwidth that the considered connections can take advantage of in the following hundreds of milliseconds. The paper then describes how a 4G testbed has been deployed in order to study the correlation between radio noise and throughput in uplink transmissions. Based on radio measurements, the main supervised machine learning algorithms are used, such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machine to predict the uplink received bandwidth. For a specific user service, we are able to predict the end-to-end received bandwidth, i.e. the amount of received data on the server side during a specific period at a very low scale of 100 ms.

However, small sample size and low precision of multi-step prediction limits its application in battery RUL estimation for sparse RVM algorithm. Due to the continuous on-line update of monitoring data, to improve the prediction performance of battery RUL model, dynamic training and on-line learning capability is desirable.

We propose an Support Vector Machine (SVM) detection method to solve the significant distortion issue due to weak signal of the NLOS link. Experimental results on the second-order reflection-based VLC demonstrate that the detection error probability of the proposed SVM detection can be reduced up to at least two orders of magnitude compared with the Gaussian approximation-based detection, and can reach $10^{-4}$ at bit rate 4Mbps. Thus, low-data rate applications can be achieved by VLC with only the second-order reflection, which implies the potential in speech/image/control message transmission and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, for example the mobile robots that may operate in the shadow or even under a table. Experimental results on the second-order reflection at different transmission rates, different sampling rates, different AC signal amplitudes, and different DC voltages of bias-tee are also demonstrated.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/JPHOT.2019.2938178", "venue": "IEEE Photonics Journal", "journal": "IEEE Photonics Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2970054528", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": ["33682870", "3404549", "4817140", "22808445", "20804373", "4866084", "53757724", "15376631", "2755873", "1059994", "14629335", "14522657", "3691466", "53288212", "49566302", "52962737", "45013554", "27023701", "206631525"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202158427"}

To resolve this problem, previous studies have performed data augmentation that are based on geometric transforms and the adjustment of image brightness. Nevertheless, the data created by these methods have high correlation with the original data, and they cannot adequately reflect individual diversities. To resolve this problem, this study proposes iris image augmentation based on a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN), as well as a method for improving recognition performance that uses this augmentation method. In our method, normalized iris images that are generated through arbitrary changes in the iris and pupil coordinates are used as input in the cGAN-based model to generate iris images. Due to the limitations of the cGAN model, data augmentation, which uses the periocular region, was found to fail with regard to the improvement of performance. Based on this information, only the iris region was used as input for the cGAN model.

So the pricing on these products are not standardized as prices of these products is decided by the seller of those resale products. Since only resale products are sold on these websites, such websites do not have all the products and therefore there is no recommendation system on these websites.

After standardizing all the prices on the e-commerce website, a market basket based recommendation system is built for such e-commerce website.

CNN outperformed LGBM and ridge regression for predicting the price, the root mean squared logarithmic error value (rmsle) of CNN was 0.44, while LGBM was at 0.53 and ridge regression was at 0.47.

The building procedure of its base classifier (a decision tree) is principally based on a randomization process of data and features; and on a split criterion, which uses classic precise probabilities, to quantify the gain of information. One drawback found on this classifier is that it has a bad performance when it is applied on data sets with class noise. Very recently, it is proved that a new criterion which uses imprecise probabilities and general uncertainty measures, can improve the performance of the classic split criteria. In this work, the base classifier of the Random Forest is modified using that new criterion, producing also a new single decision tree model. This model join with the randomization process of features is the base classifier of a new procedure similar to the Random Forest, called Credal Random Forest. The principal differences between those two models are presented. In an experimental study, it is shown that the new method represents an improvement of the Random Forest when both are applied on data sets without class noise.

The multi-class T-SVM is augmented with ambient regularizer term and intrinsic regularizer term, assisting to form a smooth function for the model. Text comprehension from natural scene includes the localization, recognition, and reconstruction of the text. The work includes an additional module, revalidation that discards the false positives from the text objects detected during the localization phase. Then in recognition phase, each letter from the pool of text objects is identified for the appropriate class and provided as output to the text construction phase, which builds the text using the pool of coordinates associated with the object.

However, accurate segmentation results are difficult to achieve for automatic methods, due to sparse acquisition, inter-slice motion, and the widely varying position and shape of the placenta among pregnant women. Interactive methods have been widely used to get more accurate and robust results. A good interactive segmentation method should achieve high accuracy, minimize user interactions with low variability among users, and be computationally fast. Exploiting recent advances in machine learning, I explore a family of new interactive methods for placenta segmentation from fetal MR images. I investigate the combination of user interactions with learning from a single image or a large set of images. For learning from a single image, I propose novel Online Random Forests to efficiently leverage user interactions for the segmentation of 2D and 3D fetal MR images. I also investigate co-segmentation of multiple volumes of the same patient with 4D Graph Cuts. For learning from a large set of images, I first propose a deep learning-based framework that combines user interactions with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based on geodesic distance transforms to achieve accurate segmentation and good interactivity. I then propose image-specific fine-tuning to make CNNs adaptive to different individual images and able to segment previously unseen objects. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms outperform traditional interactive segmentation methods in terms of accuracy and interactivity. Therefore, they might be suitable for segmentation of the placenta in planning systems for fetal and maternal surgery, and for rapid characterization of the placenta by MR images.

With natural habitat of the endangered Panthera Tigris Tigris fast declining, coupled with factors such as loss in genetic diversity and disruption of ecological corridors, there is an urgent need to conserve and reintroduce it to newer geographic locations. The study aims to predict and model the distribution of the species Panthera Tigris Tigris by combining various climatic, human influence, and environmental factors so as to predict alternate ecological niche for the already dwindling tiger habitats in India. 19 Bioclimatic variables, Elevation level, 17 Land Cover classes, Population Density, and Human Footprint data were taken. MAXENT, SVM, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks were used for modeling. Sampling bias on the species was removed through spatial thinning. These variables were tested for Pearson correlation and those having coefficient greater than 0.70 were removed. Kappa statistic and AUC were used to study the results of the methodology implemented. Testing data comprises 25% of the presence only points and test AUC value of MAXENT was found to be the highest at 0.963, followed by RF at 0.931, ANN at 0.906, and lastly SVM at 0.898. These indicated a high degree of accuracy for prediction.

Our deep network, which we refer to as deep GCRF network, consists of two sub-networks: (i) a parameter generation network that generates the pairwise potential parameters based on the noisy input image, and (ii) an inference network whose layers perform the computations involved in an iterative GCRF inference procedure.\\ We train the entire deep GCRF network (both parameter generation and inference networks) discriminatively in an end-to-end fashion by maximizing the peak signal-to-noise ratio measure.

While most existing algorithms are able to track objects well in controlled environments, they usually fail in the presence of significant variation of the object's appearance or surrounding illumination. One reason for such failures is that many algorithms employ fixed appearance models of the target. Such models are trained using only appearance data available before tracking begins, which in practice limits the range of appearances that are modeled, and ignores the large volume of information (such as shape changes or specific lighting conditions) that becomes available during tracking. In this paper, we present a tracking method that incrementally learns a low-dimensional subspace representation, efficiently adapting online to changes in the appearance of the target. The model update, based on incremental algorithms for principal component analysis, includes two important features: a method for correctly updating the sample mean, and a forgetting factor to ensure less modeling power is expended fitting older observations. Both of these features contribute measurably to improving overall tracking performance. Numerous experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tracking algorithm in indoor and outdoor environments where the target objects undergo large changes in pose, scale, and

These applications involve a large number of examples n as well as a large number of features N, while each example has only s << N non-zero features. This paper presents a Cutting Plane Algorithm for training linear SVMs that provably has training time 0(s,n) for classification problems and o(sn log (n))for ordinal regression problems. The algorithm is based on an alternative, but equivalent formulation of the SVM optimization problem. Empirically, the Cutting-Plane Algorithm is several orders of magnitude faster than decomposition methods like svm light for large datasets.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id":

So, determination of output power and shaft torque with low uncertainty and high precision are required. In this paper, a new generation of intelligent models named \u201cleast square support vector machine (LSSVM)\u201d is employed to predict output power and shaft torque of stirling engines. To build, train and test the LSSVM model, various accurate experimental data from open literature are employed. The outputs of the LSSVM model are compared to experimental ones and statistical parameters of the LSSVM model including correlation coefficient, average absolute relative deviation (AARD) and root mean square error (RMSE) are calculated. According to the results obtained via LSSVM model, the LSSVM model can predict output power and shaft torque of Stirling heat engine with reasonable and acceptable accuracy.

We formulated a hybrid of 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) and generative adversarial network (GAN) to recover the complete voxelized 3D object. Furthermore, we incorporated a separate classifier in the GAN framework, making it a three player game instead of two which helps stabilize the training of the GAN as well as guides the shape completion process to follow the object class labels.

Second, the region of interest (ROI) is detected and cropped by palmprint verification system. This ROI acts as the base for palmprint feature extraction by using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Lastly, the matching scores of the two individual classifiers is fused by several fusion algorithms namely sum rule, weighted sum rule and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results of the fusion algorithms are being compared with the outcomes of the individual palm and hand geometry classifiers. We are able to show that fusion using SVM with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel has outperformed other combined and individual classifiers.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/982507.982526", "venue": "WBMA '03", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2100743375", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["1301899", "14721456", "7859374", "1991617", "2205113", "17285868", "14776492", "28525649", "206421748", "20993687", "57577270", "124794109", "139431002"], "inbound_citations": ["10687693", "14013059", "16301101", "9204189", "15881858", "10920572", "6253957", "3007148", "9251034", "16706985", "18276920", "14625924", "29874514", "2641631", "22254079", "13501157", "16676215", "43715489", "1957008", "211208728", "10122967", "129030077", "18992038", "6128119", "125592902"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3096755"}

The performance of ATR system depends on many factors, such as the characteristics of input data, feature extraction methods, and classification algorithms. Generally speaking, ATR performance evaluation can be performed either theoretically or empirically. The theoretical evaluation method requires reasonably accurate underlying models for characterizing target/clutter data, which in many cases is unavailable. The empirical (experimental) evaluation method, on the other hand, needs a fairly large data set in order to conduct meaningful experimental tests. In this paper, we present experimental performance evaluation of ATR algorithms using the Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) data set. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the ATR performance under different operating conditions. In the experimental tests, different feature extraction techniques, Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and kernel PCA, are employed on target SAR imagery to reduce the feature dimension. A number of classification approaches, Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine are tested and compared for their classification accuracy under different conditions such as various feature dimensions, target classes, feature selection methods and input data quality.

The three networks were trained using the same number of brain CT images available.

The baseline VA before the first injection was 0.54 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) (\u00b10.39).

First, we formulate a historical load matrix (HLM) with spatiotemporal correlation combined with the EI scenario and then create a three-dimensional historical load tensor (HLT) that contains the HLMs for multiple consecutive time points before the forecasted hour. Second, we preprocess the HLT leveraging a novel low rank decomposition algorithm and different load gradients, aiming to provide a forecasting model with richer input data. Third, we develop a deep forecasting framework (called the 3D CNN-GRU) featuring a feature learning module followed by a regression module, in which the 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN) is used to extract the desired feature sequences with time attributes, while the gated recurrent unit (GRU) is responsible for mapping the sequences to the forecast values. By feeding the corresponding load label into the 3D CNN-GRU, our proposed scheme can carry out forecasting tasks for any zone covered by the HLM.

The system is able to learn representations of data that are ordered in regards to the saliency of the attributes, in a completely unsupervised manner. The training strategy expands the latent space dimension while appropriately adding capacity to the model in a controlled way. This builds on the intuition that highly salient attributes are easiest to learn first. Empirical results on the Swiss roll dataset show that the representation is structured in regards to the saliency of the attributes when training the latent space progressively on a very simple GAN architecture. Experiments using a more complex system, trained on the CelebA dataset, scales the idea to a more interesting use case. Experiments using latent space interpolations show that our model successfully structures the latent space with respect to the saliency of the attributes, while also generating at least as real looking images and in less training time, than state-of-the-art methods.

Existing methods lack the ability to generate perceptually plausible images. In this work, we present a novel method to alleviate this problem by leveraging generative adversarial training to synthesize an eye image conditioned on a target gaze direction. Our method ensures perceptual similarity and consistency of synthesized images to the real images. Furthermore, a gaze estimation loss is used to control the gaze direction accurately. To attain high-quality images, we incorporate perceptual and cycle consistency losses into our architecture. In extensive evaluations we show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both image quality and redirection precision.

In the existing system, the mobile robot navigates in a known environment on a predefined path. However, the pervasive presence of uncertainty in sensing and learning, makes the choice of a suitable tool of reasoning and decision-making that can deal with incomplete information, vital to ensure a robust control system. This problem can be overcome by the proposed navigation method using fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM). It proposes a fuzzy logic-based support vector machine (SVM) approach to secure a collision-free path avoiding multiple dynamic obstacles. The navigator consists of an FSVM-based collision avoidance. The decisions are taken at each step for the mobile robot to attain the goal position without collision. Fuzzy-SVM rule bases are built, which require simple evaluation data rather than thousands of input-output training data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a series of simulations and implemented with a microcontroller for navigation.

Under 365 nm UV LED illumination, using these three systems, three hypersepctral datasets of 45, 41 and 73 peanut samples before and after aflatoxin contaminated have be collected separately. In order to select the best key wavelengths, four feature selection methods (Fisher, SPA, BestFist and Ranker) and four classifier models (KNN, SVM, BP-ANN, RandomForest) were analyzed and compared. Using all selected wavelengths based on different datasets, a weighted voting method was proposed and 10 key wavelengths (440 380 410 460 420 370 450 490 700 600 nm) were selected. Based on the best model (Random Forest), the best integrated average recognition rate is 94.5%. And then, using these key wavelengths and the best classification model, a new design system for aflatoxin sorter base on a Ploygon mirror was proposed. The structure of this system is simple, detection accuracy is high, which can be applied to online sorting of aflatoxin detection.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.compag.2018.08.018", "venue": "Comput.

To improve usefulness of the latent space, this paper focuses on disentangled representation learning like $\\beta$-VAE, which is the baseline for it. Starting from the viewpoint of Tsallis statistics, a new lower bound of the q-VAE is derived to maximize likelihood of the data sampled. This can be regarded as an adaptive $\\beta$-VAE with a deformed Kullback-Leibler divergence. To verify benefits from the q-VAE, a benchmark task to extract the latent space from MNIST dataset is performed. It is found that the q-VAE improved the disentangled representation while not deteriorating reconstruction accuracy of the data. As another advantage of the q-VAE, it does not require independency between the data. This advantage is demonstrated in learning latent dynamics of a nonlinear dynamical simulation.

If the classes are modeled with the convex hulls of their samples the result is the standard SVM, but many other convex models are possible.

The second sub chapter makes an overview of a wind maintenance system, describing in detail the software related to the acquisition system, the information system and other software. This sub chapter explains also the operation of the acquisition system, including algorithms, hardware and firmware details. The third sub chapter deals with algorithms that manage the results of a methodology presented in the second sub chapter, with the objective to illustrate the operation of the system. The penultimate sub chapter will present results including simulation and real operation of the system, data details for clock synchronization protocols with improved changes, acquisition time and a SVM (Support Vector Machines) classifier applied to sensorial wind data. Finally we will make the chapter conclusions and present the references used in this chapter. The contribution of this chapter is in the design of the architecture proposed with emphasis for synchronous data acquisition in different geographic points. An improvement for PTP (Precision Time Protocol) is included to achieve fast time convergence in the initial phase of a clock synchronization setup. The control and setup of acquisition timings also play an important role in the system behaviour. This chapter also includes different alternatives for this subject. Given the current energy framework and global climate change, the emphasis on renewable energy has grown a lot. One of the most important renewable energies is from wind that has given great contribution for this new paradigm. There are, however, many aspects that must be considered and are related to its framework as an energy environmentally friendly. This growth in wind farms has the effect of the increase in diversity of the type of equipment in wind turbines. Moreover, the average life of each wind generator and readiness of this kind of technology means that there is a legacy of equipments for different ages and maintenance needs.

It requires that the generated image should inherit some domain-specific features of the conditional image from the target domain.

Despite such knowledge representations being crucial to a wide range of knowledge-driven applications, state-of-the-art methods are limited to learning embeddings for simple relation facts in a single knowledge graph. In this dissertation, we pursue the goal of comprehensively capturing the multifaceted relational knowledge in various types of knowledge bases, and towards that we contribute on three fronts: (i) we introduce the first multi-relational representation learning framework that learns to transfer embeddings across multiple knowledge bases; (ii) we propose techniques for preserving relational facts with complex properties in the embedding space, including those enforce relational properties, form hierarchies, or endowed uncertainty; (iii) we investigate large-scale relational learning based on other modalities of data, with the aim of acquiring knowledge to enrich the knowledge bases.Each of these three research problems presents a series of key challenges which we address. Thus, for transferred embeddings, we develop joint learning of relational structure encoders that confront the heterogeneity of contents in knowledge graphs, together with diverse types of alignment models that learn to transfer on the basis of simple, hierarchical or fuzzy alignment information. In addition, we extend the joint learning framework with semi-supervised co-training of entity descriptions, and proactive score propagation for fuzzy alignment, so as to conquer the scenarios where alignment information is limitedly provided. To capture complex relation facts, we focus first on the relational properties that cause non-linearity in embedding structures, for which we leverage a non-linear component-specific mappings of embeddings to eliminate the conflicts, and strengthens the learning process with hierarchical regularization. For uncertain relation facts, we preserve the uncertainty by utilizing Probablistic Soft Logic to guide the non-linear regressor that is jointly trained with the structure encoder. We further study the support of relational learning based on sequence data. Our model proposes generic neural sequence pair models to support large-scale relation detection, in which we incorporate different sequence encoders for heterogeneous data such as structured articles, amino acid sequences, and lexicographic knowledge.The methods proposed in this dissertation extend the application of multi-relational embeddings, and improve a wide spectrum of applications in different domains. These include knowledge alignment, monolingual and cross-lingual knowledge graph completion, semantic search, entity typing, paraphrase identification, uncertain relation prediction, protein-protein interaction prediction, protein binding affinity estimation, single-cell RNA-sequence imputation, and Webscale sub-article matching.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2947774492", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["209513038"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:192545672"}

The limited availability of materials data can be addressed through transfer learning, while the generic representation was recently addressed by Xie and Grossman [1], where they developed a crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN) that provides a unified representation of crystals.

MT-CGCNN is able to reduce the test error when employed on correlated properties by upto 8%. The model prediction has lower test error compared to CGCNN, even when the training data is reduced by 10%.

Human organs show different symptoms depending on the type of health problem. Among human organs, skin has drawn much attention since it is the outermost part and hence easy to investigate. Skin condition is known to be analyzed and estimated using various features such as wrinkle and elasticity. In this paper, we propose an automatic skin aging evaluation scheme. More specifically, we first collect wrinkle- related features from subjects of different ages and dermatologists evaluate their aging level for the ground truth. And then, we train and compare non-linear, multi-class SVM (Support Vector Machine) using these datasets and ground truth for classification. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme, we performed experiments using the SVM. We report some of the result. I. INTRODUCTION & RELATED WORK Skin has drawn much attention for a long time, partially because it is the outermost part of our body and hence easy to investigate. It has been known that skin shows useful clues to evaluate the environmental and/or living condition of the subject. According to dermatologists, there exist some visual features on the human skin that can be used for evaluating its condition. However, there has been no standard for this purpose. At present, dermatologists observe the skin images of the subject and evaluate the skin condition based on their personal experience and expertise. We claim that if we collect their expertise and organize them using some classification tool, then automatic evaluation of skin condition is clinically feasible.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2317915152", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:111834681"}

Although great progress has been achieved with the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in synthesizing realistic images, most existing GAN-based face aging methods have two main problems: 1) unnatural changes of high-level semantic information (e.g. facial attributes) due to the insufficient utilization of prior knowledge of input faces, and 2) distortions of low-level image content including ghosting artifacts and modifications in age-irrelevant regions. In this paper, we introduce A3GAN, an Attribute-Aware Attentive face aging model to address the above issues. Facial attribute vectors are regarded as the conditional information and embedded into both the generator and discriminator, encouraging synthesized faces to be faithful to attributes of corresponding inputs. To improve the visual fidelity of generation results, we leverage the attention mechanism to restrict modifications to age-related areas and preserve image details. Moreover, the wavelet packet transform is employed to capture textural features at multiple scales in the frequency space.

Although most previous studies have inherently focused on state-specific characterizations of brain networks and their functions, several recent studies reported on the potential state-unspecific nature of functional brain networks, such as global similarities across different experimental conditions or states, including both task and resting states. However, no previous studies have carried out direct, systematic characterizations of state-unspecific brain networks, or their functional implications. Here, we quantitatively identified several modes of state-unspecific individual variations in whole-brain functional connectivity patterns, called \u201cCommon Neural Modes\u201d (CNMs), from a large-scale fMRI database including eight task/resting states. Furthermore, we tested how CNMs accounted for variability in individual cognitive measures. The results revealed that three CNMs were robustly extracted under various dimensions of features used. Each of these CNMs was preferentially correlated with different aspects of representative cognitive measures, reflecting stable individual traits. Importantly, the association between CNMs and cognitive measures emerged from brain connectivity data alone (\u201cunsupervised\u201d), whereas previous related studies have explicitly used both connectivity and cognitive measures to build their prediction models (\u201csupervised\u201d). The three CNMs were also able to predict several life outcomes, including income and life satisfaction, and achieved the highest level of performance when combined with a conventional cognitive measure.

We propose to use the spatial correlation of received signal strength (RSS) inherited from wireless nodes to detect the spoofing attacks. We then formulate the problem of determining the number of attackers as a multi-class detection problem. Cluster-based mechanisms are developed to determine the number of attackers. When the training data is available, we explore using Support Vector Machines (SVM) method to further improve the accuracy of determining the number of attackers.

The weaker setting avoids the order dependency problem of the strong notion when learning multiple predicates, extends the representation of the induced hypotheses to full clausal logic, and can be applied to different types of application.", "year": 1993, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/3-540-56804-2_41", "venue": "ISMIS", "journal": null, "mag_id": "1556909536", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["478280"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:36727299"}

It is shown to be a rich framework that can represent many existing illumination estimation solutions with various parameter settings. However, color constancy is an ill-posed problem; every algorithm is always given out under some assumptions and can only produce the best performance when these assumptions are satisfied. In this article, we have investigated a combination strategy relying on the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) technique that integrates the output of edge-based color constancy with multiple parameters.

Due to their extended notion of context, CRFs are able to take the global utterance context into account and are less constrained by local features than other realisers. This leads to more natural and less repetitive surface realisation. It also allows generation from partial and modified inputs and is therefore applicable to incremental surface realisation.

The current work suggested using a driver fatigue detection system using transfer learning, depending only on one EEG channel to increase system usability. The system firstly acquires the signal and passing it through preprocessing filtering then, converts it to a 2D spectrogram. Finally, the 2D spectrogram is classified with AlexNet using transfer learning to classify it either normal or fatigue state. The current study compares the accuracy of seven EEG channel to select one of them as the most accurate channel to depend on it for classification. The results show that the channels FP1 and T3 are the most effective channels to indicate the drive fatigue state. They achieved an accuracy of 90% and 91% respectively.

Thus they are able to estimate interactions even in problems with huge sparsity (like recommender systems) where SVMs fail. We show that the model equation of FMs can be calculated in linear time and thus FMs can be optimized directly. So unlike nonlinear SVMs, a transformation in the dual form is not necessary and the model parameters can be estimated directly without the need of any support vector in the solution. We show the relationship to SVMs and the advantages of FMs for parameter estimation in sparse settings. On the other hand there are many different factorization models like matrix factorization, parallel factor analysis or specialized models like SVD++, PITF or FPMC. The drawback of these models is that they are not applicable for general prediction tasks but work only with special input data. Furthermore their model equations and optimization algorithms are derived individually for each task.

We call the new neural network: Self-Growing and Self-Organized Neural Gas (SGONG). Its main advantage is that it defines the number of the created neurons and their topology in an automatic way. Besides, a new method is proposed for the Estimation of the Most Important of already created Classes (EMIC). The combination of SGONG and EMIC in color images results in retaining the isolated and significant colors with the minimum number of color classes. The above techniques are able to be fed by both color and spatial features. For this reason a similarity function is used for vector comparison.

Within Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), this approach fails to distinguish between the efficiencies of hypothesised programs, such as quick sort (O(n log n)) and bubble sort (O(n2)). This paper addresses this issue by considering techniques to minimise both the textual complexity and resource complexity of hypothesised robot strategies. We develop a general framework for the problem of minimising resource complexity and show that on two robot strategy problems, 1) Postman 2) Sorter (recursively sort letters for delivery), the theoretical resource complexities of optimal strategies vary depending on whether objects can be composed within a strategy. The approach considered is an extension of Meta-Interpretive Learning (MIL), a recently developed paradigm in ILP which supports predicate invention and the learning of recursive logic programs. We introduce a new MIL implementation, MetagolO, and prove its convergence, with increasing numbers of randomly chosen examples to optimal strategies of this kind. Our experiments show that MetagolO learns theoretically optimal robot sorting strategies, which is in agreement with the theoretical predictions showing a clear divergence in resource requirements as the number of objects grows.

Using this new regularizer allows us to adapt the large-scale WSABIE procedure and to leverage the Adam stochastic optimization algorithm, which results in an algorithm that scales gracefully to very large data-sets. Also, we derive a kernelized version which allows to take advantage of state-of-the-art features for re-identification when data-set size permits kernel computation. Benchmarks on recent and standard re-identification data-sets show that our method beats existing state-of-the-art techniques both in terms of accuracy and speed.

While previous efforts address the problem by designing novel self-supervised tasks using video data, the learned features are merely on a frame-by-frame basis, which are not applicable to many video analytic tasks where spatio-temporal features are prevailing. In this paper we propose a novel self-supervised approach to learn spatio-temporal features for video representation. Inspired by the success of two-stream approaches in video classification, we propose to learn visual features by regressing both motion and appearance statistics along spatial and temporal dimensions, given only the input video data. Specifically, we extract statistical concepts (fast-motion region and the corresponding dominant direction, spatio-temporal color diversity, dominant color, etc.) from simple patterns in both spatial and temporal domains. Unlike prior puzzles that are even hard for humans to solve, the proposed approach is consistent with human inherent visual habits and therefore easy to answer. We conduct extensive experiments with C3D to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The experiments show that our approach can significantly improve the performance of C3D when applied to video classification tasks.

In this paper, we introduce a novel feature extraction technique, namely Sum of Relevant Inter-Cell Values (SRIV) using which we propose a passive (blind) image forgery detection method based on Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP). First, the input image is divided into non-overlapping blocks and 2D block DCT is applied to capture the changes of a tampered image in the frequency domain. Then LBP operator is applied to enhance the local changes among the neighbouring DCT coefficients, magnifying the changes in high frequency components resulting from splicing and copy-move attacks. The resulting LBP image is again divided into non-overlapping blocks. Finally, SRIV is applied on the LBP image blocks to extract features which are then fed into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to identify forged images from authentic ones.

However, the identification of features of brain activity containing sufficient information to decode, or \u201cbrain-read\u201d, unattended (implicit) fear perception remains an active research goal. Here we test the hypothesis that patterns of large-scale functional connectivity (FC) decode the emotional expression of implicitly perceived faces within single individuals using training data from separate subjects. fMRI and a blocked design were used to acquire BOLD signals during implicit (task-unrelated) presentation of fearful and neutral faces. A pattern classifier (linear kernel Support Vector Machine, or SVM) with linear filter feature selection used pair-wise FC as features to predict the emotional expression of implicitly presented faces. We plotted classification accuracy vs. number of top N selected features and observed that significantly higher than chance accuracies (between 90\u2013100%) were achieved with 15\u201340 features. During fearful face presentation, the most informative and positively modulated FC was between angular gyrus and hippocampus, while the greatest overall contributing region was the thalamus, with positively modulated connections to bilateral middle temporal gyrus and insula. Other FCs that predicted fear included superior-occipital and parietal regions, cerebellum and prefrontal cortex. By comparison, patterns of spatial activity (as opposed to interactivity) were relatively uninformative in decoding implicit fear. These findings indicate that whole-brain patterns of interactivity are a sensitive and informative signature of unattended fearful emotion processing. At the same time, we demonstrate and propose a sensitive and exploratory approach for the identification of large-scale, condition-dependent FC.

In this paper, we compare the performances of two downscaling statistical methods for reconstructing and forecasting wind speed at a specific location from the European Center of Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model outputs. The assessment of ECMWF shows for 10 m wind speed displays a systematic bias, while at 100 m, the wind speed is better represented.

Although researchers have given increasing efforts on cloud detection, the performance is still unsatisfactory due to the diverse nature of clouds. Considering the fact that one source of information (color or texture) is not enough to segment cloud from clear sky, in this letter, we propose a novel ground-based cloud detection method using graph model (GM) built upon superpixels to integrate multiple sources of information. First, we use the superpixel segmentation to divide the image into a series of subregions according to the color similarity and spatial continuity. Next, adjacent superpixels are merged according to their similarity of extracted features. Finally, we build a GM on the merged superpixels by considering each superpixel as a node and adding edges between neighboring ones. The unary cost is set according to the classification score of Random Forests, while pairwise cost reflects the penalties for color and texture discontinuity between neighboring components. The final segmentation could be acquired by minimizing the cost function. Moreover, the algorithm is computationally efficient as we use the superpixels rather than raw pixels as computation units.

The remaining input variables, i.e., hole diameter, hole depth, burden-to-spacing ratio, stemming, and powder factor, were utilized to develop the probabilistic prediction model using the Bayesian network (BN) technique. The learning and structure type of the BN model were maximum likelihood and tree augmented naive Bayes, respectively. Many perfect probabilities were observed in the BN model for flyrock occurrence. The hole diameters between 97.5 and 127.5 mm appeared in four perfect probability conditions, which show that this hole diameter range is the most influential parameter.

The planet host HATS-19 is a slightly evolved V = 13.0 G0 star with [Fe/H] = 0.240, a mass of 1.303 Msun, and a radius of 1.75 Rsun. HATS-19b is in an eccentric orbit (e = 0.30) around this star with an orbital period of 4.5697 days and has a mass of 0.427 Mjup and a highly inflated radius of 1.66 Rjup. The planet HATS-20b has a Saturn-like mass and radius of 0.273 Mjup and 0.776 Rjup respectively. It orbits the V = 13.8 G9V star HATS-20 (Ms = 0.910 Msun; Rs = 0.892 Rsun) with a period of 3.7993 days.

We find a significant positive correlation between planet equilibrium temperature and radius, and a weak negative correlation between host metallicity and radius. To assess the relative influence of various physical parameters on observed planet radii, we train and fit models using Random Forest regression. We find that for hot-Saturns (0.1<Mp<0.5 Mjup), the planetary mass and equilibrium temperature play dominant roles in determining radii. For hot-Jupiters (0.5<Mp<2.0 Mjup), the most important parameter is equilibrium temperature alone.

Methods: IMRT plans from 102 prostate cases were randomly divided into two datasets for training and testing, respectively. The testing dataset contains a fixed number of 20 cases, while the number of cases in the training dataset varied from 5 to 80. Models were constructed with SVM, ANN, or MR to formulate the dependence of the OAR DVH on patient anatomical features including the Distance to Target Histogram (DTH), PTV and OAR volumes and their overlap, among other volumetric or spatial information. The D50 (Dose value at 50% volume) and the mean square of difference between D50 of clinical and predicted DVH were calculated for each modeling technique at each specific training dataset number. Results: The mean square of difference of D50 between clinical and predicted DVH decreases with the number of cases in the training dataset, and reaches stable beyond 30 for MR. With the 80 case training dataset, for the bladder model, the SVM predicted 70% D50 values within 10% error and the ANN predicted 85%, compared to 85% with multiple regression. For the rectum model, the numbers are SVM 80%, ANN 70%, and MR 85%.

However, non-standardized imaging pro-tocols are commonplace, which poses a fundamental challenge in large-scale cross-center CT image analysis. One approach to address the problem is to standardize CT images using generative adversarial network models (GAN). GAN learns the data distribution of training images and generate synthesized images under the same distribution. However, existing GAN models are not directly applicable to this task mainly due to the lack of constraints on the mode of data to generate. Furthermore, they treat every image equally, but in real applications, some images are more difficult to standardize than the others. All these may lead to the lack-of-detail problem in CT image synthesis. We present a new GAN model called GANai to mitigate the differences in radiomic features across CT images captured using non-standard imaging protocols. Given source images, GANai composes new images by specifying a high-level goal that the image features of the synthesized images should be similar to those of the standard images. GANai introduces an alternative improvement training strategy to alternatively and steadily improve model performance. The new training strategy enables a series of technical improvements, including phase-specific loss functions, phase-specific training data, and the adoption of ensemble learning, leading to better model performance. The experimental results show that GANai is significantly better than the existing state-of-the-art image synthesis algorithms on CT image standardization. Also, it significantly improves the efficiency and stability of GAN model training.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1101/460188", "venue": null, "journal": "bioRxiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2899496165", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["118047194", "135939765", "120507709", "3679118", "12256959", "3725129", "207569482", "20638476", "28771334", "6278208", "1563370", "3448668", "206395074", "60845912", "54119578", "1033682", "12803511", "6200260", "34517595", "23354926", "205128181", "21456555", "24258698", "3767412", "11758569", "15876696", "8239952", "206770979", "4025915", "16991836", "7208970", "16367617", "3719281", "8469530", "120349231", "3068944", "6287870", "1282515", "1687220", "121530032", "44988345", "10894094", "11252052"], "inbound_citations": ["211060194"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:91815725"}

This is the first analytical result on the behavior of dynamics for non-consensus problems on non-complete topologies, based on the first symmetry-breaking analysis in such setting. ::: In the context of the study of Label Propagation Algorithms, a class of widely used heuristics for clustering in data mining, it represents the first theoretical result on the behavior of a label propagation algorithm with quasilinear message complexity. In the context of evolutionary biology, dynamics such as the Moran process have been used to model the spread of mutations in genetic populations. Our results shows that, when the probability of adoption of a given mutation by a node of the evolutionary graph depends super-linearly on the frequency of the mutation in the neighborhood of the node, and the underlying evolutionary graph has a clustered structure, there is a non-negligible probability for \\emph{species differentiation} to occur. Finally, in the context of neuroscience, evolutionary graph dynamics have been used to model the innervation of synapses on muscular junctions during development. Our result, corroborated by numerical simulations on a wider class of dynamics, provide evidence that, in order for the model to comply with experimental evidence on the outcome of the innervation process, either the innervation sites do not exhibit spatial bottlenecks or the dynamics cannot be based on majority-like mechanism.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1805.01406", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2962970375,2798615518,2949511691", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["5769057", "9134861", "10166847", "11114816", "4899461", "33388193", "15962979", "14983050", "14381478", "85886258", "31061266", "4667695", "3122193", "117613165", "11640250", "25685919", "1689835", "8496987", "14632320", "43157048", "62236257", "6584122", "4986002", "12695631", "14779474", "1814524", "9432644", "44044132", "196660652", "45160373", "17634856", "7448251", "4804952", "10309230", "116669381", "144839904", "18436272", "7824258", "9653963", "2656238", "7853898", "8941218", "34098453", "120893346", "44191227", "15648916", "4386820", "117930922", "2381954", "118522282", "21168889", "13948536", "38562161", "19372422", "18741059", "867216", "16613146", "15031152", "10430339", "202230983", "16630414", "15073403", "7847060", "15039047", "11234742", "10186582", "1913517", "11912497"], "inbound_citations": ["54025847"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:19151155"}

When it comes to real time situations, the system degrades sharply in handling variations like illumination, occlusions, skin tone, cosmetics, image misalignment, age, pose, etc., inherent in the face images acquired. Hence understanding and eliminating the effects of each of these factors is crucial to any face recognition system. This paper deals with studying the effect of variances in the Eye Blink Strengths (EBS) on a face image undergoing face recognition, thereby testing the efficiency of face recognition algorithm. The study makes exclusive usage of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) technology to detect eye blinks and to measure their corresponding EBS values using Electroencephalograph (EEG) device. The face recognition algorithm under test was the amalgamation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Local Binary Pattern (LBP) based feature extraction and Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classification. EBS is assessed using an inexpensive, portable, non-invasive EEG device. The efficiency of the face recognition algorithm to withstand the eye blinks with varying degree of EBS values for the given face images was determined. It was found that the proposed methodology of test case generation can be effectively be used to evaluate various other face recognition algorithms against varying eye blinks.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IADCC.2015.7154733", "venue": "2015 IEEE International Advance Computing Conference (IACC)", "journal": "2015 IEEE International Advance Computing Conference (IACC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1581223203", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14057321", "38057416", "3917747", "133493936", "14531655", "32320564", "12001434", "15673757", "207107744", "37498143", "16604874"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14137538"}

This algorithm tends to produce good generalization ability and obtain least experience risk simultaneously with solid foundations.

Binary codes are well suited to large-scale applications as they are storage efficient and permit exact sub-linear kNN search. The framework is applicable to broad families of mappings, and uses a flexible form of triplet ranking loss. We overcome discontinuous optimization of the discrete mappings by minimizing a piecewise-smooth upper bound on empirical loss, inspired by latent structural SVMs. We develop a new loss-augmented inference algorithm that is quadratic in the code length. We show strong retrieval performance on CIFAR-10 and MNIST, with promising classification results using no more than kNN on the binary codes.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "NIPS", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2113307832", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["284030", "4229473", "43462652", "85843", "15260993", "3198903", "1555909", "52800221", "120070226", "39299286", "1658773", "6110572", "5850884", "18268744", "7201154", "357776", "7317448", "2003696", "6324963", "62245742", "1501682", "2051403", "6488984", "14503028", "15301", "47325215", "2643381", "10240161"], "inbound_citations": ["8294874", "2519230", "7074126", "16321038", "14014121", "14312497", "25579442", "4387615", "53379736", "600183", "4334034", "45856425", "14152305", "20548479", "2591068", "9852724", "212628603", "19195787", "5840040", "214604176", "78094295", "92376", "53086279", "4942272", "18390071", "14355364", "22132831", "18414248", "203605964", "28687191", "184488046", "90228032", "7321858", "1926900", "10016509", "158599", "7953396", "1307328", "84845879", "50772474", "17267967", "1596835", "1216501", "15824960", "203140550", "911406", "2962975", "13367125", "22816849", "59932646", "211532745", "61809478", "148571558", "46857537", "46857537", "49560314", "14286736", "18908084", "50775019", "3648870", "12565094", "11590678", "14811827", "27396984", "7458496", "211506084", "22293624", "3331287", "49190708", "58576522", "199377548", "210930919", "52163920", "10123377", "14490133", "13639480", "22688627", "46893947", "11468788", "10187311", "51941594", "38666695", "2176941", "212628504", "57572936", "606989", "7531692", "4651269", "10960724", "5706227", "999039", "2996597", "3693305", "2464327", "18058643", "16699011", "10680224", "64532223", "206870972", "202135945", "19469387", "53757775", "13995550", "7277809", "1136006", "211107043", "6917776", "14000804", "208179229", "52948589", "21628403", "7908490", "11194874", "9275142", "7839088", "15252199", "7335676", "3976597", "847507", "10632321", "198181815", "54445825", "40761001", "148572660", "54197581", "11381533", "18602343", "215721747", "54998979", "214799401", "2494742", "10333238", "211252812", "9479291", "15968370", "51824673", "6055846", "989746", "182732476", "5263344", "210866345", "53035938", "27706449", "52218114", "16843297", "212630527", "44063523", "19479761", "211298128", "14297859", "204802550", "210180947", "52295428", "28115900", "5671282", "207917844", "37401240", "70102084", "6664126", "2344371", "206726841", "213192708", "211211886", "80628084", "17737009", "12979032", "201285237", "3561074", "2780963", "11307479", "196193751", "139101932", "28063279", "73536527", "52146591", "7449120", "49574066", "21687302", "14656843", "209459346", "5564100", "13936751", "195492182", "1449366", "67855907", "52943611", "17228784", "865622", "53289253", "7189592", "53622838", "204907061", "51681009", "3730207", "52927841", "5876779", "27008712", "1039794", "4922166", "213190904", "59599692", "34595675", "7570553", "1402726", "115604151", "6544802", "14205981", "3990899", "73729416", "1010081", "53037837", "8225900", "6305490", "53228551", "16119713", "51614720", "4274849", "167204382", "67830672", "9103537", "53963987", "49396330", "2329179", "4910762", "58822507", "34287714", "199000713", "8003870", "28497119", "127461149", "174801158", "209393382", "53873581", "207217044", "57765652", "8024458", "1285363", "59232192", "4714242", "115206096", "7353171", "7312769", "2433132", "206769089", "51921050", "9691998", "9757556", "2702836"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8180104"}

Previous work has shown that explicit rhetorical structure markers, such as paragraph delimiters, titles and subtitles, sentence boundaries, fonts and styles, are essential in helping the reader understand text documents. However, such structural clues are absent in spoken documents. Summaries where salient utterances are extracted from an entire spoken document and grouped together have shown to be difficult to understand. This challenge also gives rise to the difficulty of compiling gold standard reference summaries. On the other hand, it is evident from presentation slides and meeting minutes that humans, when summarizing the content of a talk or a meeting, use explicit rhetorical labels such as titles, subtitles, bullet points, paragraph and page breaks. We suggest that a good extractive summary should be clearly structured like presentation slides or meeting minutes, with explicit structural markers. ::: We show that such type of rhetorical structure is rendered by both acoustic and linguistic features in spoken documents. We present Principal Component Analysis (PCA) graphs derived from such features, showing clear self-clustering of speech utterances according to the underlying rhetorical state \u2014 for example acoustic and linguistic feature vectors from the \u201cintroduction\u201d, \u201cmethodology\u201d, \u201cconclusion\u201d of a conference presentation speech; or the \u201cbill\u201d, \u201cquestion and answer\u201d or \u201cmotion\u201d of a parliamentary speech, or the business items of a meeting minute are grouped together. ::: We then propose different machine learning methods to model these rhetorical states for a structural-based summarization approach. Extracted salient utterances are grouped under the labels of each rhetorical state, in a hierarchical fashion, emulating presentation slides, or meeting minutes, to yield summaries that are more easily understandable by humans. We investigate how to automatically model the inherent rhetorical structure of presentation speech and parliamentary speech. We show one approach of using Rhetorical State Hidden Markov Models (RSHMM) with segmental summarization and another approach of Hidden Markov Support Vector Machine (HMSVM) classifiers to generate structured extractive summaries from presentation speech. We further investigate how to combine rhetorical structure modeling with summarization process into one step for improving summarization performance. Finally we show an approach of using a single Conditional Random Field (CRF) classifier, to perform both rhetorical structure modeling and extractive summarization in one step, by chunking, parsing and extraction of salient utterances, to generate meeting minutes from parliamentary speech. ::: One important challenge to reliable extractive summarization is the lack of agreement between humans on gold standard summaries. However, humans agree more on what a correct flow of a summary should be when given explicit structural labels. We show empirical results where human annotators obtain higher inter-labeler agreement on drafting gold standard summaries, when they are guided by these automatically extracted rhetorical labels. We further find that applying active learning approach for training our summarizer with a given accuracy can help us reduce human annotation efforts evidently. We also show that higher quality extractive summaries are obtained under our proposed framework.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.14711/thesis-b1155523", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2585341253", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["21144408"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:63465755"}

As the measurement samples may come endlessly, there is a practical need to adjust the dimension of OS-ELM not only by adding hidden units but also by pruning superfluous units simultaneously. To evaluate the contribution of existing hidden units and locate the superfluous units, an index is implemented referred to as normalized error reduction ratio.

Therefore, selecting a method or a technique that is capable of providing the highest landslide prediction capability is highly important. The main objective of this study is to assess and compare the prediction capability of advanced machine learning methods for landslide susceptibility mapping in the Mila Basin (Algeria). First, a geospatial database was constructed from various sources. The database contains 1156 landslide polygons and 16 conditioning factors (altitude, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index (TWI), landforms, rainfall, lithology, stratigraphy, soil type, soil texture, landuse, depth to bedrock, bulk density, distance to faults, distance to hydrographic network, and distance to road networks). Subsequently, the database was randomly resampled into training sets and validation sets using 5 times repeated 10 k-folds cross-validations. Using the training and validation sets, five landslide susceptibility models were constructed, assessed, and compared using Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Logistic Regression (LR), Artificial Neural Network (NNET), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The prediction capability of the five landslide models was assessed and compared using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the area under the ROC curves (AUC), overall accuracy (Acc), and kappa index. Additionally, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were performed to confirm statistical significance in the differences among the five machine learning models employed in this study. The result showed that the GBM model has the highest prediction capability (AUC = 0.8967), followed by the RF model (AUC = 0.8957), the NNET model (AUC = 0.8882), the SVM model (AUC = 0.8818), and the LR model (AUC = 0.8575). Therefore, we concluded that GBM and RF are the most suitable for this study area and should be used to produce landslide susceptibility maps. These maps as a technical framework are used to develop countermeasures and regulatory policies to minimize landslide damages in the Mila Basin.

In order to deal with high dimensionality, low sample size, imbalanced classes, Random Forests (RF) have been widely adopted in this field. RF consists in building a classifier ensemble, with randomization to produce a diverse pool of tree-based classifiers. Since their introduction in 2001 by Leo Breiman, RF have been extensively studied, both theoretically and experimentally, and have shown competitive performance with state of the art classifiers. However, only a few studies have addressed the issues raised by the choice of the hyper-parameters and their influence on RF performance. This talk will first address our attempts to better understand and explain the performance of RF through their hyper-parameters that have led us to propose different variants of RF, namely Forest-RK and Dynamic Random Forests, to be less sensitive to the choice, sometimes critical on the generalization performance, of the parametrization. In a second part I will illustrate the use of RF on two medical applications: the classification of endomicroscopic images of the lungs and cancer stage/patient prediction with Radiomics, a domain which is increasingly attracting attention. When dealing with medical data, it might happen that only data of one class (eg healthy patient) is available for training. This is typically the case for endomicroscopic images of the lungs and we have proposed an original approach to deal with outliers in medical image classification, namely One Class Random Forests, which has shown to be effective for our problem and competitive with other state of the art one class classifiers. The second application of RF is Radiomics, a new (2012) concept which refers to the analysis of large amount of quantitative tumor features, extracted from multimodal medical images and other information like clinical data and gene or protein data to predict the patient's evolution and/or survival rate. In this case, data are both highly dimensional and heterogeneous. As part of an on going work, we have proposed a dissimilarity-based multi-view learning model with random forest, in which each data view (or group of features) is processed separately so that the data dimension is smaller in each view. By combining different views together, we can take advantage of the heterogeneity between views while avoiding using conventional feature selection methods for reducing the high dimensionality of data.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICSIPA.2017.8120567", "venue": "ICSIPA", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2773708562", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:34414152"}

The major drawbacks of these tests are subjective colour evaluation depending on the operator ('50 shades of blue') and a lack of selectivity. An alternative fast screening technique is Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectrometry. This technique provides spectra that are difficult to interpret without specialized expertise and shows a lack of sensitivity for the detection of cocaine in mixtures. To overcome these limitations, a portable FTIR spectrometer using Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) sampling was combined with a multivariate technique, called Support Vector Machines (SVM). Representative street drug powders (n = 482), seized during the period January 2013 to July 2015, and reference powders (n = 33) were used to build and validate a classification model (n = 515) and a quantification model (n = 378). Both models were compared with the conventional chromatographic techniques. The SVM classification model showed a high sensitivity, specificity, and efficiency (99%). The SVM quantification model determined cocaine content with a root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) of 6% calculated over a wide working range from 4 to 99 w%. In conclusion, the developed models resulted in a clear output (cocaine detected or cocaine not detected) and a reliable estimation of the cocaine content in a wide variety of mixtures. The ATR-FTIR technique combined with SVM is a straightforward, user-friendly, and fast approach for routine classification and quantification of cocaine in seized powders.

One way of achieving it is to modify the message so that it is readable only by the receiver, as in cryptography for example. Hiding the message in an innocuous medium is another, called steganography. And the counterpart to steganography, that is, discovering whether a message is hidden in a specific medium, is called steganalysis. Other concerns also fall within the broad scope of the term steganalysis, such as estimating the message length for example (which is quantitative steganalysis). In this dissertation, the emphasis is put on classical steganalysis of images first -- the mere detection of a modified image -- for which a practical benchmark is proposed: the evaluation of a sufficient amount of samples to perform the steganalysis in a statistically significant manner, followed by feature selection for dimensionality reduction and interpretability. The fact that most of the features used in the classical steganalysis task have a physical meaning, regarding the image, lends itself to an introspection and analysis of the selected features for understanding the functioning and weaknesses of steganographic schemes. This approach is computationally demanding, both because of the feature selection and the size of the data in steganalysis problems. To address this issue, a fast and efficient machine learning model is proposed, the Optimally-Pruned Extreme Learning Machine (OP-ELM). It uses random projections in the framework of an Artificial Neural Network (precisely, a Single Layer Feedforward Network) along with a neuron selection strategy, to obtain robustness regarding irrelevant features, and achieves state of the art performances. The OP-ELM is also used in a novel approach at quantitative steganalysis (message length estimation). The re-embedding concept is proposed, which embeds a new known message in a suspicious image. By repeating this operation multiple times for varying sizes of the newly embedded message, it is possible to estimate the original message size used by the sender, along with a confidence interval on this value. An intrinsic property of the image, the inner difficulty, is also revealed thanks to the confidence interval width; this gives an important information about the reliability of the estimation on the original message size.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2511469298", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["3999361"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:41520748"}

Multi-robot teams working cooperatively to perform multiple tasks simultaneously have the potential to be more robust to failure and efficient when compared to single robot solutions.

Current decentralized collaboration approaches, such as auction-based methods, degrade in poor communication environments. Sensor information regarding teammates can be leveraged to perform behavior recognition and task-assignment in the absence of communication. This work illustrates the use of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to perform behavior recognition as an approach to task monitoring in the absence of robust communication in a challenging underwater environment.

The accurate classification of the images is used to perform on-line material identification in industrial environments. Each hyperspectral image consists of the diffuse reflectance of the material under study along all the points of a line of vision. These images are measured through the employment of two imaging spectrographs operating at Vis-NIR, from 400 to 1000 nm, and NIR, from 1000 to 2400 nm, ranges of the spectrum, respectively. The aim of this work is to demonstrate the robustness of Support Vector Machines to recognise certain spectral features of the target. Furthermore, research has been made to find the adequate SVM configuration for this hyperspectral application. In this way, anomaly detection and material identification can be efficiently performed. A classifier with a combination of a Gaussian Kernel and a non linear Principal Component Analysis, namely k-PCA is concluded as the best option in this particular case.

It can learn the structure of data set independently and adjust the structure spontaneously through the \u201cdata shunt\u201d, which can improve the efficiency of model, simplify the complexity of model and optimize the indicators to achieve the goal of reducing bank operating costs and bad debt rates.(1) Supervised data splitter: In this paper, we select the density-based outlier test algorithm Local Outlier Factor (LOF) as the main algorithm of the shunt and the raw data will be reduced and clustered by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means++ clustering algorithm, and the outlier test pipeline will be constructed for each cluster data. Finally, the samples identified as abnormal in each cluster will be sent to the \u201cstrict channel\u201d to simplify the whole model, speed up the calculation and improve the recall rate and other indicators, whereas the samples identified as normal will be sent to the \u201cloose channel\u201d to speed up the approval of loans to normal customers.(2) Construction of the two-channel model: It has been verified that the \u201cstrict channel\u201d has the best performance when using the Bagging model as the main model based on eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and the \u201cloose channel\u201d has the best performance when using the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) single model. In general, the empirical results show that the dual-channel credit evaluation model with shunt could achieve the effect of simplifying the whole model, speeding up the calculation, and optimizing the model indicators.

To remove redundant information out from our cyclopean, the sparse representation is applied to extract essential features.

Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA), and Comparative Molecular Similarities Indices Analysis (CoMSIA) models were generated using a training set of EGFR ligands of known inhibitory activities. The top four TCM candidates based on DockScore were 2-O-caffeoyl tartaric acid, Emitine, Rosmaricine, and 2-Oferuloyl tartaric acid, and all had higher binding affinities than the control IressaH. The TCM candidates had interactions with Asp855, Lys716, and Lys728, all which are residues of the protein kinase binding site. Validated MLR (r 2 = 0.7858) and SVM (r 2 = 0.8754) models predicted good bioactivity for the TCM candidates.

A facial expression that contains thousands of information as an artistic painting can be described in thousands of words. Followed by the idea, there has recently been a number of attempts to provide customers and companies with an intelligent service, which enables the perception of human emotions through one's facial expressions. For example, MIT Media Lab, the leading organization in this research area, has developed the human emotion prediction model, and has applied their studies to the commercial business. In the academic area, a number of the conventional methods such as Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) or Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been applied to predict human emotion in prior studies. However, MRA is generally criticized because of its low prediction accuracy. This is inevitable since MRA can only explain the linear relationship between the dependent variables and the independent variable. To mitigate the limitations of MRA, some studies like Jung and Kim (2012) have used ANN as the alternative, and they reported that ANN generated more accurate prediction than the statistical methods like MRA. However, it has also been criticized due to over fitting and the difficulty of the network design (e.g. setting the number of the layers and the number of the nodes in the hidden layers). Under this background, we propose a novel model using Support Vector Regression (SVR) in order to increase the prediction accuracy. SVR is an extensive version of Support Vector Machine (SVM) designated to solve the regression problems. The model produced by SVR only depends on a subset of the training data, because the cost function for building the model ignores any training data that is close (within a threshold ) to the model prediction. Using SVR, we tried to build a model that can measure the level of arousal and valence from the facial features. To validate the usefulness of the proposed model, we collected the data of facial reactions when providing appropriate visual stimulating contents, and extracted the features from the data. Next, the steps of the preprocessing were taken to choose statistically significant variables. In total, 297 cases were used for the experiment. As the comparative models, we also applied MRA and ANN to the same data set. For SVR, we adopted '-insensitive loss function', and 'grid search' technique to find the optimal values of the parameters like C, d, , and . In the case of ANN, we adopted a standard three-layer backpropagation network, which has a single hidden layer. The learning rate and momentum rate of ANN were set to 10%, and we used sigmoid function as the transfer function of hidden and output nodes. We performed the experiments repeatedly by varying the number of nodes in the hidden layer to n/2, n, 3n/2, and 2n, where n is the number of the input variables. The stopping condition for ANN was set to 50,000 learning events. And, we used MAE (Mean Absolute Error) as the measure for performance comparison. From the experiment, we found that SVR achieved the highest prediction accuracy for the hold-out data set compared to MRA and ANN. Regardless of the target variables (the level of arousal, or the level of positive / negative valence), SVR showed the best performance for the hold-out data set. ANN also outperformed MRA, however, it showed the considerably lower prediction accuracy than SVR for both target variables. The findings of our research are expected to be useful to the researchers or practitioners who are willing to build the models for recognizing human emotions.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.13088/jiis.2012.18.3.185", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "323421235", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["211005243"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:142483355"}

In modern industry systems, collected sample signals are usually not equally distributed, meaning the quantity of data from different working conditions are barely the same. Researchers have proposed a number of methods tackling the issue, most of which try to extract the features of the original data to unify them. Basic and valid algorithm is distribution adaption which include transfer component analysis (TCA), joint distribution adaptation (JDA), correlation alignment (CORAL) and other varieties. These methods have shown great effectiveness in practice. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are newly developed generative models which can generate new sample data similar to original data through a special designed competitive training procedure. While distribution adaption unify the signal under all the conditions, GAN models are able to achieve approximate distribution functions and generate fake samples for different working conditions. In this paper, a new fault diagnosis transfer learning approach is proposed with a cycle-consistent GAN model. The designed GAN tries to generate new sample for unknown conditions based on known conditions and makes it possible to pre-train a classifier for fault diagnosis.

In spite of being trained using images with entirely different domain, these networks are flexible to adapt to solve a problem in a different domain too. Transfer learning involves fine-tuning a pre-trained network with optimal values of hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of training epochs. The process of training the network identifies the relevant features for solving a specific problem. Adapting the pre-trained network to solve a different problem requires fine-tuning until relevant features are obtained. This is facilitated through the use of large number of filters present in the convolutional layers of pre-trained network. A very few features out of these features are useful for solving the problem in a different domain, while others are irrelevant, use of which may only reduce the efficacy of the network. However, by minimizing the number of filters required to solve the problem, the efficiency of the training the network can be improved. In this study, we consider identification of relevant filters using the pre-trained networks namely AlexNet and VGG-16 net to detect cervical cancer from cervix images.

Detecting or predicting failures and estimating machine health in this way assumes that future field data will have a very similar distribution to the experiment data. However, many complex machines operate under dynamic environmental conditions and are used in many different ways. This makes collecting comprehensive data very challenging, and the assumption that pre-deployment data and post-deployment data follow very similar distributions is unlikely to hold. ::: Transfer Learning (TL) refers to methods for transferring knowledge learned in one setting (the source domain) to another setting (the target domain). In this work we present a TL method for predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of equipment, under the assumption that labels are available only for the source domain and not the target domain. This setting corresponds to generalizing from a limited number of run-to-failure experiments performed prior to deployment into making prognostics with data coming from deployed equipment that is being used under multiple new operating conditions and experiencing previously unseen faults. We employ a deviation detection method, Consensus Self-Organizing Models (COSMO), to create transferable features for building the RUL regression model. These features capture how different target equipment is in comparison to its peers. ::: The efficiency of the proposed TL method is demonstrated using the NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set.

Secondly, the training sample sets of each category are clustered by k-means clustering algorithm, and all cluster centers are taken as the new training samples.

National statistics indicate that most higher education institutions have four-year degree completion rates around 50%, or just half of their student populations. While there are prediction models which illuminate what factors assist with college student success, interventions that support course selections on a semester-to-semester basis have yet to be deeply understood. To further this goal, we develop a system to predict students\u2019 grades in the courses they will enroll in during the next enrollment term by learning patterns from historical transcript data coupled with additional information about students, courses and the instructors teaching them. We explore a variety of classic and state-of-the-art techniques which have proven effective for recommendation tasks in the e-commerce domain. In our experiments, Factorization Machines (FM), Random Forests (RF), and the Personalized Multi-Linear Regression model achieve the lowest prediction error. Application of a novel feature selection technique is key to the predictive success and interpretability of the FM. By comparing feature importance across populations and across models, we uncover strong connections between instructor characteristics and student performance.

To detect protein structural classes from protein primary sequence information, homology-based methods have been developed, which can be divided to three types: discriminative classifiers, generative models for protein families and pairwise sequence comparisons. Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Neural Networks (NN) are two popular discriminative methods. Recent studies have shown that SVM has fast speed during training, more accurate and efficient compared to NN. We present a comprehensive method based on two-layer classifiers. The 1st layer is used to detect up to superfamily and family in SCOP hierarchy using optimized binary SVM classification rules. It used the kernel function known as the Bio-kernel, which incorporates the biological information in the classification process. The 2nd layer uses discriminative SVM algorithm with string kernel that will detect up to protein fold level in SCOP hierarchy. The results obtained were evaluated using mean ROC and mean MRFP and the significance of the result produced with pairwise t-test was tested. Experimental results show that our approaches significantly improve the performance of remote protein homology detection and fold recognition for all three different version SCOP datasets (1.53, 1.67 and 1.73).

For prosodic features, a set of features that are closely correlated with speech emotional states are selected. In the proposed hybrid emotion recognition system, due to the inherently different characteristics of these two kinds of features (e.g., data size), the newly extracted spectral features are modeled by Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and the selected prosodic features are modeled by Support Vector Machine (SVM).

One of the challenges in segmenting such multi-modal trajectories is that demonstrations vary spatially, temporally, and contain random noise and loops (repetition until achieving the desired result). Segments of task trajectories are often less complex, less variable, and allow for easier detection of outliers. As manual segmentation can be tedious and error-prone, we propose a new segmentation method that combines hybrid dynamical systems theory and Bayesian non-parametric statistics to automatically segment demonstrations. Transition State Clustering (TSC) models demonstrations as noisy realizations of a switched linear dynamical system, and learns spatially and temporally consistent transition events across demonstrations. TSC uses a hierarchical Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model to avoid having to select the number of segments a priori. After a series of merging and pruning steps, the algorithm adaptively optimizes the number of segments. In a synthetic case study with two linear dynamical regimes, where demonstrations are corrupted with noise and temporal variations, TSC finds up to a 20% more accurate segmentation than GMM-based alternatives. On 67 recordings of surgical needle passing and suturing tasks from the JIGSAWS surgical training dataset [7], supplemented with manually annotated visual features, TSC finds 83% of needle passing segments and 73% of the suturing segments found by human experts.

We use the term Action Unit (AU) to describe a movement of one or more muscles of the face and all expressions can be described using the AU's described by FACS. ::: ::: The shape model is calculated by marking the face with 122 landmark points. We use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to analyse how the landmark points move with respect to each other and to lower the dimensionality of the problem. Using the FESM in conjunction with Support Vector Machines (SVM) we classify facial expressions. SVMs are a powerful machine learning technique based on optimisation theory. ::: ::: This project is largely concerned with statistical models, machine learning techniques and psychological tools used in the classification of facial expression. This holistic approach to expression classification provides a means for a level of interaction with a computer that is a significant step forward in human-computer interaction.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.605074", "venue": "SPIE OPTO-Ireland", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1995067707", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["22727274", "142736456", "61105478", "16859093", "39344060", "39236394", "41400240", "1530384", "39216344", "7905699", "15052186", "5857309", "206849277", "41312633", "64543020", "143728236", "147511389", "35845206", "193073128", "7171226", "15464588", "59692956"], "inbound_citations": ["58936449", "10605948"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62689731"}

Some of them suffer from severe hearing loss and consequently use an alternative manner with which to communicate with society by means of either written or visual language. There are several sign languages capable of dealing with such a need. Nonetheless, a communication gap still exists even when using such languages, since only a small fraction of the population is able to use them. Over the last few years, due to the increasing need for universal accessibility when using computational resources, gesture recognition has been widely researched. Thus, in an attempt to reduce this communication gap, our approach proposes a computational solution in order to translate static gesture symbols into text symbols, through computer vision, without the use of hand sensors or gloves. In order to guarantee the highest quality, with emphasis on the reliability of the system and real-time translation, we have developed an approach based on the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) pattern recognition algorithms fully implemented in hardware, and have assessed it to measure these two metrics. Hardware components were designed in order to perform the best image processing and pattern recognition tasks used within the project. As a case study, and so as to validate the technique, a recognition system for the Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS) was implemented. Besides ensuring that this approach could be used for any static hand gesture symbol recognition, our main goal was to guarantee fast, reliable gesture recognition for communication between humans.

The proposed work introduces an FER system, which models the relationship between human facial expression and corresponding induced emotion for static images by extracting shape and appearance features. Automatic interpretation of facial expressions from static images is very challenging, as information available in a static image is less when compared with image sequences. Proposed method incites efficient extraction of shape and appearance features from still images for varying facial expressions using Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) features, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed for classification. The proposed work is implemented on Cohn-kanade data set for six basic expressions (happy, sad, surprise, anger, fear and disgust).

Some methods discretize numerical attributes while learning decision rules. We compare the classification accuracy of a discretization method based on conditional entropy, applied before rule induction, with two newly proposed methods, incorporated directly into the rule induction algorithm LEM2, where discretization and rule induction are performed at the same time. In all three approaches the same system is used for classification of new, unseen data.

Parameters associated with nitrogen cycling were also critical factors, with positive effects on microbial diversity, while S-related parameters had negative effects. The microbial community analysis also indicated that the microbial assemblage was driven by pH. Various taxa were enriched in different pH ranges: Sulfobacillus was the indicator genus in samples with pH < 3 while Acidobacteriaceae-affiliated bacteria prevailed in samples with 3 < pH < 3.5. The detection of some lineages that are seldom reported in mining areas suggested the coal mining dumps may be a reservoir of phylogenetic novelty. For example, potential nitrogen fixers, autotrophs, and heterotrophs may form diverse communities that actively self-perpetuate pyrite dissolution and acidic waste generation, suggesting unique ecological strategies adopted by these innate microorganisms. In addition, co-occurrence network analyses suggest that members of Acidimicrobiales play important roles in interactions with other taxa, especially Fe- and S-oxidizing bacteria such as Sulfobacillus spp.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30854582", "doi": "10.1007/s00248-019-01335-5", "venue": "Microbial Ecology", "journal": "Microbial Ecology", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2921495404", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["89607993", "3653032", "25959173", "110242386", "30053911", "24245069", "44339747", "98423014", "766794", "98035894", "21441084", "42049238", "19137044", "37813976", "12190492", "45980484", "205129689", "52924486", "55797742", "15996046", "16923281", "7491504", "54735661", "3558092", "29533056", "41237007", "23727280", "7526445", "8644300", "10211877", "215527455", "36527232", "41196801", "34826735", "4818659", "53044661", "59582551", "22652650", "12875432", "14658072", "127680799", "46551394", "8995554", "96079859", "1183702", "94834475", "97509827", "137105723", "36075", "54760842", "102265702", "53044661", "38324740", "93718016", "39697115", "6889638", "128758974", "11631720", "206731310", "10054836", "31272186", "3141836", "22099510", "18187666", "73640445", "264492", "13904", "37405055"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:72940983"}

Classification is one of the widely used techniques in the machine learning. It is a mechanism of grouping the data according to the predefined class labels. The popular classification algorithms are K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm (K- NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. K-NN is a lazy learning method where classification is done by comparing the feature vectors of different points. K-NN is popular due to its simplicity and efficiency, but complexity is in finding the k value as a small k value will result in obtaining lesser information from training data. Support Vector Machine is another algorithm where an optimal hyperplane is chosen for classifying the diabetes dataset. SVM provides high accuracy and found to be popular in high dimensional data space. The hybrid classification algorithm is used to build the classification model using SVM-NN classifier is proposed. In this proposed SVM-NN classifier the impact of k parameter is reduced by considering only support vectors in order to classify the data. In SVM-NN Manhattan distance measure is used to compute the distance between the test samples and support vectors. The test samples can be compared to the class labels of the original class labels and performance can be evaluated using the confusion matrix. This proposed SVM-NN algorithm can reduce the size of the training samples and also greatly reduces the classifying time, so it can be used for large data sets.

In such problems if the constraint cannot be satisfied, then a rejection option is introduced. For binary labelled classification, a number of SVM based methods with rejection option have been proposed over the past few years. All of these methods use two thresholds on the SVM output. However, in previous works, we have shown on synthetic data that using thresholds on the output of the optimal SVM may lead to poor results for classification tasks with performance constraint. In this paper a new method for supervised classification with rejection option is proposed. It consists in two different classifiers jointly optimized to minimize the rejection probability subject to a given constraint on error rate. This method uses a new kernel based linear learning machine that we have recently presented. This learning machine is characterized by its simplicity and high training speed which makes the simultaneous optimization of the two classifiers computationally reasonable.

Many researchers are studying passive sensing of stress using wrist-worn sensors; however, this effort focuses on understanding the essential features of wrist-worn sensors in detecting stress, and how to best induce stress in a lab setting. Applying machine learning methods increasingly is making it feasible to validly infer in real time through passive sensing of physical features psychological states, such as stress. Given strong participant adherence to wrist-worn sensors, this paper focuses on analyzing the effect of replacing other body sensing platforms (e.g. chest-based heart rate) with their wrist-worn equivalent on stress prediction accuracy. Nine participants were equipped with multiple body sensors and were asked to wear a commercially available Android smartwatch, a custom-designed smartwatch equipped with a Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensor, a chest-based heart rate sensor, and a finger-based commercial GSR sensor. Based on participant self-reports, singing experiment showed greatest stress levels across participants.

For instance, when regularization networks are used, complexity scales as the cube of the overall number of training data, which may be large when several tasks are involved. The aim of this paper is to derive an efficient computational scheme for an important class of multitask kernels.

The main objective of our study is to expand an automatic expert system (ES) to provide an accurate diagnosis of BC. Both, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were applied to analyze BC data. The well-known Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD), available in the UCI repository, was examined in our study. We first tested the SVM algorithm using various values of the C, \u025b and \u03b3 parameters. As a result of the first experiment, we were able to observe that the adjustment of these regularization parameters can greatly improve the performance of the traditional SVM algorithm applied for BC detection. The highest obtained accuracy at the first step was 99.71%. Then, we performed a new BC detection approach based on two ensemble learning techniques: the confidence-weighted voting method and the boosting ensemble technique. Our model, called CWV-BANNSVM, combines boosting ANNs (BANN) and two SVMs, using optimal parameters selected during the first experiment. The performance of the applied methods was evaluated using several popular metrics, such as specificity, sensitivity, precision, FPR, FNR, F1 score, AUC, Gini and accuracy. The proposed CWV-BANNSVM model was able to improve the performance of the traditional machine learning algorithms applied to BC detection, reaching the accuracy of 100%. To overcome the overfitting issue, we determined and used some appropriate parameter values of polynomial SVM. Our comparison with the existing studies dedicated to BC prediction suggests that the proposed CWV-BANN-SVM model provides one of the best prediction performances overall.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.measurement.2019.05.022", "venue": null, "journal": "Measurement", "mag_id": "2944939776", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["209312155", "211247156", "214692770"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:182205435"}

The effectiveness of a variety of basic word formation features, syntactic features, and semantic features are exploited and compared for the three sequence labeling methods.

In contrast to estimating diversity via inputs, outputs, or classifier parameters, we propose a diversity measurement based on whether the ensemble members agree on the probability of a regional distribution change. In our method, estimations over regional distribution changes are used as instance weights. Constructing different region sets through different schemes will lead to different drift estimation results, thereby creating diversity. The classifiers that disagree the most are selected to maximize diversity.

Information on system software, such as embedded software, operating systems, and firmware, are overlooked, unless reviews of a product using them are investigated.

Motivated by these observations, we conduct an exploratory study using a dataset of 7198 review sentences from 6 Internet of Things (IoT) products. Our qualitative analysis demonstrates that a sufficient quantity of software related information exists in these reviews.

Traditional SAR image ATR methods based on template matching need constructing a large number of targets' SAR image templates, and calculating the distance between the input SAR image and templates. However, the application of template matching methods is limited since no enough template images are generated resulting from the lack of the directly acquired SAR image data and the unguaranteed data quality. Although deep learning technology has made great progress in generating visible light images, it is also difficult to generate quantities of SAR images with high quality due to limited data acquisition means and complex imaging mechanism. More compact representation of the latent structure in the electromagnetic scattering data will be needed to fulfill the image quality and quantity requirements.In this paper, based on the deep learning technology, we propose a method to generate SAR image template of targets from multiple angles using the generative depth neural network.We use Bayesian network to construct a generative adversarial network (GAN), in which the parameters of the generative model and recognition model are pre-trained with general data sets to obtain a GAN model with the ability to generate SAR images from different azimuth angles. Then SAR images with different azimuth angles at the same elevation angle are used as samples. The model is re-trained to capture SAR images' features. Experiments show that this method can generate SAR images in new azimuth angles by using a small amount of data from other azimuth angles at the same elevation angle. This method can generate a larger dataset with a mount of high quality SAR image data for different targets, which can be used for template matching in multiple azimuth angles, as well as for other in-depth ATR study.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/PIERS-Fall48861.2019.9021403", "venue": "2019 Photonics & Electromagnetics Research Symposium - Fall (PIERS - Fall)", "journal": "2019 Photonics & Electromagnetics Research Symposium - Fall (PIERS - Fall)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3011618775", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["23450643", "6145058", "4004450", "8292571", "208022507", "114338640", "4747025"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212647373"}

This work presents a method to adjust SVM parameters before classification, and examines overlapped segmentation and majority voting as two techniques to improve controller performance. A SVM, as the core of classification in myoelectric control, is compared with two commonly used classifiers: linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks. It demonstrates exceptional accuracy, robust performance, and low computational load. The entropy of the output of the classifier is also examined as an online index to evaluate the correctness of classification; this can be used by online training for long-term myoelectric control operations.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "18632358", "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2008.919734", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2134408600", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["108801971", "32104730", "20719385", "11837702", "25308802", "41659190", "21581170", "6019912", "989105", "61995597", "57324502", "9693267", "6749381", "60475546", "10084310", "59746419", "7486888", "961425", "60488836", "15874442", "7664224", "8830643", "52874011", "53362521", "21869062", "60908578"], "inbound_citations": ["211211543", "214875264", "21728571", "14480909", "19100388", "199509213", "11303615", "18431837", "26790400", "5164956", "49597413", "57468236", "210931864", "18908532", "15443284", "53100672", "202541397", "61936595", "12984104", "118799726", "55269694", "208630073", "7370231", "23665675", "58008370", "14765259", "16736570", "199058335", "23871434", "51870358", "52915763", "37811080", "21071763", "210693684", "210888646", "18643067", "4980105", "16232513", "1930382", "20977548", "18242266", "34204357", "21819434", "976637", "29946527", "8689065", "12476392", "52151487", "4532368", "174800997", "14000057", "211524054", "67857899", "25062632", "24177064", "33103035", "20912851", "8970167", "27337721", "4708257", "119596", "51906506", "2619362", "22601347", "13667002", "29166054", "52911150", "21500049", "19170399", "15102576", "7710242", "51613172", "25601094", "18276814", "14448865", "30017765", "6545398", "206760040", "17042282", "206611860", "17576779", "40652188", "4946297", "20612037", "3648998", "174820256", "42340425", "57373887", "62255", "51618217", "14710785", "14830572", "55168848", "24223746", "198906012", "18277956", "211207570", "2114", "53579641", "214700216", "2936490", "116799962", "16511612", "17814127", "16271513", "53101278", "18361824", "35472646", "214887308", "204801011", "8654404", "215134062", "13939909", "6765259", "53116437", "1725567", "10313688", "215024933", "208881410", "52068952", "48952417", "16293406", "7499255", "1763424", "86848072", "41384514", "31849429", "51872193", "204232102", "209462596", "4403105", "59313878", "116434933", "56679281", "116442556", "1298096", "67404291", "2875748", "202715603", "9992207", "9282488", "146119458", "32217456", "3204126", "4090690", "117743509", "17519032", "14459248", "132355872", "3050701", "23339395", "14840242", "59620491", "36138556", "19556929", "11726711", "202560329", "3681836", "14835695", "7810371", "195508965", "11941981", "116145277", "53093424", "3553418", "17056756", "32837690", "17899296", "14977105", "22471966", "51984445", "1969544", "17668728", "73443305", "4953171", "4562026", "17464686", "3094408", "341617", "16857106", "55515798", "202102366", "214861561", "210720890", "34668212", "14452670", "3176403", "16899921", "204818720", "17325121", "61268878", "15953456", "59553676", "17726342", "14148705", "135276782", "20297483", "18750586", "16583466", "13278073", "212702630", "2781803", "6485223", "116160202", "2080253", "3708184", "52212060", "7878280", "208631836", "215378121", "15807396", "28733441", "46955118", "13405817", "8645723", "39640269", "14883575", "2535901", "1879455", "607907", "51613319", "51920503", "14248532", "26426470", "208526924", "15001708", "13141246", "52113588", "14917022", "236314", "35344190", "108615740", "11964499", "215149344", "9224069", "16400515", "3746783", "29608123", "1165518", "7496971", "5787483", "26408204", "59708", "15458142", "10006963", "197431243", "69479239", "13806037", "1598812", "54142177", "276841", "23674549", "8805293", "27695941", "14451301", "206634246", "55838610", "3040774", "53718170", "21409116", "58008104", "206625934", "30224276", "149988309", "140341747", "71152453", "210878780", "14117914", "59320202", "16591890", "1119203", "3896592", "6692496", "19992664", "8142115", "52902868", "19479278", "24589322", "199441636", "18875123", "9238589", "38752652", "198117712", "24180821", "14544457", "199406814", "202687444", "41089217", "9262688", "2518244", "195764368", "30758883", "4798603", "12157226", "3110607", "210971770", "14592190", "85524942", "45935919", "6568317", "102354633", "18052862", "23800572", "18578084", "25255512", "81337599"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17162934"}

Interest in using soil VNIR spectral libraries, which are commonly based on dry ground soils, to predict soils in the intact field-moist condition (in situ VNIR) is growing. External parameter orthogonalization (EPO) has been proposed as a useful method that links dry ground VNIR models to field moist scans. The goal of this study is to test EPO on a wider set of soil properties and four different modeling techniques, namely, Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We selected and scanned 352 archived soil samples from Nebraska, USA, among which 185 samples were used to develop dry ground models and the remaining 167 samples were rewetted to eight different moisture levels for EPO development and testing. Two methods to determine optimum number of EPO components, model-coupled cross validation (Model-Coupled-CV) and Wilk's \u039b were also compared. The results showed that EPO minimized the variability of soil spectra induced by moisture. Results suggest a preference for the Wilk's \u039b method over Model-Coupled-CV for determining the number of EPO components g, as it produced smoother transformed spectra and more parsimonious models. Among the eight soil properties tested, EPO caused significant improvements for soil Organic Carbon (OC), Inorganic Carbon (IC), and Total Carbon (TC) prediction, marginal improvement for sand and clay, and no improvement for pH, Mehlich-3 Phosphorus, and Cation Exchange Capacity. The failed EPO for the latter three properties is attributable to the poor initial dry-ground models that EPO was built upon. For OC, IC, and TC, EPO coupled effectively with all four modeling methods, with ANN and SVM outperforming the other two slightly. This adds flexibility to the implementation of EPO in predicting field moist soils. As there are increasing demands of spatially-explicit soil data in many disciplines, EPO would be an important essential part for the future in situ VNIR based proximal soil sensing technology.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.geoderma.2015.12.014", "venue": null, "journal": "Geoderma", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2225651437", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["128092536", "98713790", "129456372", "108830608", "32922094", "8298929", "110554648", "128992341", "128758014", "62973643", "94209846", "39468772", "209092086", "3093707", "128884882", "131401438", "128474055", "98484355", "128754905", "128700502", "53460059", "55896316", "140162977", "53382380", "53367939", "53054400", "214750992", "98363377", "129020369", "129291978"], "inbound_citations": ["4773098", "54849488", "203120996", "133142877", "201636989", "4791746", "132572608", "51632735", "55488085", "54709003", "134956029", "103676157", "35082225", "62834667", "170075314"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49382947"}

Gaussian Processes (GP), based on Bayesian inference, provide the most objective estimation of the uncertainty of the predictions, thus permitting the evaluation of the applicability domain (AD) of the model. Furthermore, the experimental error on bioactivity measurements can be used as input for this probabilistic model. In this study, we apply GP implemented with a panel of kernels on three various (and multispecies) PCM datasets. The first dataset consisted of information from 8 human and rat adenosine receptors with 10,999 small molecule ligands and their binding affinity. The second consisted of the catalytic activity of four dengue virus NS3 proteases on 56 small peptides. Finally, we have gathered bioactivity information of small molecule ligands on 91 aminergic GPCRs from 9 different species, leading to a dataset of 24,593 datapoints with a matrix completeness of only 2.43%. GP models trained on these datasets are statistically sound, at the same level of statistical significance as Support Vector Machines (SVM), with [Formula: see text] values on the external dataset ranging from 0.68 to 0.92, and RMSEP values close to the experimental error. Furthermore, the best GP models obtained with the normalized polynomial and radial kernels provide intervals of confidence for the predictions in agreement with the cumulative Gaussian distribution. GP models were also interpreted on the basis of individual targets and of ligand descriptors. In the dengue dataset, the model interpretation in terms of the amino-acid positions in the tetra-peptide ligands gave biologically meaningful results.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4083135", "pubmed_id": "25045403", "doi": "10.1186/1758-2946-6-35", "venue": "Journal of Cheminformatics", "journal": "Journal of Cheminformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2144377773", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["40004630", "82729647", "976090", "2158516", "94390419", "42005324", "767946", "43575926", "7845512", "9271583", "22030511", "44969235", "1715506", "1684827", "20027090", "2805703", "5132461", "14316571", "35213560", "34732867", "34419831", "7918725", "97769153", "19612945", "12041898", "4712104", "5983205", "12651050", "205493859", "25241144", "1093192", "21801193", "16681789", "207237870", "39931737", "30264445", "5477536", "13279646", "195652429", "16552240", "2990825", "117238981", "122759122", "60809283", "11921023", "60488129", "207164343", "20369058", "37247932", "3963223", "15491620", "1348587", "26639627", "26040189", "2433860", "11836963", "1733955", "205014975", "5999634", "16789217", "7341531", "15422844", "8581477", "930666", "9152610", "5042289", "677811"], "inbound_citations": ["3962217", "215160406", "15083141", "530112", "199543475", "677811", "4894646", "38380829", "210976118", "198234002", "214918742", "3866300", "4037502", "18476999", "24941478", "119285364", "8994564", "215138913"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:677811"}

An automatic classification of four beat types Normal (N), premature ventricular contraction (PVC), Supraventricular premature or ectopic beat (SVPB) and Fusion of ventricular and normal beat (FUSION) is implemented using a Multi-class Support Vector Machine (MSVM) and Complex Support Vector Machine (CSVM) algorithms [1]. The ECG signals used in these studies were obtained from the European ST-T Database. A number of beats from different leads and patients were selected for training and evaluating classifier performance. Successful ECG arrhythmia classification usually requires optimizing the following procedures: Pre-processing and beat detection, feature extraction and selection, and classifier optimization. Pre-processing and R peak detection is performed with the WFDB Software Package. This reads the annotation and finds the R (peak) location. R (peak) location used as a reference to detect peaks in other wave such P and T and extract ECG beat. ECG beats are extracted after windowing the signal using 106 samples before the R and 106 samples after the R-peak. Discrete Cosine and Sine transforms or the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) were used for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction of the input vector at the input of the classifier. Studies after selecting either 100 or 50 Fourier coefficients for reconstructing individual ECG beats in the feature selection phase were performed. MATLAB software routines were used to train and validate both the CSVM and the Multi-class Support Vector Machine (MSVM) classifier. A Complex kernel function, (Gaussian RBK) with 5-fold cross validation was used for adjusting the kernel values. Sequential minimal optimization (SMO) [2] was used to train the CSVM and compute the corresponding complex hyper-plane parameters. The aim of the study was to improve multi-class SVM by extending traditional SVM algorithms to complex spaces so as to simultaneously classify four types of heartbeats. Results illustrate that the proposed beat classifier is very reliable, and that it may be adopted for automatic detection of arrhythmia conditions and classification. Accuracies between 86% and 94% are obtained for MSVM and CSVM classification respectively. Using CSVM, a 4 classes problem can be classified rapidly by decomposing it into two distinct SVM tasks. Moreover, the present research confirmed that the use of selected number of Fourier coefficients to approximate the ECG beat signal and compress the input features to the classifier can lead to high classification accuracies and improve the generalization ability of the CSVM classifier.

In this study, a novel UAC algorithm exploiting the deep CNNs based feature transfer learning and the deep belief net (DBN) based classification is developed. The spectrogram is first adopted for the urban acoustic stream representation. Then, three deep CNNs pre-trained on ImageNet database are applied as feature extractors. The extracted features are concatenated and fed to a DBN for classifier learning. To achieve a good generalization performance, three restricted boltzmann machines (RBM) trained by the contrastive divergence algorithm (CD) followed by a back-propagation (BP) based fine parameter tuning is adopted in DBN. The proposed UAC is evaluated on a real acoustic database, including 11 categories of acoustic signals recorded from the urban environment.

Recently, several predictive process monitoring methods based on deep learning such as Long Short-Term Memory or Convolutional Neural Network have been proposed to address the problem of next event prediction. However, due to insufficient training data or sub-optimal network configuration and architecture, these approaches do not generalize well the problem at hand. This paper proposes a novel adversarial training framework to address this shortcoming, based on an adaptation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to the realm of sequential temporal data. The training works by putting one neural network against the other in a two-player game (hence the adversarial nature) which leads to predictions that are indistinguishable from the ground truth. We formally show that the worst-case accuracy of the proposed approach is at least equal to the accuracy achieved in non-adversarial settings. From the experimental evaluation it emerges that the approach systematically outperforms all baselines both in terms of accuracy and earliness of the prediction, despite using a simple network architecture and a naive feature encoding.

The Super Learner algorithm is an ensemble method that has been theoretically proven to represent an asymptotically optimal system for learning. The Super Learner, also known as stacking, combines multiple, typically diverse, base learning algorithms into a single, powerful prediction function through a secondary learning process called metalearning. Although ensemble methods offer superior performance over their singleton counterparts, there is an implicit computational cost to ensembles, as it requires training multiple base learning algorithms. We present several practical solutions to reducing the computational burden of ensemble learning while retaining superior model performance, along with software, code examples and benchmarks. Further, we present a generalized metalearning method for approximating the combination of the base learners which maximizes a model performance metric of interest. As an example, we create an AUC-maximizing Super Learner and show that this technique works especially well in the case of imbalanced binary outcomes. We conclude by presenting a computationally efficient approach to approximating variance for cross-validated AUC estimates using influence functions. This technique can be used generally to obtain confidence intervals for any estimator, however, due to the extensive use of AUC in the field of biostatistics, cross-validated AUC is used as a practical, motivating example.The goal of this body of work is to provide new scalable approaches to obtaining the highest performing predictive models while optimizing any model performance metric of interest, and further, to provide computationally efficient inference for that estimate.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2216192020", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["86698004", "4741207", "53041716", "196691188"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17419688"}

Several data processing and data evaluation steps are required to come to the final results. These operations are often difficult to reproduce, because of too specific computing platforms. This effect, known as \u2018workflow decay\u2019, can be diminished by using a standardized informatic infrastructure. Thus, we compiled an integrated platform, which contains ready-to-use tools and workflows for mass spectrometry data analysis. Apart from general unit operations, such as peak picking and identification of proteins and metabolites, we put a strong emphasis on the statistical validation of results and Data Mining. MASSyPup64 includes e.g., the OpenMS/TOPPAS framework, the Trans-Proteomic-Pipeline programs, the ProteoWizard tools, X!Tandem, Comet and SpiderMass. The statistical computing language R is installed with packages for MS data analyses, such as XCMS/metaXCMS and MetabR. The R package Rattle provides a user-friendly access to multiple Data Mining methods. Further, we added the non-conventional spreadsheet program teapot for editing large data sets and a command line tool for transposing large matrices. Individual programs, console commands and modules can be integrated using the Workflow Management System (WMS) taverna. We explain the useful combination of the tools by practical examples: (1) A workflow for protein identification and validation, with subsequent Association Analysis of peptides, (2) Cluster analysis and Data Mining in targeted Metabolomics, and (3) Raw data processing, Data Mining and identification of metabolites in untargeted Metabolomics. Association Analyses reveal relationships between variables across different sample sets. We present its application for finding co-occurring peptides, which can be used for target proteomics, the discovery of alternative biomarkers and protein\u2013protein interactions. Data Mining derived models displayed a higher robustness and accuracy for classifying sample groups in targeted Metabolomics than cluster analyses. Random Forest models do not only provide predictive models, which can be deployed for new data sets, but also the variable importance. We demonstrate that the later is especially useful for tracking down significant signals and affected pathways in untargeted Metabolomics. Thus, Random Forest modeling supports the unbiased search for relevant biological features in Metabolomics. Our results clearly manifest the importance of Data Mining methods to disclose non-obvious information in biological mass spectrometry . The application of a Workflow Management System and the integration of all required programs and data in a consistent platform makes the presented data analyses strategies reproducible for non-expert users.

The goal of such methods is repeatable, refutable (and possibly improvable) results in software engineering. Many of the recent papers in SE literature are based on data from on-line repositories such as http://promisedata.googlecode.com. This introduces a kind of selection in the kinds of papers published at this venue. Our first paper pushes past that bias to explore a very rich time-based data set. In \u201cPredicting the Flow of Defect Correction Effort using a Bayesian Network Model\u201d, Schulz et al. use a Bayes net to explore the effects of removing defects at different stages of the software lifecycle. Their work shows how to calibrate general models to the particulars of a company\u2019s local particulars. Our next paper \u201cThe Limited Impact of Individual Developer Data on Software Defect Prediction\u201d by Bell et concludes there is no added value to reasoning on some aspects of social aspects of programmer teams working on a code. This is a timely counterpoint to other research that eschews code measures for other approaches based only on social metrics. Our last paper explores the complicated issue of parameter tuning. In \u201cUsing Tabu Search to Configure Support Vector Regression for Effort Estimation\u201d, Corazza et al. offers automated guidance for setting the parameters that control a learner. This is a matter of critical importance since even the best learner can perform poorly if its operator uses the wrong settings. A special issue like this is only possible due to the hard work of a dedicated set of authors are reviewers. We would like to express our gratitude to all authors who submitted their papers this special issue. We would also like to thank our reviewers for their meticulous evaluation of the submissions.

In order to efficiently address the problem, this work first decomposes the aging process into multiple short-term stages. Then, a novel generative probabilistic model, named Temporal Non-Volume Preserving (TNVP) transformation, is presented to model the facial aging process at each stage. Unlike Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which requires an empirical balance threshold, and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM), an intractable model, our proposed TNVP approach guarantees a tractable density function, exact inference and evaluation for embedding the feature transformations between faces in consecutive stages. Our model shows its advantages not only in capturing the non-linear age related variance in each stage but also producing a smooth synthesis in age progression across faces. Our approach can model any face in the wild provided with only four basic landmark points. Moreover, the structure can be transformed into a deep convolutional network while keeping the advantages of probabilistic models with tractable log-likelihood density estimation. Our method is evaluated in both terms of synthesizing age-progressed faces and cross-age face verification and consistently shows the state-of-the-art results in various face aging databases, i.e. FG-NET, MORPH, AginG Faces in the Wild (AGFW), and Cross-Age Celebrity Dataset (CACD).

In order to obtain good performance for scene representation, a proper model for feature extraction and large amounts of labeled training samples are required. However, in real-world applications, it usually cannot provide enough labeled samples since labeling is always time-consuming. To overcome this problem, this work develops a novel unsupervised deep feature learning framework with iteratively refined pseudo-classes for remote sensing scene representation. First, we introduce the center points to construct the pseudo-classes and assign the pseudo labels to the training samples. Then, a pseudo-center loss is developed by decreasing the intra-class variance between the learned features of the samples and the corresponding center points to iteratively refine the pseudo classes with the training samples in the training process. Moreover, to increase the inter-class variance between different pseudo classes and further improve the performance of the unsupervised learning, this work imposes the diversity-promoting priors over the center points. Finally, the unsupervised learning framework is developed by joint learning of the diversified pseudo-center loss and pseudo-class-based softmax loss where the pseudo-class-based softmax loss is to update the convolutional neural network (CNN) with the pseudo-classes and the diversified pseudo-center loss is to iteratively refine the pseudo-classes with the features learned from the CNN.

C. Cheng, which is a remarkable rare relict plant, has gradually been reduced to its current narrow range due to climate change. Understanding the comprehensive distribution of M. glyptostroboides under climate change on a large spatio-temporal scale is of great significance for determining its forest adaptation. In this study, based on 394 occurrence data and 10 bioclimatic variables, the global potential distribution of M. glyptostroboides under eight different climate scenarios (i.e., the past three, the current one, and the next four) from the Quaternary glacial to the future was simulated by a random forest model built with the biomod2 package. The key bioclimatic variables affecting the distribution of M. glyptostroboides are BIO2 (mean diurnal range), BIO1 (annual mean temperature), BIO9 (mean temperature of driest quarter), BIO6 (min temperature of coldest month), and BIO18 (precipitation of warmest quarter). The result indicates that the temperature affects the potential distribution of M. glyptostroboides more than the precipitation. A visualization of the results revealed that the current relatively suitable habitats of M. glyptostroboides are mainly distributed in East Asia and Western Europe, with a total area of approximately 6.857 \u00d7 106 km2. With the intensification of global warming in the future, the potential distribution and the suitability of M. glyptostroboides have a relatively non-pessimistic trend. Whether under the mild (RCP4.5) and higher (RCP8.5) emission scenarios, the total area of suitable habitats will be wider than it is now by the 2070s, and the habitat suitability will increase to varying degrees within a wide spatial range. After speculating on the potential distribution of M. glyptostroboides in the past, the glacial refugia of M. glyptostroboides were inferred, and projections regarding the future conditions of these places are expected to be optimistic. In order to better protect the species, the locations of its priority protected areas and key protected areas, mainly in Western Europe and East Asia, were further identified. Our results will provide theoretical reference for the long-term management of M. glyptostroboides, and can be used as background information for the restoration of other endangered species in the future.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/f11010062", "venue": null, "journal": "Forests", "mag_id": "2996880391", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213142159"}

As a popular image processing technique, spectral mixture analysis (SMA) has rarely been applied to coarse-resolution imagery due to the difficulty of deriving endmember spectra using traditional endmember selection methods, particularly within heterogeneous urban environments. To address this problem, we derived endmember signatures through a least squares solution (LSS) technique with known abundances of sample pixels, and integrated these endmember signatures into SMA for mapping large-scale impervious surface fraction. In addition, with the same sample set, we carried out objective comparative analyses among SMA (i.e. fully constrained and unconstrained SMA) and machine learning (i.e. Cubist regression tree and Random Forests) techniques. Analysis of results suggests three major conclusions. First, with the extrapolated endmember spectra from stratified random training samples, the SMA approaches performed relatively well, as indicated by small MAE values.

It has gained much importance in the recent years because of its real-time applications in object tracking, medical imaging, image organizations for large datasets, image and video retrieval. For instance, in image retrieval, query image once classified to the correct category avoids the searching of similar images from the complete dataset. In the state of art approaches, the classification techniques are generally discussed for a single dataset having similar images such as Textures(Rock,trees, texture based images), Describable Texture dataset (clothing pattern), Oxford Dataset(building pattern), etc. Thus a common approach for classification of various types of images is lacking. This paper presents a common approach for the variety of datasets having different types of images. Four different types of dataset, Caltech-101(101 different categories of images eg. airplane, sunflower, bike, etc), ORL Face, Bangla Signature and Hindi Signature are used for testing the proposed classification approach. The proposed approach has three phases. Region of Interest(ROI) using SURF(Speed Up Robust Transform) Points is obtained in the first phase. Extraction of LBP(Local Binary Pattern) Features on ROI is done in the second phase. In the third phase clustering of LBP features are done with a new proposed approach as CFC(Clustering with Fixed Centers) to construct Bag of LBP Features. Through proposed CFC approach each image is annotated/tagged with a fixed Bag of Features to avoid the training of machine, again and again. SVM is used here for classification as it has been experimentally found to give the best performance when compared with Decision Tree, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbor and Linear Method. The accuracy obtained for Caltech-101, ORL Face, and Signature(Bangla and Hindi) are 79.0%, 75.0%, 81.6% and 87.0% respectively.

To leverage the benefits of jointly learning from multiple related tasks and making active queries, we propose a novel active multitask learning approach based on trace norm regularized least squares. The basic idea is to induce an optimal classifier which has the lowest risk and at the same time which is closest to the true hypothesis. Toward this aim, we devise a new active selection criterion that takes into account not only the risk but also the excess risk, which measures the distance to the true hypothesis. Based on this criterion, our proposed algorithm actively selects the instance to query for its label based on the combination of the two risks.

The basics of machine learning is to build algorithms that can take input data and use statistical analysis to predict an output value within an acceptable range.

Existing protocols are optimized for a specific scenario, and are not capable of working in various scenarios. Therefore, designing an intelligent protocol which can tune itself in relation to the change of network environment is particularly important. In this paper, we propose a broadcast protocol which is able to make forwarding decision based on a self-learning mechanism. The protocol employs a fuzzy logic-based relay node selection approach to take into account multiple metrics for the forwarding algorithm. The parameters used for the fuzzy logic are tuned online using a reinforcement learning approach. Transfer learning is used to transfer knowledge to new arriving vehicles (agents) in order to shorten the convergence time. The combination of reinforcement learning, transfer learning and fuzzy logic can provide an intelligent solution for broadcasting in VANETs.

The identification result will be the benchmark to choose the basis of assessment. The identification process of cognitive ability can be done by giving questions in certain difficulties levels. The appropriateness of difficulty levels can be made based on bloom taxonomy introduced by Benjamin Bloom in 1956 and revised by Lorin Anderson Krathwohl in 1994. There are 6 levels in bloom taxonomy, namely remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating and creating. However, the questions classification process based on bloom taxonomy is not easy when it is done manually. Classification process needs long time if there are many questions items. Besides, the different perception in classification make manual classification process is varied from one to another. This research suggests a method that produces automation classification of Indonesian language question items based on new bloom taxonomy levels.

While ideal for domains like bioinformatics with many challenging datasets, many ensemble methods, such as Bagging and Boosting, do not take into account the high-dimensionality (large number of features per instance) that is commonly found in bioinformatics datasets. This work seeks to observe the effects of two relatively new ensemble learning methods (Select-Bagging and Select-Boosting: the Bagging and Boosting approaches with feature selection implemented within each iteration of their algorithms) on a series of seven balanced (greater than a 43.50% minority class distribution) bioinformatics datasets. Additionally, we included the results when no ensemble approach is implemented (denoted as No-Ensemble) so that we can observe the full effects of ensemble learning. In order to test the three approaches we use three feature rankers, four feature subset sizes, and two classifiers. The results show that Select-Bagging is the top performing ensemble approach and statistical analysis confirms that Select-Bagging is significantly better than No-Ensemble and better (though not significantly) than Select-Boosting.

Our study aimed to improve the phenotypic characterization of overweight but apparently healthy subjects and to identify new candidate profiles for early biomarkers of obesity-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Methodology/Principal Findings - In a population of 56 healthy, middle-aged overweight subjects Body Mass Index (BMI), fasting concentration of 124 plasma proteins and insulin were determined. The plasma proteins are implicated in chronic diseases, inflammation, endothelial function and metabolic signaling. Random Forest was applied to select proteins associated with BMI and plasma insulin. Subsequently, the selected proteins were analyzed by clustering methods to identify protein clusters associated with BMI and plasma insulin. Similar analyses were performed for a second population of 20 healthy, overweight older subjects to verify associations found in population I. In both populations similar clusters of proteins associated with BMI or insulin were identified. Leptin and a number of pro-inflammatory proteins, previously identified as possible biomarkers for obesity-related disease, e.g. Complement 3, C Reactive Protein, Serum Amyloid P, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor clustered together and were positively associated with BMI and insulin. IL-3 and IL-13 clustered together with Apolipoprotein A1 and were inversely associated with BMI and might be potential new biomarkers. Conclusion/ Significance - We identified clusters of plasma proteins associated with BMI and insulin in healthy populations. These clusters included previously reported biomarkers for obesity-related disease and potential new biomarkers such as IL-3 and IL-13.

Our method is based on the framework of single-stage object detection. The core of our proposed solution is mining memory neurons in original model, then the rest neurons are updated and employed to detect new class. This strategy ensure minimal drop in performance of original classes. We conduct extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset, along with a detailed empirical analysis of our approach, and achieve much better performance against catastrophic forgetting than prior incremental object detectors.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CompComm.2018.8780739", "venue": "2018 IEEE 4th International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC)", "journal": "2018 IEEE 4th International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2964638774", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["206597351", "1241368", "206770307", "10328909", "206594738", "2141740", "47259365", "1358160", "914027", "14124313", "827792", "2238772", "2134321", "35249701", "207252270", "13740328", "207224096"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199440787"}

Recent study yielded reasonable prediction accuracy of 56.0% on an independent set of 27 most populated folds. In this communication, we apply the support vector machine (SVM) method, using a combination of protein descriptors based on the properties derived from the composition of n-peptide and jury voting, to the fine-grained fold prediction, and are able to achieve an overall prediction accuracy of 69.6% on thesameindependentset\u2014significantlyhigherthan the previous results.

The ball bearing is a key component of the rotary axis of machine tool, and its functionality is to bear the external load on the axis as well as maintain the center position of the axis. A damaged bearing will result in abnormal vibration and noise, and thus will lead to the damage of the machine and produced workpieces. Therefore, inspection and identification of ball bearing failures is particularly important. This paper discusses the fault signals of ball bearings published by the Society for Machinery Failure Prevention Technology (MFPT) and creates a recognition model for the ball bearing state based on different fault states, and then we adopt two different approaches for feature extraction. The first approach implements Finite Impulse Response Filter (FIR) and Approximate Entropy (ApEn) to extract the signal features. The second approach utilizes the Chen-Lee chaotic system for analysis and takes its chaotic attractor as the feature of the state recognition. The comparison of model recognition accuracy for Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) was conducted after acquiring the features through the two approaches in this paper. The results of the experiments in this paper show that both of the feature extraction approaches enable the state to be recognized easily. The Chen-Lee chaotic system with BPNN not only reaches 100% identification rate and it has the highest overall efficiency; it takes only 0.054 second to complete the feature extraction for 63 sets of data; this study is able to provide timely and precise solution for the failure of key mechanical components.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2971554", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3005876912", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["24762190", "54452566", "115676971", "109579616", "197524084", "15390406", "125921541", "21091443", "42322984", "49350535", "31240566", "206531613", "115199410", "40335843", "110324290", "54202632", "25728869", "61633018", "52198070", "214872171", "202770710", "27070044", "2727597", "61811152", "174817832", "15234027", "49406215", "1433046", "181899800", "67774098", "6453601", "110952346", "94936887", "25884633", "67874981", "195697331", "11821068", "113005367", "123034868", "106605524", "126972212"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211209481"}

The performance of each method was determined using four synthetic datasets each consisting of 200 samples half belonging to one of two classes, and a further two synthetic datasets containing 400 samples, again equally split between the two classes. In datasets 1 to 3, five variables were distributed multinormally, in dataset 1 the classes are distributed roughly circularly but with a significant degree of overlap, in dataset 2, the distribution is in elongated hyperellipsoids with small overlap, and in dataset 3 there is a region of complete overlap between classes. In dataset 4 two variables are distributed in a crescent shape. In datasets 5 and 6, 100 variables were generated from multinormal populations, some of which were potential discriminators, however a large proportion of the variables were designed to be uninformative. The methods were optimised using a training set and their performance evaluated using a test set: this was repeated 100 times for different test and training set splits. The average % correctly classified was computed for each class and model, as well as the model stability for each sample (the proportion of times the sample is classified into the same group over all 100 iterations). The conclusions are that the performance of the classifiers depends very much on the distribution of data. Approaches such as LVQ and SVMs that try to determine complex boundaries perform best when the data is not normally distributed such as in dataset 4, but can be prone to overfitting otherwise. QDA tends to perform best on multinormal data although it can be influenced by non-discriminative variables which show a difference in variance.

The abstract nature of the more sophisticated existing calibration function results requires calibration functions to be explicitly derived on a case-by-case basis, requiring repeated efforts whenever bounds for a new surrogate loss are required. We devise a streamlined analysis that simplifies the process of deriving calibration functions for a large number of surrogate losses that have been proposed in the literature. The effort of deriving calibration functions is then surmised in verifying, for a chosen surrogate loss, a small number of conditions that we introduce. As case studies, we recover existing calibration functions for the well-known loss of Lee et al. (2004), and also provide novel calibration functions for well-known losses, including the one-versus-all loss and the logistic regression loss, plus a number of other losses that have been shown to be classification-calibrated in the past, but for which no calibration function had been derived.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": "1609.06385", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2523051598", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2724161", "2833811", "3100542", "583661", "37925315", "18367172", "466118", "119844025", "225244", "10084041", "1878582", "15538680", "6707032", "7087225", "18876084", "12246009", "204175221", "6101385", "9215575", "19022539", "243363", "16190316", "5616977", "10859485", "392161", "13391792", "20541356", "4515406", "16660598", "86426456", "951428", "7138354", "7359186", "15527239"], "inbound_citations": ["143423650", "202768353"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:351824"}

Lately, the amount of data is increasing and machine learning algorithms with low computational costs and efficient ensemble methods are needed. Alternating Decision Forest (ADF) is an efficient ensemble method known for its high performance and low computational costs. ADFs introduce weights representing the degree of prediction accuracy for each piece of training data and randomly select attribute variables for each node. This method can effectively construct an ensemble model that can predict training data accurately while allowing each decision tree to retain different features. However, outliers can cause overfitting, and since candidates of branch conditions vary for nodes in ADFs, there is a possibility that prediction accuracy will deteriorate because the fitness of training data is highly restrained. In order to improve prediction accuracy, we focus on the prediction results for new data. That is to say, we introduce bootstrap sampling so that the algorithm can generate out-of-bag (OOB) datasets for each tree in the training phase. Additionally, we construct an effective ensemble of decision trees to improve generalization ability by considering the prediction accuracy for OOB data.

As a pre-requisite, the vehicles know their positions and the vehicles send their positions in the packets. The positioning system can thus perform a training sequence and build a model. The system is then able to handle a prediction request. In this request, a vehicle without external positioning will request its position from the neighboring RSUs. The RSUs which receive this request message from the vehicle will know the power at which the message was received and will study the positioning request using the training set.

Recently, machine learning approaches are applied to detect the complex DDoS attacks and improve the efficiency and robustness of the intrusion detection system. In this research, the algorithm is designed to balance the detection rate and its efficiency. The detection algorithm combines the Power Spectral Density (PSD) entropy function and Support Vector Machine to detect LDoS traffic from normal traffic. In our solution, the detection rate and efficiency are adjustable based on the parameter in the decision algorithm. To have high efficiency, the detection method will always detect the attacks by calculating PSD-entropy first and compare it with the two adaptive thresholds. The thresholds can efficiently filter nearly 19% of the samples with a high detection rate. To minimize the computational cost and look only for the patterns that are most relevant for detection, Support Vector Machine based machine learning model is applied to learn the traffic pattern and select appropriate features for detection algorithm.

First, we exhibit the distance and dropout rates function in a formal way. Second, we propose our model with algorithm in deep transfer learning networks.

The underlying probabilistic model is a temporal tree-structured Markov Random Field. Our algorithm takes as input user labeled key frame(s) of a video sequence. We then infer the marginal class posteriors of the unlabeled pixels. These posteriors are used to learn pixel unaries by training a decision forest in a semi-supervised manner. We term this the soft label Random Forest (slRF), in which the pixel posterior is treated as its vector label at training time. This allows us to use the standard Shannon entropy-based information gain as objective function, in an iterative, self-training semi-supervised framework. This is in contrast to the transductive forest of Chap. 8 which uses separate entropy measures for labeled and unlabeled data, respectively. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in foreground/background segmentation problems, based on quantitative studies on the challenging SegTrack dataset. We envisage our results to have wide applicability, including harvesting labeled video data for several applications such as action recognition, shape learning and developing priors for video segmentation.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4471-4929-3_16", "venue": "Decision Forests for Computer Vision and Medical Image Analysis", "journal": "Decision Forests for Computer Vision and Medical Image Analysis", "mag_id": "202887032", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:118259683"}

In this paper we introduce a new approach for the semi-automatic verification of a specific part of the, possibly outdated GIS database, namely cropland and grassland objects, using mono-temporal very high resolution (VHR) multispectral satellite images. The approach consists of two steps: first, a supervised pixel-based classification based on a Markov Random Field is employed to extract image regions which contain agricultural areas (without distinction between cropland and grassland), and these regions are intersected with boundaries of the agricultural objects from the GIS database. Subsequently, GIS objects labelled as cropland or grassland in the database and showing agricultural areas in the image are subdivided into different homogeneous regions by means of image segmentation, followed by a classification of these segments into either cropland or grassland using a Support Vector Machine. The classification result of all segments belonging to one GIS object are finally merged and compared with the GIS database label. The developed approach was tested on a number of images. The evaluation shows that errors in the GIS database can be significantly reduced while also speeding up the whole verification task when compared to a manual process.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2014.09.008", "venue": null, "journal": "Isprs Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing", "mag_id": "1963854524", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["54688329", "1836342", "203699595", "53996110", "54939297", "54730839", "3678588", "199370226", "48353438", "60443071", "53521162"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:119958595"}

Multiple arrays of magnetic sensors are used to detect the plasma position inside a Tokamak. This paper presents the application of different machine learning (ML) based fault detection techniques for the identification and classification of faults that happen in typical magnetic position sensors. The performances of these machine learning based fault detection algorithms are evaluated for two scenarios as follows. Firstly, during the \u201cSelf-Test\u201d mode, i.e., before the start-up of the plasma discharge, with known current waveforms in the external coils. Secondly, by using the simulated plasma discharge waveforms. Their performances are compared in terms of computational complexities and latency in view of deciding the best fault detection algorithm. The machine learning techniques are implemented in real-time on the Xilinx Kintex-7 and Xilinx Zync-7 series FPGA. From the obtained comparison results, it is observed that out of the six machine learning approaches, namely Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest classifier (RF) employed for Tokamak sensor fault detection, the Random Forest Classifier based approach was found to be the best in terms of speed and accuracy.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.fusengdes.2019.111401", "venue": null, "journal": "Fusion Engineering and Design", "mag_id": "2990692968", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213704534"}
