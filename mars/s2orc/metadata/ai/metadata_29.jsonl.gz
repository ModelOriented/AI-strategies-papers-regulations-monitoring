An automated process was developed for forest stratification using orthoimages. A genetic algorithm was applied for variable screening. Variable subsets of different sizes were employed for simultaneous predictions of structural forest attributes using the \u2018Random Forest\u2019 (RF) method. Performance was assessed by leave-one-out cross-validations on bootstrap resample data. Results indicate that the stratification of forest notably improved the results of predictions.

In this paper, we utilize a simple and effective graph construction method to construct the graph over data lying on multiple data manifolds. The method can guarantee the connectiveness between pair-wise data points. Then, the global pair-wise data similarity is naturally characterized by geodesic distance-based joint probability, where the geodesic distance is approximated by the graph distance.

Actually almost the opposite is true: for even the smallest problems vast amounts of knowledge are necessary. So the key to systems that would aid humans or even replace them in some areas is knowledge. Humans use texts written in natural language as one of the primary knowledge sources. Natural language is by definition ambiguous and therefore less appropriate for machine learning. For machine processing and use the knowledge must be in a formal; machine readable format. Research in recent years has focused on knowledge acquisition and formalization from natural language sources (documents, web pages). The process requires several research areas in order to function and is highly complex. The necessary steps usually are: natural language processing (transformation to plain text, syntactic and semantic analysis), knowledge extraction, knowledge formalization and knowledge representation. The same is valid for learning of domain specific knowledge although the very first activity is the domain definition. These are the areas that this chapter focuses on; the approaches, methodologies and techniques for learning from natural language sources. Since this topic covers multiple research areas and every area is extensive, we have chosen to segment this chapter into five content segments (excluding introduction, conclusion and references). In the second segment we will define the term domain and provide the reader with an overview of domain engineering (domain analysis, domain design and domain implementation). The third segment will present natural language processing. In this segment we provide the user with several levels of natural language analysis and show the process of knowledge acquirement from natural language (NL). Sub segment 3.1 is about theoretical background on syntactic analysis and representational structures. Sub segment 3.2 provides a short summary of semantic analysis as well as current sources for semantic analysis (WordNet, FrameNet). The fourth segment elaborates on knowledge extraction. We define important terms such as data, information and knowledge and discuss on approaches for knowledge acquisition and representation. Segment five is a practical real world (although on a very small scale) scenario on learning from natural language. In this scenario we limit ourselves on a small segment of health/nutrition domain as we acquire, process and formalize knowledge on chocolate consumption. Segment six is the conclusion and segment seven provides the references.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5772/10249", "venue": "Robot Learning", "journal": "Robot Learning", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1585692976", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["121989119", "17432009", "54132309", "16743035", "43580473", "845694", "11607324", "60481265", "7789518", "33069149", "2658668", "62176183", "1830464", "44289589", "42588001", "207158373", "207846993", "59707485", "1436617", "59923691", "195714946", "154501782", "5649717", "36373168", "107884296", "14872223", "60548147", "18366823", "10452"], "inbound_citations": ["60481265"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:60481265"}

The missing data can lead to many problems that negatively affect the safety of power system and cause economic loss.

In order to solve this problem and improve data interpolation accuracy, this paper proposed a WT data imputation method using generative adversarial nets (GAN) with deep learning models. First, conditional GAN is used as the framework to train the generative network. Then convolutional neural network is applied for both the generative model and the discriminative model. Through the zero-sum game between the two models, the imputation model can be well trained. Due to the deep learning models, the trained data imputation model can effectively recover the data with a few parameters of the input data.

Preliminary experiment results show that this method can recognize entity and extract entity relationship effectively.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.14257/astl.2016.121.80", "venue": "AST 2016", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2328100167", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["277918", "12943282", "59076855", "61492122", "7905652", "63969667"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:34000073"}

In ELM, it is implicitly assumed that all samples in training datasets share the same importance. Therefore, when it comes to datasets with outliers or noises, like SVM, ELM may produce suboptimal regression models due to overfitting. In this paper, by equipping ELM with the fuzzy concept, we propose a novelty approach called New Fuzzy ELM NF-ELM to deal with the above problem. In NF-ELM, firstly, different training samples are assigned with different fuzzy-membership values based on their degree of being outliers or noises. Secondly, these membership values are incorporated into the ELM algorithm to make it less sensitive to outliers or noises.

Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is providing valuable information relating copy number aberrations (CNAs) to cancer mechanisms and clinical outcomes. However, challenges exist to interpreting and fully utilizing these data. First, without matched tumor and healthy tissue samples from individuals, distinguishing naturally occurring copy number variations (CNVs) from CNAs is difficult. Second, the large search space of genome wide analyses makes finding combinations of CNAs with improved predictive potential compared to single CNAs challenging. Here we provide novel methods to address these challenges associated with CGH data. Many new resources (e.g. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)), are making large volumes of genomic data publically accessible. However, most datasets do not have matched normal and tumor tissue samples between subjects. We tested matched normal and tissue samples from 30 patients with colorectal, lung, and pancreatic cancer and compared CNVs and CNAs to findings in larger, non-matched samples in TCGA. Even with limited matched samples, this approach allows for the differentiation of CNVs from CNAs discovered in analyses of non-matched samples. ::: ::: In some cases, combinations of CNAs can provide improved predictive capability compared to any single CNA. However, it is computationally intractable to exhaustively test combinations of CNAs in a genome-wide study. To address this limitation, we use a novel approach for CNA feature reduction that minimizes the variance within CNA segments across subjects, and Random Forest Ensemble Classification. This approach provides CNA combinations with balanced accuracies of 83.5% and 94.9% for distinguishing 52 cases of canine ALL/AML and 71 cases of B-CLL/T-CLL, respectively. These two approaches address frequent limitations in the interpretation CGH data. Better distinguishing CNVs and interrogating CNA combinations, can provide additional information about the role of CNAs in disease mechanisms and improve treatment decisions. ::: ::: Citation Format: Daniel Rotroff, Matthew Breen, Alison Motsinger-Reif.

Experiments were carried out on a high-intensity roll magnetic separator to develop a database using four input variables (magnetic flux intensity, particle size, splitter position and roll speed) and two output variables (weight recovery and Fe recovery). The artificial neural network (ANN) and statistical methods (MLRG) were used to model the magnetic separation process.

Moreover, often different physicians have different understandings of patient similarity based on their patient cohorts. The distance metric learned for each individual physician often leads to a limited view of the true underlying distance metric. How to integrate the individual distance metrics from each physician into a globally consistent unif ed metric?

Then we describe the interactive metric learning (iMet) method that can incrementally update an existing metric based on physician feedback in an online fashion.

We consider it in this paper when the learned metric is constrained to be a geodesic distance on a graph that supports the measures of interest. This imposes a rich structure for candidate metrics, but also enables far more efficient learning procedures when compared to a direct optimization over the space of all metric matrices. We use this setting to tackle an inverse problem stemming from the observation of a density evolving with time: we seek a graph ground metric such that the OT interpolation between the starting and ending densities that result from that ground metric agrees with the observed evolution.

Although machine learning can be used for this, in general, machine learning tools on the web were not designed for biologist users. They require users to create suitable biological datasets and often produce results that are hard to interpret. Objective Our aim is to develop a freely available web server, named PerformIng Classification and Knowledge Extraction via Rules using random forests on Human Genes (PICKER-HG), aimed at biologists looking for a straightforward application of a powerful machine learning technique (random forests) to their data. Results We have developed the first web server that, as far as we know, dynamically constructs a classification dataset, given a list of human genes with annotations entered by the user, and outputs classification rules extracted of a Random Forest model. The web server can also classify a list of genes whose class labels are unknown, potentially assisting biologists investigating the association between class labels of interest and human genes.

Forty-eight MS patients without symptoms of optic neuritis and forty-eight healthy control subjects were selected. Swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) was performed using a DRI (deep-range imaging) Triton OCT device (Topcon Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Mean values (right and left eye) for macular thickness (retinal and choroidal layers) and peripapillary area (retinal nerve fibre layer, retinal, ganglion cell layer\u2014GCL, and choroidal layers) were compared between both groups. Based on the analysis of the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), the 3 variables with the greatest discriminant capacity were selected to form the feature vector. A SVM was used as an automatic classifier, obtaining the confusion matrix using leave-one-out cross-validation. Classification performance was assessed with Matthew\u2019s correlation coefficient (MCC) and the AUCCLASSIFIER. The most discriminant variables were found to be the total GCL++ thickness (between inner limiting membrane to inner nuclear layer boundaries), evaluated in the peripapillary area and macular retina thickness in the nasal quadrant of the outer and inner rings. Using the SVM classifier, we obtained the following values: MCC = 0.81, sensitivity = 0.89, specificity = 0.92, accuracy = 0.91, and AUCCLASSIFIER = 0.97.

Speech-operated devices in particular provide a great service to drivers by minimizing distraction, so that they can keep their hands on the wheel and their eyes on the road. This presentation will demonstrate our latest development of an in-car dialog system for an MP3 player designed under a joint research effort from Bosch RTC, VW ERL, Stanford CSLI, and SRI STAR Lab funded by NIST ATP [Weng et al 2004] with this goal in mind. This project has developed a number of new technologies, some of which are already incorporated in the system. These include: end-pointing with prosodic cues, error identification and recovering strategies, flexible multi-threaded, multi-device dialog management, and content optimization and organization strategies. A number of important language phenomena are also covered in the system's functionality. For instance, one may use words relying on context, such as 'this,' 'that,' 'it,' and 'them,' to reference items mentioned in particular use contexts. Different types of verbal revision are also permitted by the system, providing a great convenience to its users. The system supports multi-threaded dialogs so that users can diverge to a different topic before the current one is finished and still come back to the first after the second topic is done. To lower the cognitive load on the drivers, the content optimization component organizes any information given to users based on ontological structures, and may also refine users' queries via various strategies. Domain knowledge is represented using OWL, a web ontology language recommended by W3C, which should greatly facilitate its portability to new domains.The spoken dialog system consists of a number of components (see Fig. 1 for details). Instead of the hub architecture employed by Communicator projects [Senef et al, 1998], it is developed in Java and uses a flexible event-based, message-oriented middleware. This allows for dynamic registration of new components. Among the component modules in Figure 1, we use the Nuance speech recognition engine with class-based ngrams and dynamic grammars, and the Nuance Vocalizer as the TTS engine. The Speech Enhancer removes noises and echo. The Prosody module will provide additional features to the Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Dialogue Manager (DM) modules to improve their performance.The NLU module takes a sequence of recognized words and tags, performs a deep linguistic analysis with probabilistic models, and produces an XML-based semantic feature structure representation. Parallel to the deep analysis, a topic classifier assigns top n topics to the utterance, which are used in the cases where the dialog manager cannot make any sense of the parsed structure. The NLU module also supports dynamic updates of the knowledge base.The CSLI DM module mediates and manages interaction. It uses the dialogue-move approach to maintain dialogue context, which is then used to interpret incoming utterances (including fragments and revisions), resolve NPs, construct salient responses, track issues, etc. Dialogue states can also be used to bias SR expectation and improve SR performance, as has been performed in previous applications of the DM. Detailed descriptions of the DM can be found in [Lemon et al 2002; Mirkovic & Cavedon 2005].The Knowledge Manager (KM) controls access to knowledge base sources (such as domain knowledge and device information) and their updates. Domain knowledge is structured according to domain-dependent ontologies. The current KM makes use of OWL, a W3C standard, to represent the ontological relationships between domain entities. Protege (http://protege.stanford.edu), a domain-independent ontology tool, is used to maintain the ontology offline. In a typical interaction, the DM converts a user's query into a semantic frame (i.e. a set of semantic constraints) and sends this to the KM via the content optimizer.The Content Optimization module acts as an intermediary between the dialogue management module and the knowledge management module during the query process. It receives semantic frames from the DM, resolves possible ambiguities, and queries the KM. Depending on the items in the query result as well as the configurable properties, the module selects and performs an appropriate optimization strategy.Early evaluation shows that the system has a task completion rate of 80% on 11 tasks of MP3 player domain, ranging from playing requests to music database queries.

We perform cross domain sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews (books, dvd, kitchen appliances, electronics) and TripAdvisor hotel reviews, effectively classify the reviews to positive and negative polarities by applying various preprocessing techniques like Tokenization, POS Tagging, Lemmatization and Stemming which can enhance the performance of sentiment analysis in terms of accuracy and time to train the classifier. Various methods proposed for document-level sentiment classification like Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machines and Decision Tree are analysed in this work. Cross domain sentiment classification is useful because many times we might not have training corpus of specific domains for which we need to classify the data and also cross domain is favoured by lower computation cost and time.

In this article, a deep learning-based method is presented for ulcer detection and gastrointestinal diseases (ulcer, polyp, bleeding) classification. Modified mask Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) based ulcer segmentation is proposed. The ulcer annotated images are utilized to train the Mask RCNN model to obtain output in the form of bounding box ulcer detected area and mask segmented region. In the classification phase, the ResNet101 pre-trained CNN model is fine-tuned through transfer learning to derive deep features. The acquired deep features are optimized through grasshopper optimization along with minimum distance fitness function. The best-selected features are finally supplied to a Multi-class Support Vector Machine (MSVM) of cubic kernel function for final classification. Experiments have been performed in two-steps; first, the ulcer segmentation results are computed through recall, precision, and Mean Overlap Coefficient (MOC). The ResNet50+FPN as backbone and training all the layers of Mask-RCNN gives best results in terms of MOC = 0.8807 and average precision = 1.0.

In this paper, we propose an approach for classification of brain MR images, based on finding pathology-related patterns through the identification of regional structural changes. The approach combines a probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) technique, which allows to identify image regions through latent topics inferred from the brain MR slices, with a bottom-up Graph-Based Visual Saliency (GBVS) model, which calculates maps of relevant information per region. Regional saliency maps are finally combined into a single map on each slice, obtaining a master saliency map of each brain volume. The proposed approach includes a one-to-one comparison of the saliency maps which feeds a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, to group test subjects into normal or probable AD subjects. A set of 156 brain MR images from healthy (76) and pathological (80) subjects, splitted into a training set (10 non-demented and 10 demented subjects) and one testing set (136 subjects), was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.

SVMs are machine learning systems that use a hypothesis space of linear functions in a Kernel induced higher dimensional feature space. SVMs are optimized by minimizing a bound on a generalized error (risk) measure, rather than just the mean square error over a training set. The utility of this SVM regression approach is demonstrated through applications to the short term forecasts of the biweekly GSL volume. The SVM based reconstruction is used to develop time series forecasts for multiple lead times ranging from the period of two weeks to several months. The reliability of the algorithm in learning and forecasting the dynamics is tested using split sample sensitivity analyses, with a particular interest in forecasting extreme states. Unlike previously reported methodologies, SVMs are able to extract the dynamics using only a few past observed data points (Support Vectors, SV) out of the training examples.

To this end, this paper proposes two augmented CELM models by incorporating the conjugate information of the complex input and the hidden layer, respectively. The approximation capability and the ability to capture the second-order statistics of signals are theoretically analysed.

The generalised use of sequence alignments for inferring function promotes the propagation of errors, and there are limits to its applicability. Several machine learning methods have been applied to predict protein function, but they lose much of the information encoded by protein sequences because they need to transform them to obtain data of fixed length.ResultsWe have developed a machine learning methodology, called peptide programs (PPs), to deal directly with protein sequences and compared its performance with that of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and BLAST in detailed enzyme classification tasks. Overall, the PPs and SVMs had a similar performance in terms of Matthews Correlation Coefficient, but the PPs had generally a higher precision. BLAST performed globally better than both methodologies, but the PPs had better results than BLAST and SVMs for the smaller datasets.ConclusionThe higher precision of the PPs in comparison to the SVMs suggests that dealing with sequences is advantageous for detailed protein classification, as precision is essential to avoid annotation errors. The fact that the PPs performed better than BLAST for the smaller datasets demonstrates the potential of the methodology, but the drop in performance observed for the larger datasets indicates that further development is required.Possible strategies to address this issue include partitioning the datasets into smaller subsets and training individual PPs for each subset, or training several PPs for each dataset and combining them using a bagging strategy.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2724424", "pubmed_id": "19630945", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-10-231", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2048692252", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14441902", "9830086", "16790579", "22919564", "9461126", "38720984", "27192283", "38358535", "664047", "19926445", "7956604", "2136530", "1304875", "15940296", "2944273", "14641265", "16324693", "1069962", "5464065", "36083833", "11384872", "9434714", "14317314", "207738357", "12389030", "19717804", "135924775"], "inbound_citations": ["10389705"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7693870"}

First of all, our approach segments color images in small areas, which will be characterized later by color and texture attributes. These features are classified using the K-NN rule or the Support Vector Machines (SVM) method. A global scene model is obtained where the road extraction is used to initialize the active contour tracking process. Some of the road features are also used, in a focalized gradient zone in order to attract active contour to the road boundary. Besides, using the scene model information we can correct the transient errors generated in the tracking procedure. This algorithm has been evaluated on a great number of images, acquired either on secondary tarred roads or on earthen roads, mainly in countryside scenes. Results obtained on image sequences show the robustness of the proposed approach.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2183589716", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": ["16702920", "17887721", "209081", "120595550", "33312054", "12946615", "129481902", "14001890", "10110267"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18510096"}

However, most of these boosting algorithms were designed for static data, thus they can not be directly applied to on-line learning and incremental learning. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that incrementally updates the classification model built upon gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), namely iGBDT. The main idea of iGBDT is to incrementally learn a new model but without running GBDT from scratch, when new data is dynamically arriving in batch. We conduct large-scale experiments to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of iGBDT. All the experimental results show that, in terms of model building/updating time, iGBDT obtains significantly better performance than the conventional practice that always runs GBDT from scratch when a new batch of data arrives, while still keeping the same classification accuracy. iGBDT can be used in many applications that require in-time analysis of continuously arriving or real-time user-generated data, such as behaviour targeting, Internet advertising, recommender systems, etc.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11063-019-09999-3", "venue": "Neural Processing Letters", "journal": "Neural Processing Letters", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2913054853", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["18559882", "10186661", "1108909", "6618074", "5763769", "481668", "61291571", "6644398", "7955044", "705946", "18621060", "6416602", "6032045", "8365295", "16796908", "2811715", "6748242", "17648213", "10210651", "398847", "9012937", "13158356"], "inbound_citations": ["204767765"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61156124"}

The gene expression produced by microarray technology that carries the information from genes is then matched to a specific cancer condition. The problems that often appear in the classification using microarray data are high-dimensional data and imbalanced class. The problem of high-dimensional data can be solved by using Fast Correlated Based Filter (FCBF) feature selection. In this paper, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used because of its advantages. However, some studies mention that almost all classifier model including SVM are sensitive with respect to imbalanced class. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is one of the prepocessing data methods in handling imbalanced class based on sampling approach by increasing the number of samples from the minority class. This method often works well but sometimes it might suffer from over-fitting problem. One other alternative approach in improving the performance of imbalanced data classification is boosting. This method constructs a powerful final classifier by combining a set of SVMs as base classifier during the iteration process. So, it can improve the classification performance. In this study, colon cancer and myeloma data are used in the analysis. The results show that SMOTEBoost with SVM as base classifier outperforms SVM, SMOTE-SVM, and AdaBoost with SVM as base classifier by looking on G-mean metric.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.procs.2018.10.517", "venue": "INNS Conference on Big Data", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2901721989", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["215443250", "209429381"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:58952539"}

Speech-driven methods offer an alternative approach, learning the relationship between speech and head movements from real recordings. However, previous studies do not generate novel realizations for a repeated speech signal. Conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) provides a framework to generate multiple realizations of head movements for each speech segment by sampling from a conditioned distribution. We build a conditional GAN with bidirectional long-short term memory (BLSTM), which is suitable for capturing the long-short term dependencies of time-continuous signals. This model learns the distribution of head movements conditioned on speech prosodic features.

In order to take into account the heterogeneity of the semantic network, meta-path-based topological patterns were investigated for link prediction. Supervised machine learning models were constructed based on meta-path topological features of an enriched semantic network, which was derived from Chem2Bio2RDF, and was expanded by adding compound and protein similarity neighboring links obtained from the PubChem databases. The additional semantic links significantly improved the predictive performance of the supervised learning models. The binary classification model built upon the enriched feature space using the Random Forest algorithm significantly outperformed an existing semantic link prediction algorithm, Semantic Link Association Prediction (SLAP), to predict unknown links between compounds and protein targets in an evolving network. In addition to link prediction, Random Forest also has an intrinsic feature ranking algorithm, which can be used to select the important topological features that contribute to link prediction. The proposed framework has been demonstrated as a powerful alternative to SLAP in order to predict DTIs using the semantic network that integrates chemical, pharmacological, genomic, biological, functional, and biomedical information into a unified framework.

How to efficiently represent and recognize the scenes from such high-resolution image data has become a critical task. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised feature learning framework for scene classification. By using the saliency detection algorithm, we extract a representative set of patches from the salient regions in the image data set. These unlabeled data patches are exploited by an unsupervised feature learning method to learn a set of feature extractors which are robust and efficient and do not need elaborately designed descriptors such as the scale-invariant-feature-transform-based algorithm. We show that the statistics generated from the learned feature extractors can characterize a complex scene very well and can produce excellent classification accuracy. In order to reduce overfitting in the feature learning step, we further employ a recently developed regularization method called \u201cdropout,\u201d which has proved to be very effective in image classification. In the experiments, the proposed method was applied to two challenging high-resolution data sets: the UC Merced data set containing 21 different aerial scene categories with a submeter resolution and the Sydney data set containing seven land-use categories with a 60-cm spatial resolution. The proposed method obtained results that were equal to or even better than the previous best results with the UC Merced data set, and it also obtained the highest accuracy with the Sydney data set, demonstrating that the proposed unsupervised-feature-learning-based scene classification method provides more accurate classification results than the other latent-Dirichlet-allocation-based methods and the sparse coding method.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TGRS.2014.2357078", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2086866337", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["206691461", "14457153", "17606900", "231648", "3177797", "9265597", "8519109", "2949497", "13976978", "9686347", "1658773", "207020771", "90113", "3761655", "1744852", "8772285", "14201947", "207168299", "12589862", "996073", "120349231", "308212", "206769720", "961425", "4659176", "2161592", "4637792", "4641994", "9883642", "14832074", "195908774", "993769", "1165496"], "inbound_citations": ["54463579", "133940870", "3823778", "7531630", "90259933", "5831911", "2206412", "4397697", "3839934", "59232525", "9745455", "14880994", "15682415", "38923308", "195572228", "28544003", "215056004", "58273800", "16359388", "63014565", "5142777", "32012283", "49416821", "51867928", "22975757", "15948014", "90262094", "39901204", "23909025", "3444165", "18300015", "209320179", "52899300", "173987225", "211845794", "6510239", "44074143", "21027625", "59233891", "16327517", "52309627", "20351644", "13978260", "20184199", "209516498", "35237815", "49879694", "203094652", "22513165", "50772768", "4783777", "60443011", "207323480", "67873211", "199012732", "211208384", "548288", "24829449", "7172528", "208037261", "18263771", "35630017", "28231585", "25554984", "210696035", "3511189", "15842150", "14412701", "210973949", "211479061", "24017680", "204208840", "31429268", "128362413", "19963944", "19963944", "29382119", "202707510", "1487700", "202769113", "127214191", "211689637", "7489335", "208039315", "1307414", "8334277", "1262590", "4246700", "126180710", "131777268", "125935633", "16072431", "207832780", "51875149", "57762423", "44708197", "3927530", "150282220", "25009028", "15298934", "8349072", "38428082", "12537710", "13376534", "10397600", "210879921", "22803887", "164869140", "32507542", "201106547", "34724654", "212647521", "54438993", "59620663", "67870502", "127092627", "211211548", "3852282", "10862618", "3046524", "102497843", "53946001", "67789744", "3413210", "10239704", "28007053", "65478950", "5505617", "32417047", "4809177", "198961036", "3398149", "28705282", "5085777", "51884690", "11707694", "104292994", "9443977", "58013453", "24735969", "197430679", "70066149", "25069492", "40816805", "126365535", "208038437", "21226824", "211677643", "1752482", "182849029", "687557", "49545927", "25881523", "115142866", "15429620", "51891339", "55474688", "155089728", "52099172", "28782221", "7417614", "51965457", "52917103", "19677604", "85464220", "46927956", "52001033", "10175419", "4757123", "181540435", "37089428", "678821", "182542276", "30030555", "2575184", "9560434", "202699760", "336043", "1424412", "31975351", "52901771", "130219413", "23666975", "198132251", "51934007", "65063612", "3682921", "4169619", "19576096", "37420972", "3144483", "22270920", "32081688", "4378414", "16387982", "14104415", "2769076", "203656118", "201032419", "52903129", "90263588", "54056805", "215548774", "1202167", "13079847", "35266138", "146093592", "56482035", "2460131", "3819856", "150372387", "52111661", "3390887", "125684011", "52299643", "12018051", "198424375", "49414690", "6621758", "58013755", "53948857"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13904304"}

In this paper, we investigate the application of Population-Based Incremental Learning (PBIL) algorithms, a class of evolutionary algorithms, for problem optimization under dynamic environments. Inspired by the complementarity mechanism in nature, we propose a Dual PBIL that operates on two probability vectors that are dual to each other with respect to the central point in the search space. Using a dynamic problem generating technique we generate a series of dynamic knapsack problems from a randomly generated stationary knapsack problem and carry out experimental study comparing the performance of investigated PBILs and one traditional genetic algorithm.

Although many interesting research results have been achieved, there are still a lot of difficulties in real applications because of their unsatisfying generalization performance or intensive computation cost. This paper presents an Incremental Extreme Learning Machine (IELM) which is developed based on Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), a unified framework of LS-SVM and PSVM presented by Hang et al. (2011) in [15]. Under different application demand and different computational cost and efficiency, three different alternative solutions of IELM are achieved. Detailed comparisons of the IELM algorithm with other incremental algorithms are achieved by simulation on benchmark problems and real critical dimension (CD) prediction problem in lithography of actual semiconductor production line. The results show that kernel based IELM solution performs best while least square IELM solution is the fastest of the three alterative solutions when the number of training data is huge. All the results show that the presented IELM algorithms have better performance than other incremental algorithms such as online sequential ELM (OS-ELM) presented by Liang et al.

Firstly, the vibration signals of the check valve are decomposed by Differential Empirical Mode Decomposition (DEMD), and the Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) containing more feature information are selected to reconstruct the signals by correlation coefficient method. Secondly, Wigner-Ville Distribution (WVD) is used to analysis the reconstruct signals and obtain the time-frequency images, then NMF is applied to decompose the time-frequency image matrixes and get the feature matrix. Finally, the feature vectors are classified via the Support Vector Machine (SVM) which is optimized by Genetic Algorithm (GA) to complete the fault diagnosis of the high pressure diaphragm pump check valve. The method is validated using data from three operating states of the high pressure diaphragm pump check valve. The experimental result shows that the proposed method can effectively extract the fault features and identify fault types of the check valve.

In contrast, our algorithm computes the Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel directly on the large RDF graph, but still retains the subgraph information.

However, there has yet to be a model of contour integration that uses only known V1 elements, operations, and connection patterns.This article introduces such a model, using orient ation selective cells, local cortical circuits, and horizontal intracortical connections. The model is composed of recurrently connected excitatory neurons and inhibitory interneurons, receiving visual input via oriented receptive fields resembling those found in primary visual cortex. Intracortical interactions modify initial activity patterns from input, selectively amplifying the activities of edges that form smooth contours in the image. The neural activities produced by such interactions are oscillatory and edge segments within a contour oscillate in synchrony. It is shown analytically and empirically that the extent of contour enhancement and neural synchrony increases with the smoothness, length, and closure of contours, as observed in exper...", "year": 1998, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "9573412", "doi": "10.1162/089976698300017557", "venue": "Neural Computation", "journal": "Neural Computation", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "116989265,2134394617", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["2822256", "14161111", "86592458", "24524109", "205016575", "1767879", "7416522", "30149117", "24518657", "18325762", "9227970", "16469435", "13987825", "41281582", "1943257", "17055992", "125491054", "9142398", "1257205", "6913797", "36853128", "189925", "23420153", "7932310", "15340643", "34273285", "1115449", "124937374", "19305845", "7528622", "14122928", "10154890", "12849660", "6528525", "22708243", "39651874", "4321526", "13493427", "103799", "8526154", "11985450", "6458199", "959142", "141016786", "19317325", "2991937", "118333997", "18270932", "2216697", "1854215", "14141595", "9847300"], "inbound_citations": ["17432350", "14883497", "15133028", "14257310", "206756576", "215290618", "14523557", "9732292", "14918739", "1548345", "3742418", "18794196", "1166924", "60947104", "44124157", "53944299", "11186051", "10283027", "17738282", "1078664", "2204707", "14520419", "17453335", "17237131", "7861048", "201817757", "214763408", "12650890", "1910523", "62776171", "1029238", "5153540", "25776047", "215675818", "14738772", "11743980", "90837344", "12647249", "3660562", "5840876", "212643847", "10105111", "44210576", "16536667", "215070823", "17796495", "201843985", "10868734", "25193600", "11708077", "5799929", "7611111", "60810980", "18858931", "205663197", "17255053", "18509042", "25324231", "166956", "206096433", "89884836", "16204727", "9751137", "18295811", "12790510", "195680560", "1049965", "55339534", "16840092", "39991474", "8928112", "120017287", "8456103", "10517048", "58906887", "102350589", "10169375", "201210286", "15137975", "206756203", "1534791", "11214743", "25952975", "215010916", "1884928", "1896960", "18021293", "17244610", "215487379", "10979746", "35380158", "10567453", "31283732", "6334306", "5967697", "18404159", "13627257", "3568266", "41365521", "12411745", "14919559", "13141953", "16958846", "16003474", "7066707", "5714058", "42725219", "10570768", "7586303", "1930942", "12717538", "17365010", "10713134", "14239881", "8279343", "16642217", "17544283", "2046662", "125984409", "17313486", "13604704", "408965", "5314936", "54162357", "14131436", "16289550", "17552077", "17391409", "1183801", "12717527", "42164402", "340798", "8614476", "202688390", "8212332", "16958008", "9372795", "5664268", "7571958", "12263168", "16584371", "7037576", "88451102", "18760669", "1918374", "18522955", "8091037", "26006588", "712283", "9596240", "13411369", "18494105", "215586282", "9485455", "15453268", "32502323", "23127460", "215177954", "6087243", "788260", "1603835", "5693755", "16442055", "400154", "202565588", "10762371", "13038258", "2103094", "1800002", "880912", "17066096", "16272821", "32362027", "14818601", "6159359", "18422641", "18042026", "14848833", "15015619", "6788411", "13280740", "8705321", "70009599", "20810952", "2555507", "14979479", "166341", "14204928", "123224119", "15251890", "2869317", "7734359", "10239109", "17374900", "3580597", "155813282", "10805884", "8898576", "20301331", "1991419", "16373922", "4894952", "10865315", "329761", "9896221", "29398274", "7922901", "11832513", "14144234", "53429270", "14072069", "25782712", "11785116", "120269079", "7073631", "14426150", "51687477", "11623605", "37641509", "2291858", "1469876", "15798380", "16137906", "1083740", "1899949", "11038260", "90896871", "7074753", "13898359", "16526687", "1994281", "195871013", "17454647", "11184516", "23188130", "20890445", "11005007", "15110812", "14939532", "19382189", "14517041", "7367960", "10941708", "35388361", "6054690", "14402489", "8757503", "1612190", "205397675", "18849346", "14210890", "728798", "1738138", "8140610", "145742496", "13490644", "34343556", "9595505", "5570465", "18575297", "26303100", "15671108", "25584696", "13416792", "289790", "7466265", "15415397", "9747329", "18374943", "22918984"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13022636"}

Hence, the use of Surface Electromyography (sEMG) signals to predict upper extremity movement is an area of interest in the research community. A less established technique, Force Myography (FMG), which uses force sensors to detect forearm muscle contraction patterns, is also able to detect some movements of the arm. This paper investigates the comparative performance of sEMG and FMG when predicting wrist, forearm and elbow positions using signals extracted from the forearm only. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifiers were used to evaluate the prediction performance of both FMG and sEMG data. Ten healthy volunteers participated in this study. Under a cross validation across a repetition evaluation scheme, the SVM classifier obtained averaged accuracies of 84.3%, 82.4% and 71.0%, respectively, for predicting elbow, forearm and wrist positions using FMG; while sEMG yielded 75.4%, 83.4% and 92.4% accuracies for predicting the same respective positions. The accuracies obtained using SVM are slightly, but statistical significantly, higher than the ones obtained using LDA. However, the trends on the classification performances between FMG and sEMG are consistent. These results also indicate that the forearm FMG pattern is highly influenced by the change of elbow position, while the forearm sEMG is less subjected to the change. Overall, both forearm FMG and sEMG techniques provide abundant information that can be utilized for tracking the upper extremity movements.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/S1672-6529(16)60398-0", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Bionic Engineering", "mag_id": "2604218194", "mag_field_of_study": ["Materials Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["182486502", "204231620", "204833544", "53031652", "73511610", "210889236", "53427146", "25972520", "208019739", "169037039", "206098042", "169040366"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:136178033"}

Recently, segmentation methods based on fully convolutional networks (FCNs) have achieved great success for general images. This success is primarily related to FCNs leveraging large labelled datasets to learn features that correspond to the shallow appearance and the deep semantics of the images. Such large labelled datasets, however, are usually not available for medical images. So researchers have used specific cost functions and post-processing algorithms to refine the coarse boundaries of the results to improve the FCN performance in skin lesion segmentation. These methods are heavily reliant on tuning many parameters and post-processing techniques. In this paper, we adopt the generative adversarial networks (GANs) given their inherent ability to produce consistent and realistic image features by using deep neural networks and adversarial learning concepts. We build upon the GAN with a novel stacked adversarial learning architecture such that skin lesion features can be learned, iteratively, in a class-specific manner. The outputs from our method are then added to the existing FCN training data, thus increasing the overall feature diversity. We evaluated our method on the ISIC 2017 skin lesion segmentation challenge dataset; we show that it is more accurate and robust when compared to the existing skin state-of-the-art methods.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ISBI.2019.8759479", "venue": "2019 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2019)", "journal": "2019 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2019)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2958547846", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1066884", "2129516", "2343070", "56507745", "3333267", "206750179", "206616262", "1033682", "53528394", "207763512", "12803511", "6200260", "206594692", "14124313", "64239542", "39244443", "9376878"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195883328"}

Unlike General Game Playing, we have envisioned GVGP will not require a prescribed language to facilitate understanding of the logic of the game: requiring the computational agent to ascertain these facts for itself. However, we would still require means to define the wide range of problems the GVGP agents may face for the purpose of classification. Not only would such a language provide means to encapsulate the features and mechanics of a game for the purposes of human understanding, but also provide context for the evaluation of GVGP agents having completed playing. Outside of the issues of classification, there is also the opportunity for automatic game generation. Given the intent of the GVGP group to work within a framework akin to the one of the Physical Travelling Salesman Problem (PTSP), we aim to attach a code-base to the VGDL compiler that derives implementations of these games from the definition that can be used in conjunction with GVGP. Implementing such a compiler could provide numerous opportunities; users could modify existing games very quickly, or have a library of existing implementations defined within the language (e.g. an Asteroids ship or a Mario avatar) that have pre-existing, parameterised behaviours that can be customised for the users specific purposes. Provided the language is fit for purpose, automatic game creation could be explored further through experimentation with machine learning algorithms, furthering research in game creation and design. In order for both of these perceived functions to be realised and to ensure it is suitable for a large user base we recognise that the language carries several key requirements. Not only must it be human-readable, but retain the capability to be both expressive and extensible whilst equally simple as it is general. In our preliminary discussions, we sought to define the key requirements and challenges in constructing a new VGDL that will become part of the GVGP process. From this we have proposed an initial design to the semantics of the language and the components required to define a given game.

The application and combination of dedicated computational intelligence methods holds a great promise for tackling the feature selection and classification. In this work we present a Differential Evolution (DE) approach for the efficient automated gene subset selection. In this model, the selected subsets are evaluated by means of their classification rate using a Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier. The proposed approach is tested on DLBCL Lymphoma and Colon Tumor gene expression datasets. Experiments lying in effectiveness and biological analyses of the results, in addition to comparisons with related methods in the literature, indicate that our DE-SVM model is highly reliable and competitive. I. INTRODUCTION DNA Microarrays (MA) (13) allow the scientists to simulta- neously analyze thousands of genes, and thus giving important insights about cell's function, since changes in the physio-logy of an organism are generally associated with changes in gene ensembles of expression patterns. The vast amount of data involved in a typical Microarray experiment usually requires to perform a complex statistical analysis, with the important goal of making the classification of the dataset into correct classes. The key issue in this classification is to identify significant and representative gene subsets that may be used to predict class membership for new external samples. Furthermore, these subsets should be as small as possible in order to develop fast and low consuming processes for the future class prediction. The main difficulty in Microarray classification versus other domains is the availability of a relatively small number of samples in comparison with the number of genes in each sample (between 2,000 and more than 10,000 in MA). In addition, expression data are highly redundant and noisy, and of most genes are believed to be uninformative with respect to studied classes, as only a fraction of genes may present distinct profiles for different classes of samples. In this context, machine learning techniques have been applied to handle with large and heterogeneous datasets, since they are capable to isolate the useful information by rejecting redundancies. Concretely, feature selection is often considered as a necessary preprocess step to analyze large datasets, as this method can reduce the dimensionality of the datasets and often conducts to better analyses (9). Feature selection (gene selection in Biology) for gene expression analysis in cancer prediction often uses wrapper classification methods to discriminate a type of tumor (9), (11), to reduce the number of genes to investigate in case of a new patient, and also to assist in drug discovery and early diagnosis.

Here we explored whether a classical EMG-based patterns recognition approach could be employed to predict patients\u2019 intentions while attempting to generate goal-directed movements in the horizontal plane.MethodsNine right-handed healthy subjects and seven right-handed stroke survivors performed reaching movements in the horizontal plane. EMG signals were recorded and used to identify the intended motion direction of the subjects. To this aim, a standard pattern recognition algorithm (i.e., Support Vector Machine, SVM) was used. Different tests were carried out to understand the role of the inter- and intra-subjects\u2019 variability in affecting classifier accuracy. Abnormal muscular spatial patterns generating misclassification were evaluated by means of an assessment index calculated from the results achieved with the PCA, i.e., the so-called Coefficient of Expressiveness (CoE).ResultsProcessing the EMG signals of the healthy subjects, in most of the cases we were able to build a static functional map of the EMG activation patterns for point-to-point reaching movements on the horizontal plane. On the contrary, when processing the EMG signals of the pathological subjects a good classification was not possible. In particular, patients\u2019 aimed movement direction was not predictable with sufficient accuracy either when using the general map extracted from data of normal subjects and when tuning the classifier on the EMG signals recorded from each patient.ConclusionsThe experimental findings herein reported show that the use of EMG patterns recognition approach might not be practical to decode movement intention in subjects with neurological injury such as stroke. Rather than estimate motion from EMGs, future scenarios should encourage the utilization of these signals to detect and interpret the normal and abnormal muscle patterns and provide feedback on their correct recruitment.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3729537", "pubmed_id": "23855907", "doi": "10.1186/1743-0003-10-75", "venue": "Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation", "journal": "Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2244026580,2096209111", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Psychology"], "outbound_citations": ["1328110", "847104", "29522386", "3083250", "25040506", "12008369", "8991741", "40413874", "206759569", "24286426", "11349583", "206608807", "1370814", "49587944", "3493984", "18380459", "12574943", "152127219", "15416579", "41130752", "24790668", "11495237", "16722627", "14228872", "19245788", "12304823", "30619565", "8479312", "25293393", "110923482", "6462282", "961425", "194951", "19406896", "39313352", "16506217", "10897917", "6019912", "41206984", "5166617", "22828444", "9462555", "38988166", "25080393", "23959628", "1658246", "6895419", "18329276", "443230", "13772519", "12674148"], "inbound_citations": ["71145440", "24062963", "51894901", "17235703", "214871091", "17808178", "11409025", "4634070", "3990020", "50782759", "204231620", "24595024", "195064765", "19122787", "3434951", "18746257", "56008507", "46796852", "9563841", "208157858", "3223656", "53287805", "212423108", "199437577", "594860", "143422551", "51614518", "208227341", "204231736", "10836426", "3558673", "214842399", "52113588", "206761445", "26605320", "27036394", "3884", "20342893", "7006790", "116312715", "4507874", "7536256", "117742785", "49413916", "46931335", "19992664", "53139149", "53098842", "206243843", "151530557", "51865239"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7863252"}

Spatio-temporal crop phenological information helps in understanding trends in food supply, planning of seed/fertilizer inputs, etc. in a region. Rice is one of the major food sources for many regions of the world especially in monsoon Asia and accounts for more than 11 % of the global cropland. Accurate, on-time and early information on spatial distribution of rice would be useful for stakeholders (cultivators, fertilizer/pesticide manufacturers and agriculture extension agencies) to effectively plan supply of inputs, market activities. Also, government agencies can plan and formulate policies regarding food security. Conventional methods involves manual surveying for developing spatio-temporal crop datasets while remote sensing satellite observations provide cost effective alternatives with better spatial extent and temporal frequency. Remote sensing is one of the effective technologies to map the areal extent of the crops using optical as well as microwave/Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) sensors. Cloud cover is the major problem faced in using the optical datasets during monsoon (June to Sept. locally called Kharif season). Hence, Sentinel-1 C-band (center frequency: 5.405 GHz) RADAR sensor launched by European Space Agency (ESA) which has an Interferometric Wide-swath mode (IW) with dual polarization (VV and VH) has been used for rice area mapping. Limited studies have attempted to establish operational early season rice area mapping to facilitate local governance, agri-input management and crop growers. The key contribution of this work is towards operational near real time and early season rice area mapping using multi-temporal SAR data on GEE platform. The study has been carried out in four districts viz., Guntur, Krishna, East Godavari andWest Godavari from Andhra Pradesh (AP), India during the period of Kharif 2017. The study region is also called as coastal AP where rice transplanting during the Kharif season is carried out during mid Jun. till Aug. and harvesting during Oct. to mid Dec. months. The training data for various classes viz, Rice, NonRice-Agriculture, Waterbodies, Settlements, Forest and Aquaculture have been obtained from GEE, Global Land Cover (GLC) layers developed by ESA and field observations. We have evaluated the performance of Random Forest (RF) classifier by varying the number of trees and incrementally adding the SAR images for model training. Initially the model has been trained considering two images available from mid June 2017. Further, various models have been trained by adding one consecutive image till end of August 2017 and classification performance has been evaluated on validation dataset. The classified output has been further masked with agriculture non-agriculture layer derived from global land-cover layer obtained from ESA. Analysis shows that incremental addition of temporal observations improves the performance of the classifier. The overall classification accuracy ranges between 78.11 to 87.00 %. We have found that RF classifier with 30 trees trained on six images available from mid June till end August performed better with classification accuracy of 87.00 %. However, accuracy assessment performed using independent stratified random sampling approach showed the classification accuracy of 84.45 %.

Hence, we address this problem based on the proposed spatio-temporal graph modeling, exploiting both the intra-frame similarity and inter-frame consistency. Specifically, we first represent a point cloud sequence on graphs and model it via spatio-temporal Gaussian Markov Random Fields on defined patches.

Computer-assisted classification of cancer cells can alleviate the burden of manual labeling and help cancer research. In this paper, we present a novel computerized method for cancer cell line image classification. The aim is to automatically classify 14 different classes of cell lines including 7 classes of breast and 7 classes of liver cancer cells. Microscopic images containing irregular carcinoma cell patterns are represented by subwindows which correspond to foreground pixels. For each subwindow, a covariance descriptor utilizing the dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-WT) coefficients and several morphological attributes are computed. Directionally selective DT-WT feature parameters are preferred primarily because of their ability to characterize edges at multiple orientations which is the characteristic feature of carcinoma cell line images. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with radial basis function (RBF) kernel is employed for final classification. Over a dataset of 840 images, we achieve an accuracy above 98%, which outperforms the classical covariance-based methods.

In this paper, a novel framework for Adaptive Indoor Tracking using Recurrent models, in combination with Generative networks for new data generation (recovery), is presented (RecTrack-GAN).

Secondly, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) takes as input the RSSI parameters collected by a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and estimates of both orientation and velocity using devices equipped with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors, and learns to model the human movement based on these parameters. Thirdly, a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) is used to perform data recovering when no measurements are received and to update the Fingerprinting database taking into account the day time.

One strategy that can be used to address these issues is the utilization of healthcare information systems (HIS) for decision support and knowledge management. Indeed, healthcare facilities have at their disposal vast amounts of data which are often organized into useful models. The most critical defy is to generate relevant information from this data. The extracted knowledge should support system to act in an appropriate manner. In this paper, we offer four case studies from the Lebanese healthcare domain (acute appendicitis, premature birth, Osteoporosis, and coronary heart disease) in which prediction systems were developed for decision support using data mining. Our contribution is the application, of our novel reduction technique called Dynamic Rough Sets Attribute Reduction (DRSAR) with multi classifier Random Forest (RF), in HIS. The efficiency of our approach has been carefully tackled within these case studies.

In Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, illegal logging increased and reforestation on abandoned farmland was widespread after the breakdown of socialism, and the region's forest cover trends remain overall largely unclear. Our goal here was to map forest cover change and to assess the extent of illegal logging and reforestation in the Ukrainian Carpathians. We used Landsat TM/ETM+ images and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to derive forest change trajectories between 1988 and 2007 for the entire Ukrainian Carpathians. We calculated logging and reforestation rates, and compared Landsat-based forest trends to official statistics and inventory maps. Our classification resulted in reliable forest/non-forest maps (overall accuracies between 97.1%\u201398.01%) and high clear cut detection rates (on average 89.4%). Forest cover change was widespread in the Ukrainian Carpathians between 1988 and 2007. We found forest cover increase in peripheral areas, forest loss in the interior Carpathians, and increased logging in remote areas. Overall, our results suggest that unsustainable forest use from socialist times likely persisted in the post-socialist period, resulting in a continued loss of older forests and forest fragmentation. Landsat-based forest trends differed substantially from official forest resource statistics. Illegal logging appears to have been at least as extensive as documented logging during the early 1990s and so-called sanitary clear-cuts represent a major loophole for overharvesting and logging in restricted areas. Reforestation and illegal logging are frequently not accounted for in forest resource statistics, highlighting limitations of these data. Combating illegal logging and transitioning towards sustainable forestry requires better monitoring and up-to-date accounting of forest resources, in the Carpathians and elsewhere in Eastern Europe, and remote sensing can be a key technology to achieve these goals.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2009.02.006", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2158854610", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["3077937", "131296264", "40245661", "127163873", "194951", "16701030", "12887360", "33659044", "155096475", "129459788", "84060925", "53124176", "22519235", "129914394", "23382232", "34276500", "27693302", "54653799", "55695956", "129830617", "84103723", "20102533", "17181316", "43391421", "153413036", "52086965", "130921493", "44477434", "52083947", "12553412", "73680039", "154823575", "129803791", "154064732", "51754018", "153465513", "18535574", "154006485", "36935044", "86227819"], "inbound_citations": ["104293308", "165121841", "91027098", "199665628", "59046193", "14581240", "56776", "131286121", "91388729", "6603447", "55251284", "199665830", "4806179", "8642286", "27465054", "12017306", "17711349"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:452466"}

This paper proposes a novel CTC CAD system using 3-D radiomic features that can obtain high detection sensitivity at low FP rate. Our previous shape-based methods are used to generate polyp candidates. Then, a wide variety of radiomic features are developed in the 3-D domain for each initial candidate, including the multiscale Weber local descriptors and the statistical descriptors calculated from various volumetric feature maps on the basis of computed tomography (CT) density, CT gradient, fractal dimension, curvature, and fast radial symmetry transform. These new 3-D radiomic features can characterize polyp candidates in terms of the shape, texture heterogeneity, and salient pattern. FP reduction is finally performed by Random Forests with a developed score rank method to tune the training set. 510 fluid-tagging CT scans from 255 patients with 130 polyps \u22655 mm were utilized to validate the proposed system in the fivefold cross-validation strategy. The detection result reached 98.5% by-polyp sensitivity at 2.0 FPs per scan for polyps \u22655 mm. Experimental results indicate that the proposed system yielded a detection performance with high sensitivity and low FP rate.

In support of this concept, we used meteorological and flux data from the AmeriFlux network and an inductive machine learning technique called support vector machine (SVM) to develop a predictive ET model. The model was then applied to the conterminous U.S. In this process, we first trained the SVM to predict 2000-2002 ET measurements from 25 AmeriFlux sites using three remotely sensed variables [land surface temperature, enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and land cover] and one ground-measured variable (surface shortwave radiation). Second, we evaluated the model performance by predicting ET for 19 flux sites in 2003. In this independent evaluation, the SVM predicted ET with a root-mean-square error (rmse) of 0.62 mm/day (approximately 23% of the mean observed values) and an R2 of 0.75. The rmse from SVM was significantly smaller than that from neural network and multiple-regression approaches in a cross-validation experiment. Among the explanatory variables, EVI was the most important factor. Indeed, removing this variable induced an rmse increase from 0.54 to 0.77 mm/day. Third, with forcings from remote sensing data alone, we used the SVM model to predict the spatial and temporal distributions of ET for the conterminous U.S. for 2004.

We propose a new prediction-based objective function that can be tailored to the requirements of practitioners and can be used to assess and interpret a given problem.

Two applications on cancer data sets and a simulation study show that the proposal compares favorably with competing alternatives such as, for example, Elastic Net and Support Vector Machine.

They have been proven to give highly accurate results in complex classification problems, for example, gene expression analysis.

For many data mining tasks (e.g., cancer prediction) finding classifiers with good predictive accuracy is important, but understanding the classifier is equally important. By studying the classifier outputs we may be able to produce a simpler classifier, learn which variables are the important discriminators between classes, and find the samples that are problematic to the classification. Visual methods for exploratory data analysis can help us to study the outputs and complement automated classification algorithms in data mining. We present the use of tour-based methods to plot aspects of the SVM classifier. This approach provides insights about the cluster structure in the data, the nature of boundaries between clusters, and problematic outliers.

With the advancements in the field of computer vision, many researchers have adopted the image processing technique for the microstructure analysis. Most of the previous methods are not adaptable, non-reproducible, semi-automated, and most importantly all these methods are highly influenced by image magnification. Therefore, to overcome these challenges, this paper presents a machine learning based image segmentation method for microstructure analysis and degree of hydration measurement using SEM images. In addition, the authors looked into the impact of magnification of SEM images on the model accuracy and classifier training for the degree of hydration measurement considering two scenarios. First, the image segmentation was performed using a classifier of specific magnification, and then a common classifier is trained using the image of different magnification. The results show that the Random Forest classifier algorithm is suitable for microstructure analysis using SEM images. Through the statistical analysis, it has been proved that there is no significant effect of magnification on model training and accuracy for the degree of hydration measurement. So, a single classifier can be used to process the images of different magnification of a specimen which reduces the effort of training and computational time. The proposed method can generate highly accurate and reliable results in a shorter time and lower cost. Moreover, the findings in this research can be useful for researchers to determine the optimum magnification required for the microstructure analysis.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.aei.2019.100975", "venue": "Adv.

Unfortunately, the bandwidth-distance product in these schemes is mainly limited by phase noise that comes from the laser linewidth, as well as the chromatic fiber dispersion. On the other hand, the single-hidden layer feedforward neural network subject to the extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm has been widely studied in regression and classification problems for different research fields, because of its good generalization performance and extremely fast learning speed. In this work, ELMs in the real and complex domains for direct-detection OFDM-based RoF schemes are proposed for the first time. These artificial neural networks are based on the use of pilot subcarriers as training samples and data subcarriers as testing samples, and consequently, their learning stages occur in real-time without decreasing the effective transmission rate. Regarding the feasible pilot-assisted equalization method, the effectiveness and simplicity of the ELM algorithm in the complex domain are highlighted by evaluation of a QPSK-OFDM signal over an additive white Gaussian noise channel at diverse laser linewidths and chromatic fiber dispersion effects and taking into account several OFDM symbol periods. Considering diverse relationships between the fiber transmission distance and the radio frequency (for practical design purposes) and the duration of a single OFDM symbol equal to 64 ns, the fully-complex ELM followed by the real ELM outperform the pilot-based correction channel in terms of the system performance tolerance against the signal-to-noise ratio and the laser linewidth.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/electronics8090921", "venue": null, "journal": "Electronics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2969517048", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["43306045", "106534533", "23302597", "60442809", "189817095", "126255616", "42547618", "60778033", "3873544", "16907717", "15977147", "14619623", "12450925", "3652617", "14510390", "12176794", "26874566", "20769016", "122731602", "649506", "29964060", "32258642", "67275644", "53051134", "27049715", "24974299", "33042172", "42488", "24367165", "19567063", "24701148"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202098027"}

One side argues that the success of the GAN training should be attributed to the choice of loss function [16, 2, 5], while the other suggests that the Lipschitz regularization is the key to good results [17, 3, 18, 19]. We provide a theoretical and experimental analysis of how Lipschitz regularization interacts with the loss function to derive the following insights: (i) We show that popular GANs (NS-GAN [4], LS-GAN [16], WGAN [2]) perform equally well when the discriminator is regularized with a small Lipschitz constant, but the performance in terms of quality and diversity gets worse for larger Lipschitz constants, except for WGAN. (ii) We show that all loss functions degenerate to linear ones for small Lipschitz constants to explain why the performance of these GANs is similar. For higher Lipschitz constants, we observe that only WGAN performs well while NS-GAN and LS-GAN break down. For lower Lipschitz constants, NS-GAN and LS-GAN perform similarly to WGAN only because they degenerate to the WGAN loss. In order to further illustrate this issue, we demonstrate that even \"ridiculous\" loss functions such as sin and exp have similar performance to NS-GAN, LS-GAN, and WGAN, when small Lipschitz constants are used.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1811.09567", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "mag_id": "2901775961", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["195821312", "174798336"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53720688"}

Several data mining techniques have been introduced to improve the classification mechanism of Intrusion detection system.

It has a wide variety of real-world applications, e.g., automatic image annotations and gene function analysis. Current research on multilabel classification focuses on supervised settings which assume existence of large amounts of labeled training data. However, in many applications, the labeling of multilabeled data is extremely expensive and time consuming, while there are often abundant unlabeled data available. In this paper, we study the problem of transductive multilabel learning and propose a novel solution, called Trasductive Multilabel Classification (TraM), to effectively assign a set of multiple labels to each instance. Different from supervised multilabel learning methods, we estimate the label sets of the unlabeled instances effectively by utilizing the information from both labeled and unlabeled data. We first formulate the transductive multilabel learning as an optimization problem of estimating label concept compositions. Then, we derive a closed-form solution to this optimization problem and propose an effective algorithm to assign label sets to the unlabeled instances.

Parameterized Appearance Models (PAMs) such as the Lucas-Kanade method, Eigentracking, and Active Appearance Models are commonly used to align images with respect to a template or to a previously learned model. While PAMs have numerous advantages relative to alternate approaches, they have at least two drawbacks. First, they are especially prone to local minima in the registration process. Second, often few, if any, of the local minima of the cost function correspond to acceptable solutions. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a method to learn a metric for PAMs that explicitly optimizes that local minima occur at and only at the places corresponding to the correct fitting parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to address the problem of learning a metric to explicitly model local properties of the PAMs' error surface.

In modified ST, a single signal-dependent window is introduced, with optimally selected window parameters via energy concentration maximization based constraint optimization. As a result of which accurate time-frequency localization of various PQ events is achieved, with sharper energy concentration. In classification stage, the proposed PQ framework utilizes the RF-based classifier, which follows the bagging approach by random selection of features and data points, at each node, to train the classifier. Decision stumps are used as weak classifiers, and using a simple majority voting of these decision stumps, RF builds a strong classifier. The RF gives less variance and less bias estimation due to injection of randomness into the training phase, and its performance is found to be reasonably immune to input parameter selection. As a result of this, the classification results of the proposed PQ framework are found to be very accurate and quite insensitive to the presence of noise in the data.

During last few years lot of work has been done in the field of computer assisted analysis to detect an epileptic activity in an EEG. Still there is a significant amount of need to make these computer assisted EEG analysis systems more convenient and informative for a neurologist. After briefly discussing some of the existing work we have suggested an approach which can make these systems more helpful, detailed and precise for the neurologist. In our proposed approach we have handled each epoch of each channel for each type of epileptic pattern exclusive to each other. In our approach feature extraction starts with an application of multilevel Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) on each 1 sec non-overlapping epochs. Then we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the effect of redundant and noisy data. Afterwards we apply Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify these epochs as Epileptic or not. In our system a user can mark any mistakes he encounters. The concept behind the inclusion of the retraining is that, if there is more than one example with same attributes but different labels, the classifier is going to get trained to the one with most population. These corrective marking will be saved as examples. On retraining the classifier will improve its classification, hence it will tries to adapt the user. In the end we have discussed the results we have acquired till now. Due to limitation in the available data we are only able to report the classification performance for generalised absence seizure. The reported accuracy is resulted on very versatile dataset of 21 patients from Punjab Institute of Mental Health (PIMH) and 21 patients from Children Hospital Boston (CHB) which have different number of channel and sampling frequency.

The problem has been approached in the context of machine learning. However, the proposed method in this paper is different from other learning based methods regarding how the input/output are formulated as well as how the learning is done. The assumption behind example based methods is the local similarity across seemingly different images. The assumption is illustrated by examples of image coding. Because of the differences in formulating the input/output and the implementation of Support Vector Regression (SVR), it is shown that the proposed approach outperforms the competing SVR method and the kernel regression method in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), objective measurements of image quality. Since example based approaches are based on training, in which we know exactly what the output shall be.

In the present study, we show that DM can make a great contribution in solving complex problems in civil engineering, namely in the field of geotechnical engineering. Particularly, the high learning capabilities of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) algorithm, characterized by it flexibility and non-linear capabilities, were applied in the prediction of the Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS) of Jet Grouting (JG) samples directly extracted from JG columns, usually known as soilcrete . JG technology is a soft-soil improvement method worldwide applied, extremely versatile and economically attractive when compared with other methods. However, even after many years of experience still lacks of accurate methods for JG columns design. Accordingly, in the present paper a novel approach (based on SVM algorithm) for UCS prediction of soilcrete mixtures is proposed supported on 472 results collected from different geotechnical works. Furthermore, a global sensitivity analysis is applied in order to explain and extract understandable knowledge from the proposed model. Such analysis allows one to identify the key variables in UCS prediction and to measure its effect.

Multiple non-linear parameters and dynamic factors, such as Dead Zone, Saturation, Coulomb Friction, Backlash and load changes, are of most concern when controlling servomotors' angular position. Due to these nonlinearities and dynamic factors, conventional control schemes such as PID control may not be the best solution for some applications because they result in low system efficiency.

At higher scales in the image, this representation yields an oversimplified model since multiple classes can be reasonably expected to appear within large regions. This simplified model particularly lim- its the impact of information at higher scales. Since class- label information at these scales is usually more reliable than at lower, noisier scales, neglecting this information is undesirable. To address these issues, we propose a new con- sistency potential for image labeling problems, which we call the harmony potential.

Further, a potential weakness in GANs is that discriminator DNNs typically provide only one value (loss) of corrective feedback to generator DNNs (namely, the discriminator's assessment of the generated example). By contrast, we propose a new class of GAN we refer to as LogicGAN, that leverages recent advances in (logic-based) explainable AI (xAI) systems to provide a\"richer\"form of corrective feedback from discriminators to generators. Specifically, we modify the gradient descent process using xAI systems that specify the reason as to why the discriminator made the classification it did, thus providing the richer corrective feedback that helps the generator to better fool the discriminator. Using our approach, we show that LogicGANs learn much faster on MNIST data, achieving an improvement in data efficiency of 45% in single and 12.73% in multi-class setting over standard GANs while maintaining the same quality as measured by Fr\\'echet Inception Distance.

The character is then decomposed into many meaningful sub-structures. Every substructure is a radical actually and is divided into 8 subareas for each of four directions so that the statistics feature of number of pixels in each subarea is adapted to recognize radical using SVM. Since Chinese character is composed of radicals, the recognition of Chinese character is transformed to series of radical matching between the input character and reference pattern. Furthermore, a character could have front radical and rear radical, so the front or rear radical is utilized in coarse classification stage to reduce the number of candidate characters. In respect that only radicals' feature and the radical string for a character is needed to be recorded, the template file size can be largely reduced, the speed of recognition is improved greatly.

At last, a reflector and a pair of top-facing \u03c0-shape parasitic patches are applied to the antenna to increase the gain and decrease the voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) at 1.7GHz.

However, some of the most popular CNN architectures for image segmentation still rely on post-processing strategies (e.g. Conditional Random Fields) to incorporate connectivity constraints into the resulting masks. These post-processing steps are based on the assumption that objects are usually continuous and therefore nearby pixels should be assigned the same object label. Even if it is a valid assumption in general, these methods do not offer a straightforward way to incorporate more complex priors like convexity or arbitrary shape restrictions. In this work we propose Post-DAE, a post-processing method based on denoising autoencoders (DAE) trained using only segmentation masks. We learn a low-dimensional space of anatomically plausible segmentations, and use it as a post-processing step to impose shape constraints on the resulting masks obtained with arbitrary segmentation methods. Our approach is independent of image modality and intensity information since it employs only segmentation masks for training. This enables the use of anatomical segmentations that do not need to be paired with intensity images, making the approach very flexible. Our experimental results on anatomical segmentation of X-ray images show that Post-DAE can improve the quality of noisy and incorrect segmentation masks obtained with a variety of standard methods, by bringing them back to a feasible space, with almost no extra computational time.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1906.02343", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-32226-7_65", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2979553087,2948450552", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["3719281", "148067", "2938537", "6063320", "89141", "206750461", "34468396", "17804904", "206429151", "5574079", "206786900"], "inbound_citations": ["204402643", "215548377", "210868287", "210839656"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:174804285"}

The problem is non trivial if the agent runs on a limited computational budget and has a bounded memory of past data. In a deep learning approach, the constant computational budget requires the use of a fixed architecture for all incremental states. The bounded memory generates data imbalance in favor of new classes and a prediction bias toward them appears. This bias is commonly countered by introducing a data balancing step in addition to the basic network training. We depart from this approach and propose simple but efficient scaling of past class classifier weights to make them more comparable to those of new classes. Scaling exploits incremental state level statistics and is applied to the classifiers learned in the initial state of classes in order to profit from all their available data. We also question the utility of the widely used distillation loss component of incremental learning algorithms by comparing it to vanilla fine tuning in presence of a bounded memory.

Object-based image analysis can be a time consuming task in extracting information from large images because most of the segmentation algorithms use the pixel-grid for the initial object representation. It would be more natural and efficient to work with perceptually meaningful entities that are derived from pixels using a low-level grouping process (superpixels). Firstly, we tested a new workflow for image segmentation of remote sensing data, starting the multiresolution segmentation (MRS, using ESP2 tool) from the superpixel level and aiming at reducing the amount of time needed to automatically partition relatively large datasets of very high resolution remote sensing data. Secondly, we examined whether a Random Forest classification based on an oversegmentation produced by a Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) superpixel algorithm performs similarly with reference to a traditional object-based classification regarding accuracy. Tests were applied on QuickBird and WorldView-2 data with different extents, scene content complexities, and number of bands to assess how the computational time and classification accuracy are affected by these factors. The proposed segmentation approach is compared with the traditional one, starting the MRS from the pixel level, regarding geometric accuracy of the objects and the computational time. The computational time was reduced in all cases, the biggest improvement being from 5 h 35 min to 13 min, for a WorldView-2 scene with eight bands and an extent of 12.2 million pixels, while the geometric accuracy is kept similar or slightly better. SLIC superpixel-based classification had similar or better overall accuracy values when compared to MRS-based classification, but the results were obtained in a fast manner and avoiding the parameterization of the MRS.

The key issue is how to bridge user features between the targeted site and the auxiliary site. In traditional transfer learning models, a linear mapping function is assumed to map the user feature in the auxiliary site into the targeted site. The limitation lies in that when the real data does not follow the linear property, such models will fail to work. Therefore, the motivation of this paper is to identify whether the rating prediction performance in recommender systems can be improved by considering the nonlinear transformation. As a primary study, we propose a nonlinear transfer learning model, and utilize the radial basis function (RBF) kernel to map user features of multiple sites. Through empirical analysis in a real-world cross-site dataset, we demonstrate that by utilizing the nonlinear mapping function RBF kernel, the rating prediction performance is consistently better than previous transfer learning models at a significant scale.

The central thesis is that much of the knowledge about the planning process itself can be formulated in terms of higher-level goals and plans called meta-goals and meta-plans. These entities can then be used by the same understanding and planning mechanisms that process ordinary goals and plans. However, the meta-planning knowledge now enables these mechanisms to handle much more complicated situations in a uniform manner. Systems based on meta-planning would have a number of advantages over existing problem solving and understanding systems. The same knowledge could be shared by both a planner and understander, and both would be able to handle complex situations elegantly. In addition, in planning, the use of metaplanning has several advantages over more traditional methods involving constraints or critics. Meta-planning allows the full power of a problem solver to be applied to situations that are generally amenable only to special purpose processing. In addition, meta-planning facilitates the representation of some situations that are difficult to express otherwise.

We measured prediction accuracy as the correlation between actual and predicted phenotypes in a five-fold cross-validation setting. Phenotypic traits measured included live weight measures and carcass composition obtained during the trial as well as at slaughter. We employed a null model excluding microbiome information as a baseline to assess the increase in prediction accuracy stemming from the inclusion of operational taxonomic units (OTU) as predictors. We further contrasted performance of models from the Bayesian alphabet (Bayesian Lasso) as well machine learning approaches (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) and semi-parametric kernel models (Reproducing Kernel Hilbert space). In most cases, prediction accuracy increased significantly with the inclusion of microbiome data. Accuracy was more substantial with the inclusion of metagenomic information taken at week 15 and 22, with values ranging from approximately 0.30 for loin traits to more than 0.50 for back-fat. Conversely, microbiome composition at weaning resulted in most cases in marginal gains of prediction accuracy, suggesting that later measures might be more useful to include in predictive models. Model choice affected predictions marginally with no clear winner for any model/trait/time point. We, therefore, suggest average prediction across models as a robust strategy in fitting metagenomic information. In conclusion, microbiome composition can effectively be used as a predictor of growth and composition traits, particularly for fatness traits. The inclusion of OTU predictors could potentially be used to promote fast growth of individuals while limiting fat accumulation.

Remote Sensing 2012", "authors": [{"first": "Prasad S.", "middle": [], "last": "Thenkabail", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Zhuoting", "middle": [], "last": "Wu", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "The overarching goal of this research was to develop and demonstrate an automated Cropland Classification Algorithm (ACCA) that will rapidly, routinely, and accurately classify agricultural cropland extent, areas, and characteristics (e.g., irrigated vs. rainfed) over large areas such as a country or a region through combination of multi-sensor remote sensing and secondary data. In this research, a rule-based ACCA was conceptualized, developed, and demonstrated for the country of Tajikistan using mega file data cubes (MFDCs) involving data from Landsat Global Land Survey (GLS), Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) 30 m, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 m time-series, a suite of secondary data (e.g., elevation, slope, precipitation, temperature), and in situ data. First, the process involved producing an accurate reference (or truth) cropland layer (TCL), consisting of cropland extent, areas, and irrigated vs. rainfed cropland areas, for the entire country of Tajikistan based on MFDC of year 2005 (MFDC2005). The methods involved in producing TCL included using ISOCLASS clustering, Tasseled Cap bi-spectral plots, spectro-temporal characteristics from MODIS 250 m monthly normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) maximum value composites (MVC) time-series, and textural characteristics of higher resolution imagery. The TCL statistics accurately matched with the national statistics of Tajikistan for irrigated and rainfed croplands, where about 70% of croplands were irrigated and the rest rainfed. Second, a rule-based ACCA was developed to replicate the TCL accurately (~80% producer\u2019s and user\u2019s accuracies or within 20% quantity disagreement involving about 10 million Landsat 30 m sized cropland pixels of Tajikistan). Development of ACCA was an iterative process involving series of rules that are coded, refined, tweaked, and re-coded till ACCA derived croplands (ACLs) match accurately with TCLs. Third, the ACCA derived cropland layers of Tajikistan were produced for year 2005 (ACL2005), same year as the year used for developing ACCA, using MFDC2005. Fourth, TCL for year 2010 (TCL2010), an independent year, was produced using MFDC2010 using the same methods and approaches as the one used to produce TCL2005. Fifth, the ACCA was applied on MFDC2010 to derive ACL2010. The ACLs were then compared with TCLs (ACL2005 vs. TCL2005 and ACL2010 vs. TCL2010). The resulting accuracies and errors from error matrices involving about 152 million Landsat (30 m) pixels of the country of Tajikistan (of which about 10 million Landsat size, 30 m, cropland pixels) showed an overall accuracy of 99.6% (khat = 0.97) for ACL2005 vs. TCL2005. For the 3 classes (irrigated, rainfed, and others) mapped in ACL2005, the producer\u2019s accuracy was >86.4% and users accuracy was >93.6%. For ACL2010 vs. TCL2010, the error matrix showed an overall accuracy on 96.2% (khat = 0.96). For the 3 classes (irrigated, rainfed, and others) mapped in ACL2010, the producer\u2019s and user\u2019s accuracies for the irrigated areas were \u226582.9%. Any intermixing was overwhelmingly between irrigated and rainfed croplands, indicating that croplands (irrigated plus rainfed areas) as well as irrigated areas were mapped with high levels of accuracies (~90% or higher) even for the independent year. The ACL2005 and ACL2010, each, were produced using ACCA algorithm in ~30 min using a Dell Precision desktop T7400 computer for the entire country of Tajikistan once the MFDCs for the years were ready. The ACCA algorithm for Tajikistan is made available through US Geological Survey\u2019s ScienceBase: http://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/folder/4f79f1b7e4b0009bd827f548 or at: https://powellcenter.usgs.gov/globalcroplandwater/content/models-algorithms. The research contributes to the efforts of global food security through research on global croplands and their water use (e.g., https://powellcenter.usgs.gov/globalcroplandwater/). The above results clearly demonstrated the ability of a rule-based ACCA to rapidly and accurately produce cropland data layer year after year (hindcast, nowcast, forecast) for the country it was developed using MFDCs that consist of combining multiple sensor data and secondary data. It needs to be noted that the ACCA is applicable to the area (e.g., country, region) for which it is developed. In this case, ACCA is applicable for the Country of Tajikistan to hindcast, nowcast, and forecast agricultural cropland extent, areas, and irrigated vs. rainfed. The same fundamental concept of ACCA applies to other areas of the World where ACCA codes need to be modified to suite the area/region of interest. ACCA can also be expanded to compute other crop characteristics such as crop types, cropping intensities, and phenologies.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/rs4102890", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": "Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2058208710", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["131071729", "5496119", "18402956", "55225191", "56040665", "16171945", "17028768", "128567102", "16244918", "122706523", "128527810", "140202254", "17398081", "62152803", "38982302", "53127857", "10365137", "29632779", "127195275", "86219373", "129086336", "15668839", "30240650", "111306363", "205300792", "128550727", "14911714", "62883674", "9880629", "2558803", "16597488", "49531176", "120025783", "33836185", "128773930", "128892277", "128460031", "21736185", "60985554"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:27908121"}

XERIC networks, presented here, are distributed representation connectionist parsers which can analyze and represent syntactically varied sentences, including ones with recursive phrase structure constructs. No a priori limits are placed on the depth or length of sentences by the architecture. XERIC networks use recurrent networks to read words one at a time. RAAM style reduced descriptions and X-Bar grammar are used to make an economical syntactic representation scheme. This is combined with a training technique which allows XERIC to use multiple, virtual copies of its RAAM decoder network to learn to parse and represent sentence structure using gradient-descent methods.

The high resolution data of Worldveiw-2 having spatial resolution of 0.4 m is used for landslide inventory. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was used for landslide inventory developing. Total 51460 number of landslides were classified using semi-automatic technique with covering area of 265 Km2, smallest landslide mapped is covering area of 2.01 m2 and the maximum covered area of single landslide is 3.01 Km2. Nine influential causative factors are used for landslide susceptibility mapping. Those causative factors include slope, aspect, profile curvature, elevation, distance from fault lines, distance from streams and geology. Logistic regression model was used for the Landslides susceptibility modelling. From model the highest coefficient was assigned to geology which shows that the geology has higher influence in the area. For landslide susceptibility mapping the 70 % of the data was used and 30% is used for the validation of the model. The prediction accuracy of the model in this study is 92 % using validation data.

Documents are typically represented by sparse vectors under the vector space model, where each word in the vocabulary is mapped to one coordinate axis and its occurrence in the document gives rise to one nonzero component in the vector representing that document. When training classifiers on large collections of documents, both the time and memory requirements connected with processing of these vectors may be prohibitive. This calls for using a feature selection method, not only to reduce the number of features but also to increase the sparsity of document vectors. We propose a feature selection method based on linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs). First, we train the linear SVM on a subset of training data and retain only those features that correspond to highly weighted components (in absolute value sense) of the normal to the resulting hyperplane that separates positive and negative examples. This reduced feature space is then used to train a classifier over a larger training set because more documents now fit into the same amount of memory. In our experiments we compare the effectiveness of the SVM -based feature selection with that of more traditional feature selection methods, such as odds ratio and information gain, in achieving the desired tradeoff between the vector sparsity and the classification performance. Experimental results indicate that, at the same level of vector sparsity, feature selection based on SVM normals yields better classification performance than odds ratioor information gainbased feature selection when linear SVM classifiers are used.", "year": 2002, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2495/DATA020271", "venue": "In Proc. of the 3rd Int.

As a result, the quality of life of refractory epilepsy patients could be improved. Most state-of-the-art algorithms for heart rate-based seizure detection use a so-called patient-independent approach, which do not take into account patient-specific data during algorithm training. Although such systems are easy to use in practice, they lead to many false detections as the ictal heart rate changes are patient-dependent. In practice, only a limited amount of accurately annotated patient data is typically available, which makes it difficult to create fully patient-specific algorithms. Methods: In this context, this study proposes for the first time a new transfer learning approach that allows to personalize heart rate-based seizure detection by using only a couple of days of data per patient. The algorithm was evaluated on 2,172 h of single-lead ECG data from 24 temporal lobe epilepsy patients including 227 focal impaired awareness seizures. Results: The proposed personalized approach resulted in an overall sensitivity of 71% with 1.9 false detections per hour. This is an average decrease in false detection rate of 37% compared to the reference patient-independent algorithm using only a limited amount of personal seizure data. The proposed transfer learning approach adapts faster and more robustly to patient-specific characteristics than other alternatives for personalization in the literature.

We present a procedure to classify real world scenes in eight semantic groups of coast, forest, mountain, open country, street, tall building, highway and inside city using support vector machines. Traditional classification approaches generalize poorly on image classification tasks, when the classes are non-separable. In this paper we used Support Vector Machine (SVM) for scene classification. SVM is a supervised classification technique, has its roots in Statistical Learning Theory and have gained prominence because they are robust, accurate and are effective even when using a small training sample. By their nature SVMs are essentially binary classifiers, however, they can be adapted to handle the multiple classification tasks common in scene classification. This paper shows that support vector machines (SVM's) can generalize well on difficult scene classification problems. SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces. In this paper 4 types of kernels (linear, polynomial, gaussian and sigmoidal kernels) are used with support vector machines. It is observed that Gaussian kernel outperform other types of kernels.

We propose to constrain the learned metric to be invariant to the geometry preserving transformations of images that induce permutations in the feature space. The constraint that these transformations are isometries of the metric ensures consistent results and improves accuracy.

In this paper, we propose to combine distant supervision with minimal human supervision by annotating features (in particular shortest dependency paths) rather than complete relation instances. Such feature labeling eliminates noise from the initial training set, resulting in a significant increase of precision at the expense of recall. We further improve on this approach by introducing the Semantic Label Propagation (SLP) method, which uses the similarity between low-dimensional representations of candidate training instances to again extend the (filtered) training set in order to increase recall while maintaining high precision.

This study describes the implementation of a sequence-based classifier, denoted as NClassG+, for identifying non-classically secreted Gram-positive bacterial proteins.ResultsSeveral feature-based classifiers were trained using different sequence transformation vectors (frequencies, dipeptides, physicochemical factors and PSSM) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with Linear, Polynomial and Gaussian kernel functions. Nested k-fold cross-validation (CV) was applied to select the best models, using the inner CV loop to tune the model parameters and the outer CV group to compute the error. The parameters and Kernel functions and the combinations between all possible feature vectors were optimized using grid search.ConclusionsThe final model was tested against an independent set not previously seen by the model, obtaining better predictive performance compared to SecretomeP V2.0 and SecretPV2.0 for the identification of non-classically secreted proteins.

More than 600 different PAs are known. PAs are ester alkaloids composed of a necine base and a necic acid, which can be used to divide PAs in different structural subcategories. The main target organs for PA metabolism and toxicity are liver and lungs. Additionally, PAs are potentially genotoxic, carcinogenic and exhibit developmental toxicity. Only for very few PAs, in vitro and in vivo investigations have characterized their toxic potential. However, these investigations suggest that structural differences have an influence on the toxicity of single PAs. To investigate this structural relationship for a large number of PAs, a quantitative structural-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis for hepatotoxicity of over 600 different PAs was performed, using Random Forest- and artificial Neural Networks-algorithms. These models were trained with a recently established dataset specific for acute hepatotoxicity in humans. Using this dataset, a set of molecular predictors was identified to predict the hepatotoxic potential of each compound in validated QSAR models. Based on these models, the hepatotoxic potential of the 602 PAs was predicted and the following hepatotoxic rank order in 3 main categories defined (1) for necine base: otonecine > retronecine > platynecine; (2) for necine base modification: dehydropyrrolizidine \u226b tertiary PA = N-oxide; and (3) for necic acid: macrocyclic diester \u2265 open-ring diester > monoester.

It is of specific features such as ultra-thick workpiece cutting and reuse of wire electrode. While cutting variable height workpieces with constant machining parameters, this type of WEDM faces the same challenges as western style WEDM, either the risk of wire breakage or the low cutting speed. Due to the intermittent discharge process and the varying machining characteristics, online estimation of workpiece height becomes even more difficult for this type of WEDM. This paper proposes a method of online workpiece height estimation based on support vector machine (SVM), an effective machine learning method. The inputs of the SVM model are effective discharge frequency, pulse interval, programmed feed rate and actual feed rate and the output is the estimated height. The algorithm is integrated in a newly developed computer numerical control (CNC) system for reciprocated traveling WEDM, with a sampling circuit collecting current and voltage signals from the discharge gap and an adaptive control unit which adjusts the machining parameters according to the workpiece height estimation. The data for training the SVM were produced by cutting stair-shaped workpieces to build the SVM model. Then verification was carried out by cutting through workpieces with variable height cross sections. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. The estimation error was less than 2 mm and the machining time was reduced by more than 30%.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.procir.2017.12.034", "venue": null, "journal": "Procedia CIRP", "mag_id": "2800128395", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["52944571"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:196000100"}

The advances in technology and system information have significantly increased fraud activities, which can have negative impacts on revenue gains and services quality.

Our study was one of the first to suggest the possibility of using non-medical training, using transfer learning from the general imagery to the medical domain. In this chapter we explore deep features that are extracted from intermediate CNN layers in comparison to a set of classical shallow features, including GLCM, PHOG, GABOR, GIST and the more recent, state-of-the-art BoVW model. We investigate the possible benefits of using feature selection techniques on the Deep CNN feature layers. Average AUC results of close to 90% are shown for categorization of 6 different pathologies in a dataset of more than 600 radiographs. This study shows the strength and robustness of the CNN features. We conclude that deep learning with large scale non-medical image databases may be a good substitute, or addition, to domain specific representations which are yet to be available for general medical image recognition tasks.

The current study extends beyond these recent research frameworks and into another important inquiry area addressing the impacts of internal parameterization on the performance of support vector machines for land-cover classification. A set of support vector machines with different combinations of kernel types, parameters, and error penalty are carefully constructed to classify a Landsat Thematic Mapper image into eight major land-cover categories using identical training data. The accuracy of each classified map is further evaluated using identical reference data. The results reveal that kernel types and error penalty can substantially affect the classification accuracy, and that a careful selection of parameter settings can help improve the performance of the support vector classification.

Using 40 fluoroquinolones as reference molecules, a data set of 4000 natural products was screened that bore structural similarities with fluoroquinolone. From this data set, Random Forest classifier was used to predict active natural compounds that may have an inhibitory effect against HCV NS3 activity. This Random Forest classifier builds a set of decision trees by using a set of 0D, 1D, 2D, 3D and others, total 2080 molecular descriptors, of the two data sets i.e., the training and testing set. Compounds with RF score >0.5 are classified as an active compound against HCV. Using this approach, out of 4000 test molecules, 147 molecules were predicted to be active against HCV NS3 helicase. These predicted active compounds can be analyzed further using in silico and in vitro experimental models to discover an effective drug against HCV. The above-described approach is useful in discovering new, more portent and affordable drugs for treating HCV infection.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4172/2153-0602.C1.003", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Data Mining in Genomics & Proteomics", "mag_id": "2551040209", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:115902714"}

Classically, tasks in natural language processing have been performed through rule-based and statistical methodologies. However, owing to the vast nature of natural languages these methods do not generalise well and failed to learn the nuances of language. Thus machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes and decision trees coupled with traditional models such as Bag-of-Words and N-grams were used to usurp this problem. Eventually, with the advent of advanced recurrent neural network architectures such as the LSTM, we were able to achieve state-of-the-art performance in several natural language processing tasks such as text classification and machine translation. We talk about how Transfer Learning has brought about the well-known ImageNet moment for NLP. Several advanced architectures such as the Transformer and its variants have allowed practitioners to leverage knowledge gained from unrelated task to drastically fasten convergence and provide better performance on the target task.

A simple skin test is the most generally utilized diagnostic equipment for TB, though blood tests are becoming more common. A small quantity of a substance termed PPD (Post-Partum Depression) tuberculin is injected below the skin of one\u2019s inside forearm. Sometimes, false negative treatment may also results. Thus several upcoming techniques are introduced to cure the TB. It is based upon the CAD system that deals with the problem of TB detection on CXR. It is maintained by the training dataset. The drawback that occurs on the previous model is that its inherent features are uncertain. The novel 3 methods implemented in this research are i) Lung Segment, ii) Texture Feature Extraction as well as iii) Pixel classification. Along with these, miSVM+PEDD (multiple instances Support Vector Machine + Probability Estimation and Data Discarding) is used for the segmentation process. Thus the model should be evaluated by implementing some recent features of the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL). The Improved Algorithm is deployed by training a MIL classifier which builds from other machine learning (ML), Active Learning (AL) and 1-class classification approaches. Here, the uncertainty intrinsic to a MIL pixel classifier is diminished while minimizing the labeling exertions. The uses of AL are centered on the image and text categorization. The resulting lung likelihood map is post-processed to obtain binary segmentation. Here, the MIL is integrated with the AL Model.

The PGT is obtained by propagating the labels of a GT frame to its subsequent frames in the video using a simple CRF-based, cue integration framework. Our main contribution is to demonstrate the use of noisy PGT along with GT to improve the performance of a CNN. We perform a systematic analysis to find the right kind of PGT that needs to be added along with the GT for training a CNN. In this regard, we explore three aspects of PGT which influence the learning of a CNN: (i) the PGT labeling has to be of good quality; (ii) the PGT images have to be different compared to the GT images; (iii) the PGT has to be trusted differently than GT. We conclude that PGT which is diverse from GT images and has good quality of labeling can indeed help improve the performance of a CNN. Also, when PGT is multiple folds larger than GT, weighing down the trust on PGT helps in improving the accuracy. Finally, We show that using PGT along with GT, the performance of Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) on Camvid data is increased by \\(2.7\\,\\%\\) on IoU accuracy.

Notably, including additional fully-connected layers further increases the predictive power of the networks by up to 10%. Analysis of the predictions generated by RF models and ConvNets shows that by simply averaging the output of the RF models and ConvNets we constantly obtain significantly lower errors in prediction (4-12% decrease in RMSE on the test set) than those obtained with either model alone, indicating that the features extracted by the convolutional layers of the ConvNets provide complementary predictive signal to Morgan fingerprints. Overall, in this work we present a set of ConvNet architectures for the prediction of compound activity from their Kekul\\'e structure representations with state-of-the-art performance, that require no generation of compound descriptors or use of sophisticated image processing techniques. ::: The data sets and the code used are provided at this https URL", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "arXiv: Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "mag_id": "2901941515", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["119285364"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208030247"}

In the literature, there is a lack of information on Gram-positive bacterial promoter sequences compared to Gram-negative bacteria. Promoter sequence identification is essential for studying gene expression. Initially, we collected the B. subtilis genome sequence from the NCBI database, and promoters were identified by their sigma factors in the DBTBS database. We then grouped the promoters according to 15 factors in 2 domains, corresponding to sigma 54 and sigma 70 of Gram-negative bacteria. Based on these data we developed a script in Python to search for promoters in the B. subtilis genome. After processing the data, we obtained 767 promoter sequences for B. subtilis, most of which were recognized by sigma SigA. To validate the data we found, we developed a software package called BacSVM+, which receives promoters as input and returns the best combination of parameters in a LibSVM library to predict promoter regions in the bacteria used in the simulation.

Although large amount of PPIs data for different species has been generated by high-throughput experimental techniques, current PPI pairs obtained with experimental methods cover only a fraction of the complete PPI networks, and further, the experimental methods for identifying PPIs are both time-consuming and expensive. Hence, it is urgent and challenging to develop automated computational methods to efficiently and accurately predict PPIs.ResultsWe present here a novel hierarchical PCA-EELM (principal component analysis-ensemble extreme learning machine) model to predict protein-protein interactions only using the information of protein sequences. In the proposed method, 11188 protein pairs retrieved from the DIP database were encoded into feature vectors by using four kinds of protein sequences information. Focusing on dimension reduction, an effective feature extraction method PCA was then employed to construct the most discriminative new feature set. Finally, multiple extreme learning machines were trained and then aggregated into a consensus classifier by majority voting. The ensembling of extreme learning machine removes the dependence of results on initial random weights and improves the prediction performance.ConclusionsWhen performed on the PPI data of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the proposed method achieved 87.00% prediction accuracy with 86.15% sensitivity at the precision of 87.59%. Extensive experiments are performed to compare our method with state-of-the-art techniques Support Vector Machine (SVM). Experimental results demonstrate that proposed PCA-EELM outperforms the SVM method by 5-fold cross-validation. Besides, PCA-EELM performs faster than PCA-SVM based method.

While automatic content generation has played a fundamental challenge to multimedia community for decades, recent advances of deep learning have made this problem feasible. For example, the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is a rewarding approach to synthesize images. Nevertheless, it is not trivial when capitalizing on GANs to generate videos. The difficulty originates from the intrinsic structure where a video is a sequence of visually coherent and semantically dependent frames. This motivates us to explore semantic and temporal coherence in designing GANs to generate videos. In this paper, we present a novel Temporal GANs conditioning on Captions, namely TGANs-C, in which the input to the generator network is a concatenation of a latent noise vector and caption embedding, and then is transformed into a frame sequence with 3D spatio-temporal convolutions. Unlike the naive discriminator which only judges pairs as fake or real, our discriminator additionally notes whether the video matches the correct caption. In particular, the discriminator network consists of three discriminators: video discriminator classifying realistic videos from generated ones and optimizes video-caption matching, frame discriminator discriminating between real and fake frames and aligning frames with the conditioning caption, and motion discriminator emphasizing the philosophy that the adjacent frames in the generated videos should be smoothly connected as in real ones. We qualitatively demonstrate the capability of our TGANs-C to generate plausible videos conditioning on the given captions on two synthetic datasets (SBMG and TBMG) and one real-world dataset (MSVD). Moreover, quantitative experiments on MSVD are performed to validate our proposal via Generative Adversarial Metric and human study.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1804.08264", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3123266.3127905", "venue": "MM '17", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2951212507,2765512343,2964033924", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["8993325", "215717103", "7138078", "1282515", "1033682", "11418612", "1915014", "6281601", "1930231", "14542261", "9996719", "1883779", "1099052", "14432549", "206594905", "11758569", "1563370", "18375389", "6352419", "11699847", "1122604", "214805544", "206594535", "6153535", "1868294"], "inbound_citations": ["207847228", "209500707", "211677591", "29162977", "4475365", "54445210", "189928585", "208208192", "102354021", "59337444", "5085047", "49557393", "168170034", "204800066", "204837030", "204836918", "204837199", "168169988", "201666368", "203633134"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5039505"}

Initially, the training is classification-oriented to encourage the trees to select discriminative features from overlapping mixtures to separate positive audio segments from the negative ones.

Therefore, the training set is changed and then the next training result will be affected. With the increase of the number of the attack vectors which are injected into the positive space, the hyperplane moves to the side of the negative space, and the detection effect of the FDI detector based on SVM is reduced.

This research investigates the benefits of combining these techniques to identify individual tree species. A QuickBird image and low point density LiDAR data for a coastal region in New Zealand was used to examine the possibility of mapping Pohutukawa trees which are regarded as an iconic tree in New Zealand. The study area included a mix of buildings and vegetation types. After image and LiDAR preparation, single tree objects were identified using a range of techniques including: a threshold of above ground height to eliminate ground based objects; Normalised Difference Vegetation Index and elevation difference between the first and last return of LiDAR data to distinguish vegetation from buildings; geometric information to separate clusters of trees from single trees, and treetop identification and region growing techniques to separate tree clusters into single tree crowns. Important feature variables were identified using Random Forest, and the Support Vector Machine provided the classification. The combined techniques using LiDAR and spectral data produced an overall accuracy of 85.4% (Kappa 80.6%). Classification using just the spectral data produced an overall accuracy of 75.8% (Kappa 67.8%).

We demonstrate that a multi-scale hierarchical organization of VQ-VAE, augmented with powerful priors over the latent codes, is able to generate samples with quality that rivals that of state of the art Generative Adversarial Networks on multifaceted datasets such as ImageNet, while not suffering from GAN's known shortcomings such as mode collapse and lack of diversity.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1906.00446", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2971074500,2947590261", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["53018855", "38384342", "53080148", "52889459", "6199526", "13995862", "75135033", "1033682", "326772", "211022860", "211022860", "49657329", "31682332", "118648975", "13975441", "211227", "54458552", "6254678", "160025533", "166228599", "8525940", "12554042", "16895865", "44104089", "1687220", "1687220", "10756563", "2865509", "8142135", "8142135", "20282961", "13756489", "7051992", "206770979"], "inbound_citations": ["215416299", "208158188", "211532737", "210164593", "209414803", "211817834", "211069520", "212717764", "202538965", "211258728", "208309896", "211117443", "202538090", "209377045", "214667531", "211171717", "207870083", "211988374", "211989317", "209352625", "208010442", "207902302", "209444272", "212737075", "208202182", "207881148", "203736873", "203836913", "211296294", "213175447", "211096800"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:173990382"}

In DELM, the margins between different classes are enlarged as much as possible through a technique called e-dragging. DELM is further extended to pruning DELM (P-DELM) using L2,1-norm regularization. The performance of DELM is compared with several state-of-the-art methods on public face databases. The simulation results show the effectiveness of DELM for face recognition when there are posture, facial expression, and illumination variations. P-DELM can distinguish the importance of different hidden neurons and remove the worthless ones. The model can achieve promising performance with fewer hidden neurons and less prediction time on several benchmark datasets. In DELM model, the margins between different classes are enlarged by learning a nonnegative label relaxation matrix. The experiments validate the effectiveness of DELM. Furthermore, DELM is extended to P-DELM based on L2,1-norm regularization.

Three clinical features and 20 computed tomography features were reviewed. The association between computed tomography features and pathological patterns was analyzed by univariate analysis and random forest. The predictive efficiency of the random forest algorithm was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: There were 92 thymic carcinomas and 45 high-risk thymomas in this study. In univariate analysis, patient age, presence of myasthenia gravis, lesion shape, enhancement pattern, presence of necrosis or cystic change, mediastinal invasion, vessel invasion, lymphadenopathy, pericardial effusion, and distant organ metastasis were found to be statistically different between high-risk thymomas and thymic carcinomas (all P < 0.01). Random forest suggested that tumor shape, lymphadenopathy, and the presence of pericardial effusion were the key features in tumor differentiation. The predictive accuracy for the test data and whole data was 94.73% and 96.35%, respectively. Further receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed the area under the curve was 0.957 (95% confidence interval, 0.986-0.929). ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: The random forest model in the present study has high efficiency in predictive diagnosis of thymic carcinomas and high-risk thymomas. Tumor shape, lymphadenopathy, and pericardial effusion are the key features for tumor differentiation.

EK provides a new insight to model ELMs from the perspective of kernel approximation using random sampling techniques. Particularly, we show that the distribution of random sampling weights, i.e. the input weight of ELM, has deep influences on the classification performance, and we use Gaussian distributions to generate random weights in EKELM. Besides, the number of sampling samples, i.e. the number of hidden neurons in ELM, can be reduced by using a proper nonlinear kernel function. We test the proposed EKELM on 20 benchmark classification datasets, the results prove that using a Gaussian distribution to generate random sampling weights has better performance than uniform distribution.

It is observed that the characters of a script have evolved over years and transformed to the current form. The purpose of this work is to estimate the period of an epigraph which is the initial step towards automating the task of reading and deciphering inscriptions. The proposed system considers a reconstructed grayscale image of an epigraph pertaining to ancient Kannada script as its input, which is binarized using Otsu's method and then segmented to characters using Connected Component analysis. Normalized Central Moments and Zernike Moments are extracted from the segmented characters and used as the feature vectors for classification. Random Forest (RF) is used as the classifier, which is an ensemble of classification trees, and each tree votes for a class and the output class is the majority of the votes which determines the era of the input epigraph. The system developed is used to classify ancient Kannada epigraphs belonging to the period of any of these dynasties: Ashoka, Satavahana, Kadamba, Chalukya, Rastrakuta and Hoysala.

Unfortunately, the current X-ray baggage image database is not big enough in count and diversity for CNN model training. In this paper, we propose a novel method for X-ray prohibited item data augmentation using generative adversarial networks (GANs). The prohibited items are first extracted from X-ray baggage images using a K-nearest neighbor matting scheme. Then, the poses of the obtained item images are estimated using a space rectangular coordinate system and categorized into four or eight classes for constructing a training database. For generating the realistic samples reliably, different GAN models are evaluated using Frechet Inception Distance scores, and some important tips of handling GAN training in X-ray prohibited item image generation are reported. Finally, to verify whether the generated images belong to its corresponding class or not, a cross-validation scheme based on a CNN model is implemented.

It is used to solve the transferring between the support vectors and no-support vectors whether the original simples satisfy the KKT condition of the incremental simples,which can deal with the history data efficiently.

The main goals of this study are the developing of analytical model, by application of Data Mining (DM) techniques, able to estimate the mechanical and physical properties of Jet Grouting (JG) material, namely the evolution of uniaxial compressive strength and elastic Yong modulus over time, as well as the diameter of JG columns. Thus, in this paper, and as a part of the PhD study three Data Mining models, i.e. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Functional Networks (FN) were used to estimate the Elastic Young Modulus (E0) of JG laboratory formulation over time. Furthermore, the results were compared with the Eurocode 2 analytical model. Nowadays, there are several methods to improve the physical and mechanics properties of soil, mainly softsoils, where JG technology is highlight. However, at the design stage of JG, there are still uncertainties because there are no reliable methods that allow the prediction of the diameters and the mechanical properties of the soil-cement elements (Croce and Flora 2001). Thus, given the high potential of JG technology, there is need to develop more rigorous and accurate models of design. In many geotechnical structures advanced designs incorporates the serviceability design criteria. For this purpose, deformability properties of the improved soils are needed. In a non linear stress-strain relationship different moduli can be defined. For this work the initial modulus at very small strains was adopted since, is a laboratory parameter that can be compared with geophysical field test results. In the other hand, powerful tools have emerged that allow extract useful information from large data base (e.g. Data Mining techniques). Thus, we start by adapting the Eurocode 2 analytical model to JG material. Moreover, DM techniques were also applied, which allow to develop a novel predictive model of E0 over time. During the training and validation process of the Data Mining (DM) models, data from huge JG laboratory formulations, prepared on University of Minho were used. The dataset includes 188 results, derived from 9 JG laboratory formulations and 8 input parameters, which are referred as the more relevant parameters in mechanical properties of soil-cement mixtures (Shibazaki 2003). The parameters used were: Water/Cement ratio \u2013 W/C; Age of the mixture \u2013 t; The relation between the mixture porosity and the volumetric content of cement \u2013 n/(Civ) d ; Cement content of the mixture \u2013 %C; Percentage of sand \u2013 %Sand; Percentage of silt \u2013 %Silt; Percentage of clay \u2013 %Clay and Percentage of organic matter \u2013 %OM. The soils used in the preparation of JG laboratory formulations come from five field works in Portugal and Spain. While all of the soils were classified as fine soil they have different percentages of sand, silt, clay and organic matter. All formulations were prepared with cement CEM I 42.5R. and CEM II 42.5R.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2182859943", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["129491993", "15480929", "28088751", "14753843"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15789297"}

There are two minimum requirements for a trading strategy: a rule to enter the market and a rule to exit it. Our proposed system, to enter the currency market, should validate two conditions. First, it should validate Random Forest access rules over the following week while in the second one the predicted value of the next day using Probit should be positive. To exit the currency market just one negative warning from Probit or Random Forest is enough. This system was used to develop dynamic portfolio trading systems. The profitability of the model was examined for USD/(EUR, JYN, BRP) variation within the period from January 2014 to January 2016. The proposed system allows improving the prediction accuracy.

Comparison to the existing state-of-the-art methods, and to manual assessments, confirm that the proposed methods are useful and are more flexible than typical approaches.

We propose a technique to induce sets of if-then-else rules that capture these relations to globally explain the predictions of a network.

We explore this hypothesis and observe that ensemble model predictions obtained when cancer type is known out-perform predictions when that information is withheld even when the samples sizes for the former is considerably lower than the combined sample size. To incorporate the heterogeneity idea in the commonly used ensemble based predictive model of Random Forests, we propose Heterogeneity Aware Random Forests (HARF) that assigns weights to the trees based on the category of the sample.

As for local relation mining, a weakly-constrained hierarchy structure is built to prioritize the correlation for action pairs.

In this paper, we propose a novel training method called manifold matching and a new GAN model called manifold matching GAN (MMGAN). In MMGAN, vector representations extracted from the last layer of the discriminator are used to train the generator. It finds two manifolds representing vector representations of real and fake images. If these two manifolds are matched, it means that real and fake images are identical in the perspective of the discriminator because the manifolds are constructed from the discriminator's last layer. In general, it is much easier to train the discriminator and it becomes more accurate as epoch goes by. This implies that the manifold matching also becomes very accurate as the discriminator is trained. We also use the kernel trick to find better manifolds. We conduct in-depth experiments with three image datasets and several state-of-the-art GAN models.

Support Vector Machines with Applications.", "authors": [{"first": "Grace", "middle": [], "last": "Wahba", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "The authors are to be commended for jumping in to describe support vector machines (SVMs), not an easy thing to do since the the literature for SVMs has grown at least exponentially in the last few years. A Google search for \"support vector machines\" gave \"about 1,180,000\" hits as of this writing. The authors have nevertheless made a nice selection of important points to emphasize. As noted, SVMs were proposed for classification in the early 1990s by arguments like those behind Figure 1 in their paper. The use of SVMs grew rapidly among computer scientists, as it was found that they worked very well in all kinds of prac tical applications. The theoretical underpinnings that went with the original proposals were different than those in the classical statistical literature, for example, those related to Bayes risk, and so had less impact in the statistical literature. The convergence of SVMs and regularization methods (or, rather the convergence of the \"SVM community\" and the \"regularization com munity\") was a major impetus in the study of the (clas sical) statistical properties of the SVM. One point at which this convergence took place was at an Amer ican Mathematical Society meeting at Mt. Holyoke in 1996. The speaker was describing the SVM with the so-called kernel trick when an anonymous person at the back of the room remarked that the SVM with the ker nel trick was the solution to an optimization problem in a reproducing kernel Hubert space (RKHS). Once it was clear to statisticians that the SVM can be obtained as the result of an optimization/regularization problem in a RKHS, tools known to statisticians in this context were rapidly employed to show how the SVM could be modified to take into account nonrepresentative sam ple sizes, unequal misclassification costs and more than two classes, and to show in each case that it directly tar gets the Bayes risk under very general circumstances (see also [5, 8]).

I present a methodology through which burial mounds (tumuli) from LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) DEMS can be identified. This methodology uses geomorphometric and statistical methods to identify with high accuracy burial mound candidates. Peaks, defined as local elevation maxima are found as a first step. In the second step, local convexity watershed segments and their seeds are compared with positions of local peaks and the peaks that correspond or have in vicinity local convexity segments seeds are selected. The local convexity segments that correspond to these selected peaks are further fed to a Random Forest algorithm together with shape descriptors and descriptive statistics of geomorphometric variables in order to build a model for the classification. Multiple approaches to tune and select the proper training dataset, settings, and variables were tested. The validation of the model was performed on the full dataset where the training was performed and on an external dataset in order to test the usability of the method for other areas in a similar geomorphological and archaeological setting. The validation was performed against manually mapped, and field checked burial mounds from two neighbor study areas of 100 km2 each.

Although spatial distribution models may represent an important step forward in science-based ecosystem management, reliable predictions are hard to obtain in deep-sea environments, mainly owing to the usual paucity of high resolution maps in these settings. The aim of this study is to apply and test different spatial models to statistically predict the distribution of two Cold-Water Coral (CWC) species ( Madrepora oculata , Dendrophyllia cornigera ) in the Cap de Creus Canyon (NW Mediterranean), based on high-resolution swath-bathymetry (5 m resolution) and video observations through the manned submersible JAGO (IFM-GEOMAR). Several submarine canyons host CWC communities, as the environmental conditions tend to be particularly suitable for their settlement and development. Along the Cap de Creus Canyon, presence/absence of CWC was estimated in each 5 m resolution pixel based on video imagery. Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), General Additive Model (GAM) and Random Forest were applied to represent non-linear species-environment relationships using terrain variables derived from multibeam bathymetry (slope, rugosity, aspect, backscatter). According to the models, CWC were most likely to be found on the steep walls of the southern flank which face the head and the thalweg of the canyon, aligning with the known CWC ecology acquired from previous studies. Outputs from the three models showed similar average performances in predicting CWC distribution from the available environmental variables. Slope and aspect for Madrepora oculata, and rugosity for Dendrophyllia cornigera drive their distribution, although in some cases the three models identified different variables controlling each species. To reduce differences and associated uncertainties between model outputs, 5 m resolution ensembles were produced for the two species. As a final step, an up-scaled 50 m resolution predictive map based on the fine scale ensembles is proposed as a valuable contribution for stakeholders, which need to manage large natural areas using objective and repeatable science-based approaches.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.pocean.2018.02.012", "venue": null, "journal": "Progress in Oceanography", "mag_id": "2790458312", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["210956271", "189863560"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134805745"}

SVM have been extensively and successfully used as a sentiment learning approach while Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have rarely been considered in comparative studies in the sentiment analysis literature. This paper presents an empirical comparison between SVM and ANN regarding document-level sentiment analysis.

We adopt a standard evaluation context with popular supervised methods for feature selection and weighting in a traditional bag-of-words model. Except for some unbalanced data contexts, our experiments indicated that ANN produce superior or at least comparable results to SVM's. Specially on the benchmark dataset of Movies reviews, ANN outperformed SVM by a statistically significant difference, even on the context of unbalanced data. Our results have also confirmed some potential limitations of both models, which have been rarely discussed in the sentiment classification literature, like the computational cost of SVM at the running time and ANN at the training time.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2012.07.059", "venue": "Expert Syst.

This is a challenging task as no ground truth is available. This paper presents a data-driven approach to learn to predict image denoising quality. Our method is based on the observation that while individual existing quality metrics and denoising models alone cannot robustly rank denoising results, they often complement each other. We accordingly design denoising quality features based on these existing metrics and models and then use Random Forests Regression to aggregate them into a more powerful unified metric. Our experiments on images with various types and levels of noise show that our no-reference denoising quality assessment method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art quality metrics.

The achieved results allow us to conclude that the developed neural model predictive control is adequate to control effectively a four-effect evaporator to concentrate grape juice with different characteristics; its application at industrial scale is possible in the future.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/S1570-7946(09)70623-6", "venue": null, "journal": "Computer-aided chemical engineering", "mag_id": "201061003", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:108141039"}

Following the decomposition-reconstruction-prediction concept, a combined Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition-Least Square Support Vector Machine-Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (EEMD-LSSVM-ARIMA) model is proposed for quantitatively analyzing and forecasting coal overcapacity in China. The results show that the main causes of coal overcapacity in China include insufficient demand, market failure, and institutional distortion. Institutional distortion, with an influence degree of 73.75%, is the most fundamental and influential factor. From 2017 to 2019, the scale of coal overcapacity in China will reach between 1.721and 1.819 billion tons, suggesting that coal overcapacity will remain a serious problem. The rate of coal overcapacity caused by insufficient demand will fluctuate slightly, while coal overcapacity caused by market failure will trend downward, but the impact of institutional distortion on coal overcapacity will be exacerbated.

QoIs include species decay, product yield, and degree of mixing. The ROMs for QoIs are applied to quantify and understand how the chemical species evolve over time. First, high-resolution datasets for constructing ROMs are generated by solving anisotropic reaction-diffusion equations using a non-negative finite element formulation for different input parameters. Non-negative finite element formulation ensures that the species concentration is non-negative (which is needed for computing QoIs) on coarse computational grids even under high anisotropy. The reactive-mixing model input parameters are a time-scale associated with flipping of velocity, a spatial-scale controlling small/large vortex structures of velocity, a perturbation parameter of the vortex-based velocity, anisotropic dispersion strength/contrast, and molecular diffusion. Second, random forests, F-test, and mutual information criterion are used to evaluate the importance of model inputs/features with respect to QoIs. Third, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) are used to construct ROMs based on the model inputs. Then, SVR-ROMs are used to predict scaling of QoIs. Qualitatively, SVR-ROMs are able to describe the trends observed in the scaling law associated with QoIs. Fourth, the scaling law's exponent dependence on model inputs/features are evaluated using $k$-means clustering.

It is a challenging task due to the non-uniform distribution of light in semen smear images, low contrast between sperm's tail and its surrounding region, the existence of various artifacts, high concentration of sperms and wide spectrum of the shapes of the sperm's parts. This paper proposes an automatic framework based on concatenated learning approaches to segment the external and internal parts of the sperms. The external parts of the sperms are segmented using two convolutional neural network (CNN) models which produce the probability maps of the head and the axial filament regions. To obtain acrosome and nucleus segments, the K-means clustering approach is applied to the head segments. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used to classify each pixel of the axial filament segments to extract tail and mid-piece regions from obtained segments. The proposed method is validated on the images of the Gold-standard dataset. It achieves 0.90, 0.77, 0.77, 0.78, 0.75 and 0.64 of the average of dice similarity coefficient for the head, axial filament, acrosome, nucleus, tail, and mid-piece segments, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for the head and its internal parts segmentation.

A set of features are extracted from images of WBCs and then the optimized algorithm is used to obtain a subset of those features which are essential and more relevant from the high-dimensional dataset.

We applied Bayesian estimates to model the probability distribution of descriptors values used for binary classification using n-fold cross-validation. As a measure for the discriminative power of the classifiers, the symmetric form of the Kullback-Leibler divergence of their probability distributions was computed. We found that the most relevant descriptors possess a Gaussian-like distribution of their values, show the largest divergences, and therefore appear most often in the cross-validation scenario. The results were compared to those of the LASSO feature selection method applied to multiple decision trees and support vector machine approaches for data sets of substrates and nonsubstrates of three Cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, which comprise strongly unbalanced compound distributions. In contrast to decision trees and support vector machines, the performance of Bayesian estimates is less affected by unbalanced data sets.

Therefore, understanding the intrinsic mechanisms underlying the genome and informing clinical practices have become two important missions of large-scale genomic research. Recently, high-throughput molecular data have provided abundant information about the whole genome, and have popularized computational tools in genomics. However, traditional machine learning methodologies often suffer from strong limitations when dealing with high-throughput genomic data, because the latter are usually very high dimensional, highly heterogeneous, and can show complicated nonlinear effects. In this thesis, we present five new algorithms or models to address these challenges, each of which is applied to a specific genomic problem.Project 1 focuses on model selection in cancer diagnosis. We develop an efficient algorithm (ADMM-ENSVM) for the Elastic Net Support Vector Machine, which achieves simultaneous variable selection and max-margin classification. On a colon cancer diagnosis dataset, ADMM-ENSVM shows advantages over other SVM algorithms in terms of diagnostic accuracy, feature selection ability, and computational efficiency.Project 2 focuses on model selection in gene correlation analysis. We develop an efficient algorithm (SBLVGG) using the similar methodology as of ADMM-ENSVM for the Latent Variable Gaussian Graphical Model (LVGG). LVGG models the marginal concentration matrix of observed variables as a combination of a sparse matrix and a low rank one. Evaluated on a microarray dataset containing 6,316 genes, SBLVGG is notably faster than the state-of-the-art LVGG solver, and shows that most of the correlation among genes can be effectively explained by only tens of latent factors.Project 3 focuses on ensemble learning in cancer survival analysis. We develop a gradient boosting model (GBMCI), which does not explicitly assume particular forms of hazard functions, but trains an ensemble of regression trees to approximately optimize the concordance index. We benchmark the performance of GBMCI against several popular survival models on a large-scale breast cancer prognosis dataset. GBMCI consistently outperforms other methods based on a number of feature representations, which are heterogeneous and contain missing values. Project 4 focuses on deep learning in gene expression inference (GEIDN). GEIDN is a large-scale neural network, which can infer ~21k target genes jointly from ~1k landmark genes and can naturally capture hierarchical nonlinear interactions among genes. We deploy deep learning techniques (drop out, momentum training, GPU computing, etc.) to train GEIDN. On a dataset of ~129k complete human transcriptomes, GEIDN outperforms both k-nearest neighbor regression and linear regression in predicting >99.96% of the target genes. Moreover, increased network scales help to improve GEIDN, while increased training data benefits GEIDN more than other methods.Project 5 focuses on deep learning in annotating coding and noncoding genetic variants (DANN). DANN is a neural network to differentiate evolutionarily derived alleles from simulated ones with 949 highly heterogeneous features. It can capture nonlinear relationships among features. We train DANN with deep learning techniques like for GEIDN. DANN achieves a 18.90% relative reduction in the error rate and a 14.52% relative increase in the area under the curve over CADD, a state-of-the-art algorithm to annotate genetic variants based on the linear SVM.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2527273336", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:40693659"}

To assess the importance of this region as a surrogate marker for the identification of highly virulent extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) strains we aimed to: (i) characterize the genetic diversity of the mutS gene and the o454-nlpD genomic region among 510 E. coli strains from animals and humans; (ii) delineate associations between the polymorphism of this region and features such as phylogenetic background of E. coli, pathotype, host species, clinical condition, serogroup and virulence associated genes (VAG)s; and (iii) identify the most important VAGs for classification of the o454-nlpD region. Size variation in the o454-nlpD region was investigated by PCR amplification and sequencing. Phylogenetic relationships were assessed by Ecor- and Multilocus sequence- typing (MLST), and a comparative analysis between mutS gene phylogenetic tree obtained with RAxML and the MLST grouping method was performed. Correlation between o454-nlpD patterns and the features described above were analysed. In addition, the importance of 47 PCR-amplified ExPEC-related VAGs for classification of o454-nlpD patterns was investigated by means of Random Forest algorithm. Four main structures (patterns I-IV) of the o454-nlpD region among ExPEC and commensal E. coli strains were identified. Statistical analysis showed a positive and exclusive association between pattern III and the ExPEC strains. A strong association between pattern III and either the Ecor group B2 or the sequence type complexes known to represent the phylogenetic background of highly virulent ExPEC strains (such as STC95, STC73 and STC131) was found as well. RF analyses determined five genes (csgA, malX, chuA, sit, and vat) to be suitable to predict pattern III strains. The significant association between pattern III and group B2 strains suggested the o454-nlpD region to be of great value in identifying highly virulent strains among the mixed population of E. coli promising to be the basis of a future typing tool for ExPEC and their gut reservoir. Furthermore, top-ranked VAGs for classification and prediction of pattern III were identified.

One approach to deal with this problem is to apply a generalized linear model with a link function and solve it by calculating the maximum likelihood estimate. But, if the link function is nonlinear, maximizing the likelihood will face with difficulties. Instead, we propose a new approach which train an SVM for a ranking function, then map the SVM outputs into a probabilistic sigmoid function whose parameters are trained by using cross-validation.

To address these issues, experts in knowledge management must support organizations to come up with solutions and answers. However, in many cases, the precision and ambiguity of their concepts are not the most appropriate. This article describes a method for the diagnosis and initial assessment of knowledge management. The proposed method uses machine-learning techniques to analyze different aspects and conditions associated with knowledge transfer.

Half of the world's population is housed in urban settlements. For instance, the growth of informal settlements in South Africa has amplified after the end of apartheid. In order to transform informal settlements to improve the living conditions in these areas, a lot of spatial information is required. There are many traditional methods used to collect these data, such as statistical analysis and fieldwork; but these methods are limited to capture urban processes, particularly informal settlements are very dynamic in nature with respect to time and space. Remote sensing has been proven to provide more efficient techniques to study and monitor spatial patterns of settlements structures with high spatial resolution. Recently, a new feature method, local directional pattern (LDP), based on kirsch masks, has been proposed and widely used in biometrics feature extraction. In this study, we investigate the use of LDP for the classification of informal settlements. Performance of LDP in characterizing informal settlements is then evaluated and compared to the popular gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) using four classifiers (Naive-Bayes, Multilayer perceptron, Support Vector Machines, k-nearest Neighbor). The experimental results show that LDP outperforms GLCM in classifying informal settlements.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jart.2016.12.009", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Applied Research and Technology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2619983892", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["143454951", "58591872", "206787478", "10151608", "18779642", "6801765", "17253770", "120323383", "64221480", "109047268", "23916708", "206786900", "10767213", "15874442", "34934153", "18657059", "14238476", "35913714", "18150023", "21529335", "62233850", "128412909", "134646325", "1544521", "2642435", "7138354"], "inbound_citations": ["204090637", "214640011", "53095391", "211551262"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125996930"}

In this article a 1-v-1 tri-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) is presented. The expansion of the architecture of this machine into three categories specifically addresses the decomposition problem of how to prevent the loss of information which occurs in the usual 1-v-1 training procedure. The proposed machine, by means of a third class, allows all the information to be incorporated into the remaining training patterns when a multi-class problem is considered in the form of a 1-v-1 decomposition. Three general structures are presented where each improves some features from the precedent structure. In order to deal with multi-classification problems, it is demonstrated that the final machine proposed allows ordinal regression as a form of decomposition procedure.

In this work, we demonstrate the use of machine learning to identify such interacting residues and the use of template engineering strategies to increase the fraction of active variants in a library. We show that using the sequences from recombination of monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) and Discosoma red fluorescent protein (DsRed), we were able to identify a pair of interacting residues using an algorithm based on Boolean Learning and Support Vector Machines. The interaction between the identified residues was verified through point mutations on the mRFP and DsRed genes. We also show that it is possible to use such results to alter the parental genes such that the probability of disrupting the important interactions is minimized. This will result in a larger fraction of active variants in the recombinant library and allow us to access more functional space.

Predicting ENP mobility in soil systems based on common attributes of either soil or ENPs is of significant interest as an alternative to conducting laborious and time consuming column experiments. Thus this study investigates the importance of different soil properties and experimental conditions on titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nTiO2) mobility in real soil media and also evaluates four different modelling approaches including Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for predicting nTiO2 mobility in soil media. The performance of both ANN and RF models were good for predicting nTiO2 transport in soil media, with ANN predictions being slightly superior to RF with less generalization errors. However, RF had the advantage of requiring less input predictors. In comparison the MLR model exhibited poor performance in both calibration and validation datasets, and while the validity of CART was almost acceptable in the calibration dataset, its efficiency was poor for the validation dataset.

It is hypothesised that data mining techniques provide more accurate SWRC-PTFs than statistical linear regression. However, data-mining techniques are often proven as highly data-demanding techniques. The aim of this study was, therefore, to verify that hypothesis for a limited data set of tropical delta soils by comparing the predictive capabilities of point PTFs and pseudo-continuous (PC) PTFs developed by Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine for Regression (SVR), and k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN) methods. The results show that point-PTFs derived from data-mining techniques (i.e. ANN, SVR, kNN) offer accurate and reliable estimation of soil water content at several matric potentials. In case of PC-PTFs, ANN and kNN models outperformed SVR and MLR PTFs in validation phase (RMSE of ANN and kNN PTFs were around 0.05 m3 m\u22123, while those of SVR PTFs and MLR PTFs rose up to 0.068 and 0.066 m3 m\u22123). Our findings confirm the superiority of data-mining approaches in modelling the complex system of soil and water, even when a limited data set is available.

The research reported in this paper seeks to develop a better clinical decision support algorithm for clinicians diagnosis. This paper presents a probabilistic method for detection and segmentation between abnormal tissue regions and brain tumour (tumour core and edema) portions from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). A framework is constructed to learn structure of undirected graphical models that can represent the spatial relationships among variables and apply it to glioma segmentation. Compared with the pixel of image, the superpixel is more consistent with human visual cognition and contains less redundancy, thus, the superpixels are considered as the basic unit of structure learning and glioma segmentation scheme. \u21131-regularization techniques are applied to learn the appropriate structure for modeling graphical models. Conditional Random Fields (CRF) are used to model the spatial interactions among image superpixel regions and their measurements. A number of features including statistics features, the combined features from the local binary pattern as well as gray level run length, curve features, and fractal features were extracted from each superpixel. The features are then passed by \u21131-regularization to ensure a robust classification. The proposed method is compared with support vector machine and Fuzzy c-means to classify each superpixel into normal and abnormal tissue. The proposed system is tested for the presence of low grade as well as high grade glioma tumors on images collected from BRATS2013, BRATS2015 data set and Henan Provincial People's Hospital (HNPPH) data set.

To quantify such traits from images of root systems, researchers often have to choose between automated tools (that are prone to error and extract only a limited number of architectural traits) or semi-automated ones (that are highly time consuming). Findings We trained a Random Forest algorithm to infer architectural traits from automatically-extracted image descriptors. The training was performed on a subset of the dataset, then applied to its entirety. This strategy allowed us to (i) decrease the image analysis time by 73% and (ii) extract meaningful architectural traits based on image descriptors. We also show that these traits are sufficient to identify Quantitative Trait Loci that had previously been discovered using a semi-automated method. Conclusions We have shown that combining semi-automated image analysis with machine learning algorithms has the power to increase the throughput in large scale root studies.

When faults occur in a power system, the protective relays detect the fault and initiate tripping of appropriate circuit breakers, which isolate the affected part from the rest of the power system. Generally extra high voltage (EHV) transmission substations in power systems are connected with multiple transmission lines to neighboring substations. In some cases mal-operation of relays can happen under varying operating conditions, because of inappropriate coordination of relay settings. Due to these actions the power system margins for contingencies are decreasing. Hence, power system protective relaying reliability becomes increasingly important. In this paper an approach is presented using support vector machine (SVM) as an intelligent tool for identifying the faulted line that is emanating from a substation and finding the distance from the substation. Results on 24-bus equivalent EHV system, part of Indian southern grid, are presented for illustration purpose. This approach is particularly important to avoid mal-operation of relays following a disturbance in the neighboring line connected to the same substation and assuring secure operation of the power systems", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/POWERI.2006.1632511", "venue": "2006 IEEE Power India Conference", "journal": "2006 IEEE Power India Conference", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1481184476", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["24384171", "194951", "110042126", "28637672", "59718844", "53904563", "57961414", "961425", "192934"], "inbound_citations": ["16830029", "22933447", "110779453", "10514496", "6091597"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5833924"}

This issue becomes even more challenging under difficult operational conditions, especially in regions with extreme cold winter or wet tropical climate. For example, a potential application of PEM fuel cell in cold regions is to power a high-altitude mountain refuge, where the connexion to the grid is impossible. Coupled with a solar panel and an electrolyzer, the fuel cell can fulfill the power need of the visitors. As the fuel cell will often be at its resting state during severe winter when there is no visitors in the refuge, the experimental research on the degradation of PEM fuel cell under this condition is necessary. Furthermore, prognostic tools are also needed to predict the state of health and to estimate the Remaining Useful Lifetime (RUL) of fuel cells, in order to make the systems more reliable, and to maintain them more efficiently with reduced costs. The aim of this work is to present the first experimental results of an open cathode PEM fuel cell gone through negative temperatures. As a certain number of researches [3-5] have shown evident performance losses of PEM fuel cells after suffering freezing-thaw cycles, some studies investigated the mechanisms of degradation within the PEM fuel cells structures at micro scale (~\u00b5m). Scanning Electron Microscope images show material damages at different locations of PEMFCs, especially at gas diffusion layer, catalyst layer and membrane levels. The principal cause of these damages are due to the remaining water produced by chemical reactions within the fuel cell. During the freezing state, the formation of ice from water could lead to irreversible degradations and reduce largely the remaining useful lifetime of PEM fuel cells. In this work, a test bench has been designed in lab to characterize two identical open cathode PEMFCs, by performing polarization curve and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) of the fuel cells. After the first characterization, one of the fuel cell will undergo negative temperature cycles as low as -30\u00b0C for 20-day-long duration in a cold-room, and then will be characterized again in order to be compared to the other fuel cell which will be stored under normal environmental conditions. With this comparison study, the influence of extreme negative temperatures on the performance of a typical open cathode PEM fuel cell will be observed, and raw experimental data for later prognosis will be gathered in order to predict the RUL. As a perspective, an algorithm of prognosis based on Reservoir Computing (RC), which is a new paradigm of artificial neural networks will be tested with the experimental data.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2985377151", "mag_field_of_study": ["Materials Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201781417"}

However, it has become increasingly known that specific genetic abnormalities are responsible for the carcinogenesis of multiple cancers.

Despite a promising future, methodological development for identifying multi-cancer molecular targets remains encumbered. This study developed a novel machine learning approach to identify such genes responsible for multiple cancers by synthesizing salient genomic information from cancer-specific classification models. This approach centered on the cross-cancer prediction method for identifying groups of cancers with high cross-cancer predictability. Furthermore, a robust hybrid classifier, comprising Prediction Analysis for Microarrays and Random Forest, was developed to integrate predictive models for gene inference.

The process of classifying a pattern with high classification accuracy counts mainly on tuning Support Vector Machine parameters which are the generalization error parameter and the kernel function parameter. Tuning these parameters is a complex process and may be done experimentally through time consuming human experience. To overcome this difficulty, an approach such as Ant Colony Optimization can tune Support Vector Machine parameters. Ant Colony Optimization originally deals with discrete optimization problems. Hence, in applying Ant Colony Optimization for optimizing Support Vector Machine parameters, which are continuous parameters, there is a need to discretize the continuous value into a discrete value. This discretization process results in loss of some information and, hence, affects the classification accuracy and seek time. This study proposes an algorithm to optimize Support Vector Machine parameters using continuous Ant Colony Optimization without the need to discretize continuous values for Support Vector Machine parameters.

We coupled GPS location data of lynx in Washington in an area with several recent large fires and a number of GIS layers of habitat data to develop models of lynx habitat selection in recent burns. Random Forest habitat models showed lynx-selected islands of forest skipped by large fires, residual vegetation, and areas where some trees survived to use newly burned areas. Lynx used burned areas as early as 1 year postfire, which is much earlier than the 2-4 decades postfire previously thought for this predator. These findings are encouraging for predator persistence in the face of fires, but increasingly severe fires or management that reduces postfire residual trees or slow regeneration will likely jeopardize lynx and other predators.

Moreover, all the sequence, structure and machine learning based algorithms are unable to distribute the true positive predictions preferentially at the top of the ranked list; hence the algorithms become unreliable to the biologists. In addition, these algorithms fail to obtain considerable combination of precision and recall for the target transcripts that are translationally repressed at protein level. ::: Methodology/Principal Finding ::: In the proposed article, we introduce an efficient miRNA-target prediction system MultiMiTar, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifier integrated with a multiobjective metaheuristic based feature selection technique. The robust performance of the proposed method is mainly the result of using high quality negative examples and selection of biologically relevant miRNA-targeting site context specific features. The features are selected by using a novel feature selection technique AMOSA-SVM, that integrates the multi objective optimization technique Archived Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (AMOSA) and SVM. ::: Conclusions/Significance ::: MultiMiTar is found to achieve much higher Matthew\u2019s correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.583 and average class-wise accuracy (ACA) of 0.8 compared to the others target prediction methods for a completely independent test data set. The obtained MCC and ACA values of these algorithms range from \u22120.269 to 0.155 and 0.321 to 0.582, respectively. Moreover, it shows a more balanced result in terms of precision and sensitivity (recall) for the translationally repressed data set as compared to all the other existing methods.

It is known that fingerprints show difference in males and females, and it is explained that women's line details are thin whereas men's line details are thick. However, the statistical studies, which have been made to prove the relationship between fingerprint and gender, have not investigated if the hypothesis is true for all ethnical backgrounds. In this study, we have examined if gender inference can be made only through fingerprint feature vectors, which belong to Turkish subjects, by using our database consisting of Naive Bayes, kNN, Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine learning algorithms.

The hierarchy of binary decision subtasks using SVMs is designed with a clustering algorithm. For consistency between the clustering model and SVM, the clustering model utilizes distance measures at the kernel space, rather than at the input space. The proposed SVM based Binary Decision Tree architecture takes advantage of both the efficient computation of the decision tree architecture and the high classification accuracy of SVMs. The SVMBDT architecture was designed to provide superior multi-class classification performance. Its performance was measured on samples from MNIST, Pendigit, Optdigit and Statlog databases of handwritten digits and letters. The results of the experiments indicate that while maintaining comparable or offering better accuracy with other SVM based approaches, ensembles of trees (Bagging and Random Forest) and neural network, the training phase of SVM-BDT is faster. During recognition phase, due to its logarithmic complexity, SVM-BDT is much faster than the widely used multi-class SVM methods like \u201cone-against-one\u201d and \u201cone-against-all\u201d, for multiclass problems. Furthermore, the experiments showed that the proposed method becomes more favourable as the number of classes in the recognition problem increases.

We exploit the generative adversarial networks (GANs) for removing backgrounds while retaining the text content. As vanilla GANs are not sufficiently robust to generate sequence-like characters in natural images, we propose an adversarial learning framework for the generation and recognition of multiple characters in an image. The proposed framework consists of an attention-based recognizer and a generative adversarial architecture. Furthermore, to tackle the lack of paired training samples, we design an interactive joint training scheme, which shares attention masks from the recognizer to the discriminator, and enables the discriminator to extract the features of every character for further adversarial training. Benefiting from the character-level adversarial training, our framework requires only unpaired simple data for style supervision. Every target style sample containing only one randomly chosen character can be simply synthesized online during the training. This is significant as the training does not require costly paired samples or character-level annotations. Thus, only the input images and corresponding text labels are needed. In addition to the style transfer of the backgrounds, we refine character patterns to ease the recognition task. A feedback mechanism is proposed to bridge the gap between the discriminator and the recognizer. Therefore, the discriminator can guide the generator according to the confusion of the recognizer. The generated patterns are thus clearer for recognition. Experiments on various benchmarks, including both regular and irregular text, demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the difficulty of recognition.

Lazy Learning (LL) is a local learning technique that, once a query is received, extracts a prediction by locally interpolating the neighboring examples of the query which are considered relevant according to a distance measure. Local learning techniques are often criticized for their limitations in dealing with problems with high number of features and large samples. Similarly wrapper methods are considered prohibitive for large number of features, due to the high cost of the evaluation step. The paper aims to show that a wrapper feature selection method based on LL can take advantage of two effective strategies: racing and subsampling.

Field experiments were conducted during growing seasons, 2012, 2013 and 2014 in Potsdam, Germany. Different treatments of N fertilization and water regimes were applied to the plant. Aboveground biomass was sampled three times during each season, and analyzed for plant nitrogen content, fresh and dry biomasses, and water content. Color images of the plant canopy were taken in the field by a digital camera. The images were then processed and various features were derived. Multivariable models using the features and two different algorithms, Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) and Random Forest (RF) were developed. The models were built for data of single sampling dates and combination of sampling dates of each season. In addition, spectral measurements were taken by a portable field spectroradiometer and a few vegetation indices (VIs) were calculated. Linear regression models were built between the VIs and the plant parameters. According to the results obtained, PLSR presented the strongest models for both single-date and combined-dates data. R 2 (corresponding RMSE) of the models for N content and water content varied in the range of 0.77\u20130.91 (0.25\u20130.14), and 0.53\u20130.95 (0.75\u20130.36), respectively, for single-date data, and 0.76\u20130.89 (0.24\u20130.15), and 0.65\u20130.92 (1.49\u20131.66), respectively, for combined-dates data.

In this study, we propose three different methods for ensemble probabilistic forecasting, derived from seven individual machine learning models, to generate 24-h ahead solar power forecasts. We have shown that while all of the individual machine learning models are more accurate than the traditional benchmark models, like autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), the ensemble models offer even more accurate results than any individual machine learning model alone does. Furthermore, it is observed that running separate models on the data belonging to the same hour of the day vastly improves the accuracy of the results.

In our proposed robust watermarking model, a double layer security is introduced to ensure the robustness of embedded data. The embedded data is scrambled using a unique key and then a transform domain based hybrid watermarking technique is used to embed the scrambled data into the transform coefficients of the host image. The data embedding in medical images involves more attention, so that the diagnosis part must not be affected by any modification. Therefore, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used as a classifier, which classify a medical image into two regions i.e. Non Region of Interest (NROI) and Region of Interest (ROI) to embed watermark data into the NROI part of the medical image, using the proposed embedding algorithm. The objective of the proposed model is to avoid any quality degradation to the medical image. The simulation is performed to measure the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) for imperceptibility and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to test the robustness.

Although falls have a multifactorial etiology, a commonly cited cause of falls in older people is poor vision. This study proposes a method to discriminate fallers and non-fallers among ophthalmic patients, based on data-mining algorithms applied to health and socio-demographic information. A group of 150 subjects aged 55 years and older, recruited at the Eye Clinic of the Second University of Naples, underwent a baseline ophthalmic examination and a standardized questionnaire, including lifestyles, general health, social engagement and eyesight problems. A subject who reported at least one fall within one year was considered as faller, otherwise as non-faller. Different tree-based data-mining algorithms (i.e., C4.5, Adaboost and Random Forest) were used to develop automatic classifiers and their performances were evaluated by assessing the receiver-operator characteristics curve estimated with the 10-fold-crossvalidation approach. The best predictive model, based on Random Forest, enabled to identify fallers with a sensitivity and specificity rate of 72.6% and 77.9%, respectively. The most informative variables were: intraocular pressure, best corrected visual acuity and the answers to the total difficulty score of the Activities of Daily Vision Scale (a questionnaire for the measurement of visual disability). The current study confirmed that some ophthalmic features (i.e. cataract surgery, lower intraocular pressure values) could be associated with a lower fall risk among visually impaired subjects.

Almost all the paddy varieties being sold in the market are prone to adulteration. It is very difficult to differentiate paddy grains of various varieties in the mixed bulk sample based on visual observation. Currently, there is no sophisticated appearance-based commercial scale technology to reliably detect and quantify adulteration in bulk paddy grain samples. The paper presents a cost-effective image processing technique for the recognition of adulteration and classification of adulteration levels (%) from the images of adulterated bulk paddy samples using state-of-the-art color and texture features. In this work, seven adulterated bulk paddy samples are considered and each of the samples is prepared by mixing a premium paddy variety with the identical looking and commercially inferior paddy variety at five different adulteration levels (weight ratios) of 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% and 30%. The study compares the performances of three different classification models, namely, Multilayer Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN). The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Sequential Forward Floating Selection (SFFS) methods have been employed separately for the automatic selection of optimal feature subsets from the combined color and texture features. The maximum average adulteration level classification accuracy of 93.31% is obtained using the BPNN classification model trained with PCA-based reduced features. The proposed technique can be used as an economic, rapid, non-destructive and quantitative technique for testing adulteration, authenticity, and quality of bulk paddy grain samples.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.inpa.2018.09.001", "venue": null, "journal": "Information Processing in Agriculture", "mag_id": "2904143731", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125484266"}

To address these issues, this article proposes a methodology similar to the KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) to classify Education Quality in schools comparatively, based on grades scored in school performance tests. For the purposes of this study, the test used was the Prova Brasil examination, which is part of the Basic Education Development Index (IDEB) used in Brazil. The methodology was applied to public municipal schools in the town of Arauca\u0301ria in the metropolitan district of Curitiba in Parana\u0301 State. Seventeen schools that offer elementary and junior high school education were included. All the grades of every student were considered from the early and later years at the schools. During the Data Mining stage, the main stage of the KDD process, three comparative methods were used for Pattern Recognition: Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines and Genetic Algorithms. These methods supplied satisfactory results in the classification of schools represented by way of a \u201cQuality Label\u201d, with Artificial Neural Networks having the best performance for the problem in question.

As the spinal cord is relaying sensorimotor control signals from the cortex to the peripheral nervous system and viceversa, it is an interesting question to assess whether it is affected by atrophy in a disease that is known for its involvement of cognitive domains first and foremost, with motor symptoms being clinically assessed too. We hypothesize that Alzheimer\u2019s Disease severe atrophy can affect the spinal cord and that spinal cord atrophy is an important in-vivo imaging biomarker contributing to understanding neurodegeneration associated with dementia. Methods: 3DT1 images of 31 Alzheimer\u2019s disease(AD) and 35 healthy-control(HC) subjects were processed to calculate volumes of brain structures and cross-sectional area(CSA) and volume(CSV) of the cervical cord(per vertebra and C2-C3 pair(CSA23, CSV23)).Correlated features(\u03c1>0.7) were removed, and best subset identified for patients\u2019 classification with Random Forest algorithm. General linear model regression was used to find significant differences between groups(p<=0.05). Linear regression was implemented to assess the explained variance of the Mini Mental State Examination(MMSE) score as dependent variable with best features as predictors. Results: Spinal cord features were significantly reduced in AD, independently of brain volumes. Patients classification reached 76%accuracy when including CSA23 together with volumes of hippocampi, left amygdala, white and grey matter, with 74%sensitivity and 78%specificity. CSA23 alone explained 13%of MMSE variance. Discussion: Our findings reveal that C2-C3 spinal cord atrophy contributes to discriminate AD from HC, together with established features. Results show that CSA23, calculated form the same 3DT1 as all other brain volumes(including right and left hippocampi), has a considerable weight in classification tasks warranting further investigations. Together with recent studies revealing that AD atrophy is spread beyond the temporal lobes, our result adds the spinal cord to a number of unsuspected regions involved in the disease. Spinal cord atrophy explains also cognitive scores, which could significantly impact how we model sensorimotor control in degenerative diseases with a primary cognitive domain involvement. Prospective studies should be purposely designed to understand the mechanisms of atrophy and the role of the spinal cord in AD.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC7002560", "pubmed_id": "32082122", "doi": "10.3389/fncel.2020.00006", "venue": "Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3003291611", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["3216666", "205670880", "34658172", "39359840", "9725279", "215308147", "52074629", "42827908", "89141", "2531481", "2676670", "17636362", "10981848", "12805900", "3086917", "3758985", "215248887", "1577725", "3886200", "1891543", "54995159", "215096681", "51902974", "25702304", "8163596", "2801550", "215417991", "6787660", "3343219", "90932789", "15194747", "214938220", "6178557", "123466489", "42793845", "4907444", "299661", "124868013", "17477261", "205344886", "14780428", "43202848", "8888437", "31801533", "215266652", "15349013", "4601762", "58602105", "2579276", "25082315"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210944291"}

Our approach solves the labeling problem, determining gesture categories and their temporal ranges at the same time. A generative probabilistic model is formalized and probability densities are nonparametrically estimated by matching input features with a training dataset. In addition to the conventional skeletal joint-based features, the appearance information near the active hand in an RGB image is exploited to capture the detailed motion of fingers. The estimated likelihood function is then used as the unary term for our CRF model. The smoothness term is also incorporated to enforce the temporal coherence of our solution.

To estimate the parameters of the proposed CRF model, we incorporate the structured support vector machine (SSVM) framework that can perform efficient structured learning by using large-scale datasets.

A Gaussian prior of the variance is assumed across all subjects and the variance from regular ones are transferred to the under-represented ones. This encourages the under-represented distribution to be closer to the regular distribution. Further, an alternating training regimen is proposed to simultaneously achieve less biased classifiers and a more discriminative feature representation.

To address this challenge, we have developed a cost-effective mapping procedure based on 250-m MODIS imagery that produces annual land-use/land-cover (LULC) maps for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). This procedure uses annual spectral statistics, collection of references samples with a Web-based tool, and tree-based Random Forests classifiers stratified by biome map regions to produce wall-to-wall, annual LULC maps for 2001 to 2010 that cover all of LAC. Across 26 map regions, overall pixel-level accuracy averaged 80.2 \u00b1 8.1% for eight basic LULC classes, and 84.6 \u00b1 6.5% for a five-class scheme. Municipality-scale area change between 2001 and 2010 in the three dominant classes (woody vegetation, mixed woody/plantation, and agriculture/herbaceous vegetation) was then estimated using regression models fit to 10 years of data, thus minimizing the impact of inter-annual class variation on change statistics. Closed-canopy forest area and change between 2001 and 2009 were well correlated with high-resolution maps of the Brazilian Legal Amazon (PRODES project). Our LAC-wide analysis of significant change revealed the recent extent and magnitude of deforestation hotspots, such as in the Amazon moist forests and the dry forests of Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia. Our data also revealed biome-specific clusters of municipalities with increasing woody vegetation due to forest recovery, reforestation, or woody encroachment. Taken as a whole, our MODIS-based mapping and trend modeling methodology can provide reliable land change data, not just for the tropics or for forest cover, but for all biomes and municipalities in LAC and including multiple LULC classes.

The running times of our algorithms depend nearly linearly on the input size and polylogarithmically on the desired accuracy and problem condition number. Leveraging these results we also provide improved running times for a broader range of problems including computing random walk-based graph kernels, computing Katz centrality, and more. The running times of our algorithms improve upon previously known results which either depended polynomially on the condition number of the problem, required quadratic time, or only applied to special cases.

Moreover, evaluations using Jackknife Estimation show stable and reliable results from several experiment runs of the non-deterministic strategy. The non-deterministic approach in searching hyperparameter shows a significant accuracy and better computer resources (i.e cpu and memory time) utilization.

We put forth a 2-stage network: a physics-based backbone followed by a depth-guided GAN refinement. The first stage estimates the rain streaks, the transmission, and the atmospheric light governed by the underlying physics. To tease out these components more reliably, a guided filtering framework is used to decompose the image into its low- and high-frequency components. This filtering is guided by a rain-free residue image --- its content is used to set the passbands for the two channels in a spatially-variant manner so that the background details do not get mixed up with the rain-streaks. For the second stage, the refinement stage, we put forth a depth-guided GAN to recover the background details failed to be retrieved by the first stage, as well as correcting artefacts introduced by that stage.

In this paper, our objective was to identify the climate signal in the realized yields of maize, sorghum, and groundnut in SSA. We explored the relation between crop yields and scale-compatible climate data for the 1962-2014 period using Random Forest, a diagnostic machine learning technique. We found that improved agricultural technology and country fixed effects are three times more important than climate variables for explaining changes in crop yields in SSA. We also found that increasing temperatures reduced yields for all three crops in the temperature range observed in SSA, while precipitation increased yields up to a level roughly matching crop evapotranspiration. Crop yields exhibited both linear and nonlinear responses to temperature and precipitation, respectively. For maize, technology steadily increased yields by about 1% (13 kg/ha) per year while increasing temperatures decreased yields by 0.8% (10 kg/ha) per \u00b0C.

Batch normalization (BN) techniques have been introduced to address the training problem. However, though BN accelerates training in the beginning, our experiments show that the use of BN can be unstable and negatively impact the quality of the trained model. The evaluation of BN and numerous other recent schemes for improving GAN training is hindered by the lack of an effective objective quality measure for GAN models. To address these issues, we first introduce a weight normalization (WN) approach for GAN training that significantly improves the stability, efficiency and the quality of the generated samples. To allow a methodical evaluation, we introduce a new objective measure based on a squared Euclidean reconstruction error metric, to assess training performance in terms of speed, stability, and quality of generated samples.

Factors, such as atmospheric correction, climate conditions, seasonal effect, urban settings, substantially affect fractional impervious surface estimation. Their impacts, however, have not been well studied and documented. In this research, we performed direct and comprehensive examinations to explore the impacts of these factors on subpixel estimation when using an effective machine learning technique (Random Forest) and provided solutions to alleviate these influences. Four conclusions can be drawn based on the repeatable experiments in three study areas under different climate conditions (humid continental, tropical monsoon, and Mediterranean climates). First, the performance of subpixel urban impervious surface mapping using top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance imagery is comparable to, and even slightly better than, the surface reflectance imagery provided by U.S. Geological Services in all seasons and in all testing regions. Second, the effect of images with leaf-on/off season varies, and is contingent upon different climate regions. Specifically, humid continental areas may prefer the leaf-on imagery (e.g., summer), while the tropical monsoon and Mediterranean regions seem to favor the fall and winter imagery. Third, the overall estimation performance in the humid continental area is somewhat better than the other regions. Finally, improvements can be achieved by using multi-season imagery, but the increments become less obvious when including more than two seasons.

Decision Trees form the basis of many ensemble methods, such as Random Forests (RF) or Extremely Randomized Trees (ET). For these methods to work best, trees should be as large as possible. This challenges the data and the instruction cache of modern CPUs and thus demand a more careful memory layout. Based on a probabilistic view of decision tree execution, we optimize the two most common implementation schemes of decision trees. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both implementations and present a theoretically well-founded memory layout which maximizes locality during execution in both cases. The method is applied to three computer architectures, namely ARM (RISC), PPC (Extended RISC) and Intel (CISC) and is automatically adopted to the specific architecture by a code generator. We perform over 1800 experiments on several real-world data sets and report an average speed-up of 2 to 4 across all three architectures by using the proposed memory layout. Moreover, we find that our implementation outperforms sklearn, which was used to train the models by a factor of 1500.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICDM.2018.00017", "venue": "2018 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)", "journal": "2018 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2907415261", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["28895752", "14196694", "10344554", "40772241", "63785708", "214077805", "14106326", "12528622", "15502194", "40001016", "89141", "15137276", "7732239", "10844956", "14463568", "8758844", "88520060", "14518730", "6644398", "24813859", "6440708", "60915581", "125683267", "207226159", "8363937", "60282629", "1428702", "14928291", "10659969"], "inbound_citations": ["203437147"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52953359"}

There are two main ways to obtain elevation information: from active remote sensing systems, such as light detection and ranging (LIDAR), and from passive remote sensing systems, such as optical images, which allow the acquisition of stereo images for automatic digital surface models (DSMs) generation. Although airborne laser scanning provides very accurate DSMs, it is a costly method. On the other hand, the DSMs from stereo satellite imagery show a large coverage and lower costs. However, they are not as accurate as LIDAR DSMs. With respect to automatic 3D information extraction, the availability of accurate and detailed DSMs is a crucial issue for automatic 3D building model reconstruction. We present a novel methodology for generating a better-quality stereo DSM with refined buildings shapes using a deep learning framework.

However, current applications of MCMC techniques have been limited to several object models such as a lumpy object model and a binary texture model, and it remains unclear how MCMC methods can be implemented with other more sophisticated object models. Deep learning methods that employ generative adversarial networks (GANs) hold great promise to learn stochastic object models (SOMs) from image data. In this study, we described a method to approximate the IO by applying MCMC techniques to SOMs learned by use of GANs. The proposed method can be employed with arbitrary object models that can be learned by use of GANs, thereby the domain of applicability of MCMC techniques for approximating the IO performance is extended. In this study, both signal-known-exactly (SKE) and signal-known-statistically (SKS) binary signal detection tasks are considered.

Due to its special alloy and catalytic properties, the vanadium extraction industry is developing fast, resulting in several environmental problems. The vanadium extraction technology has begun to implement Cleaner Production technologies and practices to tackle environmental problems caused by the production process. However, Cleaner Production evaluation methodologies aimed at small samples have rarely been examined in the literature. This paper proposes data mining methods to the Cleaner Production evaluation system that enable decision-makers to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of Cleaner Production. We first completed the indicator framework and criteria of vanadium extraction industry using weak acid leaching. Then established the Cleaner Production assessment model aimed at small samples using Support Vector Machines optimization with Genetic Algorithm. According to the comparison in application, the Genetic Algorithm - Support Vector Machines method is more accurate and efficient than back-propagation artificial neural network. Moreover, performed sensitivity analysis on the input variables and put forward some policy suggestion on the most influencing parameters. As such, this study suggests an effective assessment method of small samples of CP and provides a guideline for enterprise management on the implementation of CP in the industry of vanadium extraction from stone coal.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.12.071", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Cleaner Production", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2565875508", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["199399730", "133311706", "92997214"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:113779505"}

Meanwhile, it is necessary for solar power prediction to capture these fluctuations several minutes ahead in order to facilitate scheduling and operations that maintain the system stability. Considering such importance of the cloud movement, sky images provided by all-sky cameras consist of important data for solar prediction. However, for solar predictors, raw sky images are usually too large to be directly used as the input data. Instead, the features in the sky images related to solar irradiance should be extracted and fed to the predictors. Hence, in this paper, we propose a transfer learning method to extract features from sky images with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to capture the close relationship between clouds and solar irradiance. To accomplish this goal, we first train a classifier on sky images to determine whether the sun is covered by clouds or not, where the classification accuracy achieved is as high as 97.92%. Then, the spectral and textural features of sky images are further extracted by the regression layers in CNN and a nonlinear relationship between sky images and the solar irradiance is revealed. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method can successfully map the sky images to solar irradiance and have significance for future solar prediction applications.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/PESGM40551.2019.8973423", "venue": "2019 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting (PESGM)", "journal": "2019 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting (PESGM)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3003168199", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["24250076", "126124836", "22260641", "126179160", "15608097", "3451696", "49730439", "11150367", "22107212", "2396025", "52158366", "3819513", "16081723", "42970087"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210991924"}

The main objective of this research was to develop a methodological framework to assess the impacts of climate change on seasonal drought characteristics with uncertainty. Bangladesh, one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change was considered as the study area for implementation of the framework. An ensemble of general circulation models (GCMs) of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) were used for downscaling and projection of rainfall and temperature under different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios. Two state of art data mining approaches known as Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were used for the development of downscaling models and Quantile Mapping (QM) approach was used to remove biases in GCMs. The observed and future projected rainfall data were used to characterize the seasonal droughts using Severity-Area-Frequency (SAF) curves developed for different climatic and major crop growing seasons. The results revealed superior performance of SVM in downscaling rainfall and temperature in tropical climate in terms of all standard statistics. Downscaling of CMIP5 GCMs projections revealed a change in annual average rainfall in Bangladesh in the range of -8.6% in the northeast to +11.9% in the northwest, which indicates that spatial distribution of rainfall of Bangladesh will be more homogeneous in future. The maximum and minimum temperatures of Bangladesh were projected to increase in the range of 0.8 to 4.3oC and 1.0 to 4.8oC, respectively under different RCPs.

A conditional graphical model, i.e., segmentation conditional random fields (SCRFs), is proposed as an effective solution to this problem. In contrast to traditional graphical models, such as the hidden Markov model (HMM), SCRFs follow a discriminative approach. Therefore, it is flexible to include any features in the model, such as overlapping or long-range interaction features over the whole sequence. The model also employs a convex optimization function, which results in globally optimal solutions to the model parameters. On the other hand, the segmentation setting in SCRFs makes their graphical structures intuitively similar to the protein 3-D structures and more importantly provides a framework to model the long-range interactions between secondary structures directly. Our model is applied to predict the parallel beta-helix fold, an important fold in bacterial pathogenesis and carbohydrate binding/cleavage. The cross-family validation shows that SCRFs not only can score all known beta-helices higher than non-beta-helices in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), but also accurately locates rungs in known beta-helix proteins. Our method outperforms BetaWrap, a state-of-the-art algorithm for predicting beta-helix folds, and HMMER, a general motif detection algorithm based on HMM, and has the additional advantage of general application to other protein folds.

Sentinel 2 is the newest satellite that has a high spatial resolution and a 10 day equator with one satellite, and 5 day equator with 2 satellites.

However, there is currently no system for tactical-level reasoning. Such a system should address tasks such as passing cars, making exits on time, and merging into a traffic stream. Many previous approaches have attempted to hand construct large rule-based systems which capture the interactions between multiple input sensors, dynamic and potentially conflicting subgoals, and changing roadway conditions. However, these systems are extremely difficult to design due to the large number of rules, the manual tuning of parameters within the rules, and the complex interactions between the rules. Our approach to this intermediate-level planning is a system which consists of a collection of autonomous agents, each of which specializes in a particular aspect of tactical driving. Each agent examines a subset of the intelligent vehicle\u2018s sensors and independently recommends driving decisions based on their local assessment of the tactical situation. This distributed framework allows different reasoning agents to be implemented using different algorithms. ::: ::: When using a collection of agents to solve a single task, it is vital to carefully consider the interactions between the agents. Since each reasoning object contains several internal parameters, manually finding values for these parameters while accounting for the agents\u2018 possible interactions is a tedious and error-prone task. In our system, these parameters, and the system\u2018s overall dependence on each agent, is automatically tuned using a novel evolutionary optimization strategy, termed Population-Based Incremental Learning (PBIL). ::: ::: Our system, which employs multiple automatically trained agents, can competently drive a vehicle, both in terms of the user-defined evaluation metric, and as measured by their behavior on several driving situations culled from real-life experience.

We then incorporate this boundary model into a mixture of multiscale conditional random fields, where the mixture components represent different contexts formed by clustering overall spatial distributions of boundaries across images and image regions (vistas).

Jazz is one of representative types of music, but the lack of Jazz data in the MIDI format hinders the construction of a generative model for Jazz. Transfer learning is an approach aiming to solve the problem of data insufficiency, so as to transfer the common feature from one domain to another. In view of its success in other machine learning problems, we investigate whether, and how much, it can help improve automatic music generation for under-resourced musical genres. Specifically, we use a recurrent variational autoencoder as the generative model, and use a genre-unspecified dataset as the source dataset and a Jazz-only dataset as the target dataset. Two transfer learning methods are evaluated using six levels of source-to-target data ratios. The first method is to train the model on the source dataset, and then fine-tune the resulting model parameters on the target dataset. The second method is to train the model on both the source and target datasets at the same time, but add genre labels to the latent vectors and use a genre classifier to improve Jazz generation. The evaluation results show that the second method seems to perform better overall, but it cannot take full advantage of the genre-unspecified dataset.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1908.09484", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/APSIPAASC47483.2019.9023224", "venue": "2019 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA ASC)", "journal": "2019 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA ASC)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2969833269,3010903955", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["2002865", "88510988", "1033682", "115408617", "3891811", "8822245", "9651443", "18876242", "1215640", "740063", "206592191", "7824159", "52967399", "4523279", "53258271", "197460482", "1407171", "2853891", "2157952", "53872628", "53873282", "198973682", "38716842"], "inbound_citations": ["209324251"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201666995"}

Remote sensing technology has been used to monitor net primary productivity (NPP) of ecological system for several years.

Firstly a new approach based on mixed pixels and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm were used to correct simulated NPP values derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Finally, spatial distribution and monthly variation characteristics of NPP in Qinghai Province in 2006 were analyzed in detail. The result showed that NPP of vegetation in Qinghai Province in 2006 ranged from 0 to 422 gC/m2/a and the average NPP was 151 gC/m2/a. NPP gradually increased from northwest to southeast. NPP of different vegetation types were obviously different. The average NPP of broad-leaved forest was the largest (314 gC/m2/a), and sparse shrub was the smallest (101 gC/m2/a). NPP in Qinghai Province significantly changed with seasonal variation. The accumulation of NPP was primarily in the period (from April to September) with better moist and heat conditions. In July, the average NPP of vegetation reached the maximum value (43 gC/m2).

For this reason, computational and machine learning procedures for biomarker discovery are important tools to consider, both to reduce data dimension and to provide predictive markers for specific diseases.

We do not simply see the photograph as a flat 2D surface, we perceive the 3D visual world captured in it, by using our imagination to inpaint the information lost during camera projection. We propose neural architectures that similarly learn to approximately imagine abstractions of the 3D world depicted in 2D images. We show that this capability suffices to localize moving objects in 3D, without using any human annotations. Our models are recurrent neural networks that consume RGB or RGB-D videos, and learn to predict novel views of the scene from queried camera viewpoints. They are equipped with a 3D representation bottleneck that learns an egomotion-stabilized and geometrically consistent deep feature map of the 3D world scene. They estimate camera motion from frame to frame, and cancel it from the extracted 2D features before fusing them in the latent 3D map. We handle multimodality and stochasticity in prediction using ranking-based contrastive losses, and show that they can scale to photorealistic imagery, in contrast to regression or VAE alternatives. Our model proposes 3D boxes for moving objects by estimating a 3D motion flow field between its temporally consecutive 3D imaginations, and thresholding motion magnitude: camera motion has been cancelled in the latent 3D space, and thus any non-zero motion is an indication of an independently moving object.

Today, the availability of access to real-time data streams makes fast and real-time classification of travel modes possible. Because of different characteristics of data streams, the applied classification method has to be adjusted to the particular data stream. In this paper two classification methods, k Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest, are compared with emphasis on accuracy. First, they are applied for classification of travel modes using a static GNSS dataset, and afterward using streaming GNSS data. For the purpose of classification, characteristic distribution of velocity and acceleration for different travel modes is determined.

Christiansen (mhc27@cornell.edu) Department of Psychology Cornell University Ithaca, NY 14853 USA Abstract How does the existence of case systems, and strict word order patterns a\u21b5ect the learnability of a given language? We present a series of connectionist sim- ulations, suggesting that both case and strict word order may facilitate syntactic acquisition by a se- quential learning device. Our results are consis- tent with typological data concerning the frequen- cies with which di\u21b5erent type of word order pat- terns occur across the languages of the world. Our model also accommodates patterns of syntactic de- velopment across several di\u21b5erent languages. We conclude that non-linguistic constraints on general sequential-learning devices may help explain the re- lationship between case, word order, and learnabil- ity of individual languages. Introduction In language acquisition, children are faced with many formidable tasks, yet they normally acquire most of their native language within the first five years of life. One of the most difficult of these tasks involves mapping a sequence of words onto some sort of interpretation of what that sequence is supposed to mean. That is, in order for the child to under- stand a sentence, she needs to determine the gram- matical roles of the individual words so that she can work out who did what to whom. Although the chil- dren appear to bring powerful statistical learning mechanisms to bear on the acquisition tasks (e.g., Sa\u21b5ran, Aslin, & Newport 1996), the existence of linguistic universals common across radically di\u21b5er- ent languages (Greenberg 1963) points to the pres- ence of innate constraints on such learning. Without such constraints, it becomes difficult to explain why there are few, if any, Object-Subject-Verb (OSV) languages (van Everbroeck, 1999) even though in principle such a language appears to be as good as any other. In this paper, we propose that these con- straints may arise from non-linguistic limitations on the sequential learning of statistical structure, and examine how this perspective may shed light on how children learn to map the words in sentences onto their appropriate grammatical roles. There are two major ways in which languages signal syntactic rela- tionships and grammatical roles\u2014word order (WO), and case markings. In a strict WO language like En- glish, declarative sentences follow a Subject-Verb- Object (SVO) pattern. It is the occurrence of the subject in the first position, and the object in the second, that allows the hearer to comprehend who did what to whom. In contrast, languages such as Russian or Japanese allow multiple word orders and rely on case markings to disambiguate subjects from objects. For instance, Masha lubit Petyoo (SVO), Petyoo lubit Masha (OVS), and Lubit Petyoo Masha (VOS) are all grammatical in Russian and all mean Mary loves Peter (albeit with di\u21b5erent emphases on the constituents), due to the nominative -a, and ac- cusative -u case markers. While long-standing theories describe acquisition of language through an innate language acquisition device (e.g., Pinker, 1995), an alternative approach that is gaining ground is the adaptation of linguistic structures to the human brain rather than vice versa (e.g., Christiansen, 1994; Kirby, 1998). On this ac- count, language universals may reflect non-linguistic cognitive constraints on learning and processing of sequential structure, rather than constraints pre- scribed by an innate universal grammar. Previ- ous work has shown that sequential-learning devices with no language-specific biases are better able to learn more universal aspects of language as com- pared to aspects encountered in rare languages (e.g., Ellefson & Christiansen, 2000; Christiansen & De- vlin, 1997; Van Everbroeck, 1999, 2001). Here, we examine the ways in which case markings and word order may function as cues for a sequen- tial learning device acquiring syntactic structure. In simulation 1, we model di\u21b5erent word orders, and hypothesize that typologically common languages should be easier to learn by a sequential-learning device than the more rare ones. We expand on this idea in simulation 2 by studying the performance of networks trained on languages of varying degrees of case markings and flexibility. Finally, in simulation 3, we establish that our trained networks are able to mimic syntactic performance of children learn- ing English, Italian, Turkish, and Serbo-Croatian (Slobin and Bever, 1982).", "year": 2002, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4324/9781315782379-138", "venue": "In Proceedings of the 24th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2768244601", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["145637092", "2055800", "10089159", "2675113", "126122110", "157837123", "183684003", "55605532", "25864904", "120789232"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5759479"}

We compiled a data set for 331 drivers completing 7332 trips over 21 routes to obtain evidence of the impact of route, payload and driver behaviour on fuel economy. We then extracted various regression and neural models for fuel economy and used these models to remove the impact of route inclination and payload, allowing the impact of driver performance to be measured more accurately. All models demonstrated significant out-of-sample predictive ability.

A key enabling technology for forming networks over white spaces is distributed spectrum measurements to identify and assess the quality of unused channels. This spectrum availability data is often aggregated at a central base station or database to govern the usage of spectrum. This process is vulnerable to integrity violations if the devices are malicious and misreport spectrum sensing results. In this paper we propose CUSP, a new technique based on machine learning that uses a trusted initial set of signal propagation data in a region as input to build a classifier using Support Vector Machines. The classifier is subsequently used to detect integrity violations. Using classification eliminates the need for arbitrary assumptions about signal propagation models and parameters or thresholds in favor of direct training data.

The decentralized nature of ZigBee ad-hoc networks creates unique security challenges for maintaining network security and intrusion detection. RF-fingerprinting provides a unique physical (PHY) layer defense against node counterfeiting by identifying rogue devices through their RF-emissions. In previous work, feature generation from received RF signals was accomplished with parametric variables such as standard deviation, variance, skewness, and kurtosis, all based on the assumption of a normal distribution of a particular region of interest. We show in this work that most collected signals are either multi-modal or non-parametric. Use of non-parametric methods for feature generation such as mean, median, mode, and trend represented by linear model coefficient estimates are shown to be much more applicable to the non-parametric distribution of the collected ZigBee preamble, resulting in improved classification performance of devices.

Identifying such galaxies within the planned survey footprint of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)---before a transient is detected---will make TDE classification immediate and follow-up more efficient. Unfortunately, spectra for identifying most such galaxies are unavailable, and simple photometric selection is ineffective; cutting on\"green valley\"UV/optical/IR colors produces samples that are highly contaminated and incomplete. Here we propose a new strategy using only photometric optical/UV/IR data from large surveys. Applying a machine learning Random Forest classifier to a sample of ~400k SDSS galaxies with GALEX and WISE photometry, including 13,592 quiescent Balmer-strong galaxies, we achieve 53-61% purity and 8-21% completeness, given the range in redshift. For the subset of 1299 post-starburst galaxies, we achieve 63-73% purity and 5-12% completeness. Given these results, the range of likely TDE and supernova rates, and that 36-75% of TDEs occur in quiescent Balmer-strong hosts, we estimate that 13-99% of transients observed in photometrically-selected host galaxies will be TDEs and that we will discover 119-248 TDEs per year with LSST. Using our technique, we present a new catalog of 67,484 candidate galaxies expected to have a high TDE rate, drawn from the SDSS, Pan-STARRS, DES, and WISE photometric surveys.

Also, there is an evident increase of the size of the damages caused by these hazards. B\u00e2sca Chiojdului River Basin is one of the most affected areas in Romania by flash-flood phenomena. Therefore, Flash-Flood Potential Index (FFPI) was defined and calculated across the B\u00e2sca Chiojdului river basin by using one bivariate statistical method (Statistical Index) and its novel ensemble with the following machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Classification and Regression Trees, Multilayer Perceptron, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree CART. In a first stage, the areas with torrentiality were digitized based on orthophotomaps and field observations. These regions, together with an equal number of non-torrential pixels, were further divided into training surfaces (70%) and validating surfaces (30%). The next step of the analysis consisted of the selection of flash-flood conditioning factors based on the multicollinearity investigation and predictive ability estimation through Information Gain method. Eight factors, from a total of ten flash-floods predictors, were selected in order to be included in the FFPI calculation process. By applying the models represented by Statistical Index and its ensemble with the machine learning algorithms, the weight of each conditioning factor and of each factor class/category in the FFPI equations was established. Once the weight values were derived, the FFPI values across the B\u00e2sca Chiojdului river basin were calculated by overlaying the flash-flood predictors in GIS environment. According to the results obtained, the central part of B\u00e2sca Chiojdului river basin has the highest susceptibility to flash-flood phenomena. Thus, around 30% of the study site has high and very high values of FFPI. The results validation was carried out by applying the Prediction Rate and Success Rate.

Artificial intelligence (AI) models were generated using Pentacam HR (Oculus, Wetzlar, Germany) parameters to discriminate the preoperative data of 3 groups: stable laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) cases (2980 patients with minimum follow-up of 7 years), ectasia susceptibility (71 eyes of 45 patients that developed post-LASIK ectasia [PLE]), and clinical keratoconus (KC; 182 patients). Model accuracy was independently tested in a different set of stable LASIK cases (298 patients with minimum follow-up of 4 years) and in 188 unoperated patients with very asymmetric ectasia (VAE); these patients presented normal topography (VAE-NT) in 1 eye and clinically diagnosed ectasia in the other (VAE-E). Accuracy was evaluated with ROC curves. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The random forest (RF) provided highest accuracy among AI models in this sample with 100% sensitivity for clinical ectasia (KC+VAE-E; cutoff 0.52), being named Pentacam Random Forest Index (PRFI). Considering all cases, the PRFI had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.992 (94.2% sensitivity, 98.8% specificity; cutoff 0.216), being statistically higher than the Belin/Ambr\u00f3sio deviation (BAD-D; AUC = 0.960, 87.3% sensitivity, 97.5% specificity; P = .006, DeLong's test). The optimized cutoff of 0.125 provided sensitivity of 85.2% for VAE-NT and 80% for PLE, with 96.6% specificity. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: The PRFI enhances ectasia diagnosis.

Using this pipeline, we detected 3,472 novel RIs from 18 RNA-Seq datasets and re-confirmed 1,384 RIs which are currently annotated in the TAIR10 database. We also use the expression of intron-containing isoforms as a new feature in addition to the conventional features. Based on these features, RIs are highly distinguishable from CSIs by machine learning methods, especially when the expressional odds of retention (i.e., the expression ratio of the RI-containing isoforms relative to the isoforms without RIs for the same gene) reaches to or larger than 50/50. In this case, the RIs and CSIs can be clearly separated by the Random Forest with an outstanding performance of 0.95 on AUC (the area under a receiver operating characteristics curve). The closely related characteristics to the RIs include the low strength of splice sites, high similarity with the flanking exon sequences, low occurrence percentage of YTRAY near the acceptor site, existence of putative intronic splicing silencers (ISSs, i.e., AG/GA-rich motifs) and intronic splicing enhancers (ISEs, i.e., TTTT-containing motifs), and enrichment of Serine/Arginine-Rich (SR) proteins and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoparticle proteins (hnRNPs).", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5640774", "pubmed_id": "29062321", "doi": "10.3389/fpls.2017.01728", "venue": "Front.

In regression-based statistical downscaling processes, there are different sources of uncertainty arising from high-dimensionality of atmospheric predictors, nonlinearity of empirical and quantitative models, and the biases exist in climate model simulations. To reduce the influence of these sources of uncertainty, the current study presents a comprehensive methodology to improve projection of precipitation in the Zayandeh-Rud basin in Iran as an illustrative study. To reduce dimensionality of atmospheric predictors and capture nonlinearity between the target variable and predictors in each station, a supervised-PCA method is combined with two soft-computing machine-learning methods, Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM). Three statistical transformation methods are also employed to correct biases in atmospheric large-scale predictors. The developed models are then employed on outputs of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) multimodal dataset to project future behavior of precipitation under three climate changes scenarios.

Essentially, the proposed DQS adopts a single shrinkage threshold to obtain a simple quantization scheme, which adapts its outputs to input data density. With this quantization scheme, a large data set is quantized to a small subset where considerable sample size reduction is generally obtained. In particular, the sample size reduction can save significant computational cost when using the quantized subset for feature approximation via the Nystrom method. Based on the quantized subset, the approximated features are incorporated into LS-SVM to develop a data density-dependent quantized LS-SVM (DQLS-SVM), where an analytic solution is obtained in the primal solution space.

In the last decade, studies in affective Brain-Computer Interfaces (aBCI) have increased especially in the discipline of affective computing. One of the topics is fuzzy classification of human emotions. Fuzzy set theory has been applied due to its potential benefit of human comprehensibility. Furthermore, the approach exhibits shorter computation time and it is faster than other machine learning techniques if it has only a number of manageable rules. It is also suitable for online applications. However, it is important to have an efficient means for extracting appropriate rules. In this study, it is proposed to use Fuzzy C-Mean (FCM) for extracting fuzzy rules to be used in the fuzzy inference system (FIS) for classification purpose.

Existing weed detection techniques does not yield better performance due to the complex background and illumination variation.

To overcome this drawback, this paper proposes a novel Angular Texture Pattern (ATP) Extraction Method for crop and weed discrimination using curvelet transformation. In our proposed work, Adaptive Median Filter (AMF) is used for filtering the impulse noise from the image. Plant image identification is performed using green pixel extraction and K-means clustering. Wrapping based Curvelet transform is applied to the plant image. Feature extraction is performed to extract the angular texture pattern of the plant image. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based Differential Evolution Feature Selection (DEFS) approach is applied to select the optimal features. Then, the selected features are learned and passed through an RVM based classifier to find out the weed. Edge detection and contouring is performed to identify the weed in the plant image. Fuzzy rule-based approach is applied to detect the low, medium and high levels of the weed patchiness. From the experimental results, it is clearly observed that the accuracy of the proposed approach is higher than the existing Support Vector Machine (SVM) based approaches.

Therefore, integrating the microfacies sequences into permeability modeling became a crucial to obtain accurate prediction and then improve the overall reservoir characterization. The discrete microfacies distribution leads to distinct regression lines given each microfacies type. Therefore, the Random Forest (RF) algorithm was considered in this paper for microfacies classification and Smooth Generalized Additive Modeling (sGAM) was considered for permeability modeling as a function of well logging data and the predicted discrete microfacies distribution. The well logging records that were incorporated into the microfacies classification and permeability modeling: SP, ILD and density porosity logs. These two approaches were adopted in a well in a sandstone reservoir, located in East Texas basin. The effectiveness of using RF and sGAM approaches was investigated by their performance to handle wide ranges of data given the five microfacies types. More specifically, the Random Forest Modeling was super accurate to predict the microfacies distribution at the missing intervals for the same well and other wells. Moreover, the sGAM resulted to obtain accurate modeling and prediction of permeability in high and low permeable intervals.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3997/2214-4609.201902189", "venue": "Petroleum Geostatistics 2019", "journal": "Petroleum Geostatistics 2019", "mag_id": "2969665654", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202178846"}

In this paper we circumvent this problem by focusing on parsing the content of both the input text and the synthesized image thoroughly to model the text-to-image consistency in the semantic level. In particular, we design a memory structure to parse the textual content by exploring semantic correspondence between each word in the vocabulary to its various visual contexts across relevant images in training data during text encoding. On the other hand, the synthesized image is parsed to learn its semantics in an object-aware manner. Moreover, we customize a conditional discriminator, which models the fine-grained correlations between words and image sub-regions to push for the cross-modality semantic alignment between the input text and the synthesized image. Thus, a full-spectrum content-oriented parsing in the deep semantic level is performed by our model, which is referred to as Content-Parsing Generative Adversarial Networks (CPGAN).

Results show that LS-SVM can achieve good accuracy and faster speed than neural network methods.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TMAG.2010.2087743", "venue": "Digests of the 2010 14th Biennial IEEE Conference on Electromagnetic Field Computation", "journal": "Digests of the 2010 14th Biennial IEEE Conference on Electromagnetic Field Computation", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2126039133", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:22145101"}

Detection of obstruction and its grading is very essential. Obstruction in the airways, forces the accessory muscles like sternomastoid muscle (SMM) of respiration to work. Normally, only essential muscles of respiration work. In the said paper electromyographic (EMG) analysis of SMM is done for COPD and Normal subjects. We have developed improved slope based onset detection algorithm to detect the onset and offset timing of EMG. Time domain features are extracted for COPD and normal subject. The onset detection algorithm reduces the number of computations by 32.96% and increases accuracy of feature calculation by 40.19%. Dominant time domain features are selected and applied to Support Vector Machine Classifier. The SVM classification algorithm is compared with Threshold and Naive Bayes classification algorithm. SVM gives the highest accuracy of 87.80%, sensitivity of 89.65% and specificity of 83.33%. Results are also compared with previously used FEV1/FEV6 and Forced Oscillation Technique. The activity of SMM has a significant role in the classification of Normal and COPD subject. Further analysis of SMM can be done to find different grades of COPD.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jksuci.2017.05.006", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences", "mag_id": "2614152541", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["21441367", "122328365"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:79552485"}

Traditional pattern recognition and classification system usually suffers huge performance variation due to patient specificity and algorithm inadaptability. To address this problem, we propose a two stage seizure detection system which integrates off-line channel selection and feature selection before the construction of the final model. This system allows patient specific channel selection and flexible feature set extraction for individual patient, so that a more compact and reliable model could be developed. Employing the two stage scheme not only decreases hardware cost in signal readout and feature extraction, but also remarkably improves detection sensitivity and reduces false detections. Mutual information based method is used for channel selection, while Random Forests and nonlinear SVM-RFE are evaluated for feature selection. The whole system achieves a mean detection latency of 6 seconds and a false detection rate of 0.356 per hour. Based on the test dataset, the sensitivity is found to 74.2% by sample or 98.4% by record with only two detection misses. Our design is also hardware-friendly, which could be implemented as a single chip closed loop neural modulation system.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29060580", "doi": "10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037539", "venue": "Conference proceedings : ...
