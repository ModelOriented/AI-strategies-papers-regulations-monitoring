Furthermore, the computational load of using a large number of classifiers can make its application extremely expensive. ::: ::: In this work, we present a method for building Random Forests that use Very Fast Decision Trees for data streams on GPUs. We show how this method can benefit from the massive parallel architecture of GPUs, which are becoming an efficient hardware alternative to large clusters of computers. Moreover, our algorithm minimizes the communication between CPU and GPU by building the trees directly inside the GPU.

Therefore, such word-based CTC model can only recognize the frequent words modeled by the network output nodes. It also cannot easily handle the hot-words which emerge after the model is trained. In this study, we improve the acoustic-to-word model with a hybrid CTC model which can predict both words and characters at the same time. With a shared-hidden-layer structure and modular design, the alignments of words generated from the word-based CTC and the character-based CTC are synchronized. Whenever the acoustic-to-word model emits an OOV token, we back off that OOV segment to the word output generated from the character-based CTC, hence solving the OOV or hot-words issue.

In the contrast learning step, all the samples in the 3D object dataset are cut into two parts and put into a \"part\" dataset. Then a contrast learning GCNN (ContrastNet) is trained to verify whether two randomly sampled parts from the part dataset belong to the same object. In the cluster learning step, the trained ContrastNet is applied to all the samples in the original 3D object dataset to extract features, which are used to group the samples into clusters. Then another GCNN for clustering learning (ClusterNet) is trained from the orignal 3D data to predict the cluster IDs of all the training samples. The contrasting learning forces the ContrastNet to learn semantic features of objects, while the ClusterNet improves the quality of learned features by being trained to discover objects that belong to the same semantic categories by using cluster IDs.

In addition, a novel model is developed for extracting features based on static, behavioral and network analysis using analysis report generated by the Cuckoo Sandbox. Weka Framework is used to develop machine learning models by using training datasets. The experimental results using proposed framework shows high detection rate with an accuracy of 100% using J48 Decision tree model, 99% using SMO (Sequential Minimal Optimization) and 97% using Random Forest tree. It also shows effective classification rate with accuracy 100% using J48 Decision tree, 91% using SMO and 66% using Random Forest tree. These results are used for detecting and classifying unknown files as benign or malicious.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3136825.3136883", "venue": "SIN '17", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2784813287", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3097210", "7090674", "62468401", "17491587", "206600254", "18272895"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2927760"}

In this paper, we propose a method for the extraction of cell nuclei from HaE stained biopsies robust enough to deal with the full range of histological grades observed in daily clinical practice. The robustness is achieved by combining a wide range of information including color, texture, scale and geometry in a multi-stage, Support Vector Machine (SVM) based framework to replace the original image with a new, probabilistic image modality with stable characteristics. The actual extraction of the nuclei is performed from the new image using Mark Point Processes (MPP), a state-of-the-art stochastic method. An empirical evaluation on clinical data provided and annotated by pathologists shows that our method greatly improves detection and extraction results, and provides a reliable solution with high grade cancers.

Together with RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC), hybridization between the mature miRNAs (typically about 22 nucleotides long ncRNAs) and the 3' untranslated regions of its targets mRNAs post-transcriptionally downregulate potentially a multitude of target genes. Recently reported in human and animals, host miRNAs can constitutively inhibit [3] or promote [4] viral replication. In parallels, viruses have devised counter-defensive strategies using virus-encoded RNAi suppressors [5] and/or virus-encoded miRNAs [6,7] to alter the cellular miRNA milieu in ways beneficial for their viral replication. The detailed mechanism of viral miRNAs involved in disabling/hijacking the host defense is still largely unknown. The endeavor towards elucidating the complex viral/human miRNAs-target interactions is technically challenging as high-throughput experimental methods for identifying viral miRNAs and human mRNA targets are yet available. To date there are few experimentally validated viral miRNAs and even fewer viral/human miRNAs-target interactions, there remain many unanswered questions about the mechanism and degree of down-regulation. As a first step towards understanding the complex viral/human miRNAs-target interactions, we have developed a computational pipeline for identifying novel viral miRNAs. It combines (1) knowledge of miRNAs biogenesis whereby mature miRNAs originate from one arm of asymmetric stem-loop RNA structures known as the precursor miRNAs, (2) windowing and RNA structural folding along the viral genomic sequences for screening all potential precursor miRNAs, and (3) employing Support Vector Machine (an advanced machine-learning algorithm) to distinguish the real precursor miRNAs from pseudo hairpins.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "88634940", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:80923076"}

They have been proposed for a very long time to capture multi-attribute contrasts between data classes or trends over time. A study carried out in this work shows that Emerging Patterns, as it is formulated to date, has several deficiencies and limitations to face classification problems. Different approaches based on this previous and deficient formulation of Emerging Patterns have been proposed in the literature. These different approaches have been created showing that, despite these limitations, have very high predictive power. These approaches range from classifiers directly built on Emerging Patterns to instance-weighting schemes for weighted Support Vector Machines. In this work, a new formulation for Emerging Patterns, which is completely aimed at dealing with classification problems, is proposed.A new classifier and a new instance-weighting scheme have also been created based on the novel formulation. They have been created to prove the advantages of this novel formulation handling classification problems over the previous formulation. An empirical study carried out on benchmark datasetsfrom the UCI Machine Learning Repository shows that the proposed classifieris superior to other state-of-the-art classification methods such as C4.5, NaiveBayes. It has also shown to be superior to all of the most representative EPbased classifiers, based on the previous and deficient formulation, in terms of overall predictive accuracy in almost all of the used databases. The created instance-weighting scheme has been also empirically compared with the previous related works outperforming them in most of the cases.In addition to these empirical studies about the predictive power of the new formulation,a second set of studies has also been carried out. This second set of studies was made to show some other interesting features of the novel formulation.These other interesting features are, for instance, the number of patterns required to do a decent classification job or the robustness of the created classifierbased on the new version of Emerging Patterns. These other features, in addition to the overall predictive accuracy, could also be determinant in the selection of the appropriate classifier for some specific classification problems. It is this way because, in very typical situations, there could be some classification constraints such as the available computational power or, for instance, the time to classify a test instance could be limited. The raise in overall predictive accuracy as well as the other results could be considered as clear proofs of the advantages of the novel formulation handling classification problems. To finish, drafts of some possible future works based on the proposed formulation of Emerging Patterns are also given, describing them in some detail.

Automatic objective assessment can serve as a useful tool for diagnosis of pathological voices. Acoustic analysis can be useful in determining severity of dysphonia. The present study aimed to develop a complementary automatic voice assessment system by using multidimensional acoustical measures based on the well-known GRBAS perceptual rating scale. A total of 65 dimensionality measures including traditional acoustic methods, MFCC, Glottal-to-Noise Excitation Methods and nonlinear dynamical analysis were used to compose a matrix of features. To reduce redundancy in features, four different feature extraction techniques were applied. The multiclass classification was carried out by means of RBF kernel-SVM and Extreme Learning Machine. The classification results were moderately correlated with GRBAS ratings of severity, with the best accuracy around 77.55 and 80.58 %, respectively.

However, before we can achieve this goal of personalized insight about an individual, we have to resolve a number of shortcomings: 1) wearable-sensory time series is often of variable-length and incomplete due to different data collection periods (e.g., wearing behavior varies by person); 2) inter-individual variability to external factors like stress and environment. This paper addresses these challenges and brings us closer to the potential of personalized insights whether about health or personality or job performance about an individual by developing a novel representation learning algorithm, HeartSpace. Specifically, HeartSpace is capable of encoding time series data with variable-length and missing values via the integration of a time series encoding module and a pattern aggregation network. Additionally, HeartSpace implements a Siamese-triplet network to optimize representations by jointly capturing intra- and inter-series correlations during the embedding learning process.

Using a suite of representative real-world datasets, we find a systematic bias in predictions from random forest models. We find that this bias is recapitulated in simple synthetic datasets, regardless of whether or not they include irreducible error (noise) in the data, but that models employing boosting do not exhibit this bias.

It is an iterative algorithm that combines simple parameterized functions with weak performance (high prediction error) in order to produce a highly accurate prediction by minimizing the errors [1]. Therefore, this paper investigates the application of gradient boosting algorithm in Generalised Linear Model (GLM) and Generalised Additive Models (GAM) to produce better prediction using Munich rental data. More interestingly, to compare the performance of classical GLM and GAM and their corresponding boosted packages in prediction. However, in boosting algorithm, optimum-boosting iterations are highly recommended to avoid over fitting. It plays an important role when the fitting model, we, therefore, employ the use of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) based technique to determine the appropriate boosting iteration that gives the optimum prediction.

The generation of wind power as renewable energy has been rapidly growing around the world. Undoubtedly wind energy is unlimited in potential.

To cope with this, many works have been done for wind speed and power forecasting. It is reported that, compared with physical persistent models, statistical techniques and computational methods are more useful for short-term forecasting of wind power. Among them, support vector regression (SVR) has much attention in the literature. This paper proposes an SVR based wind speed forecasting.

The diagnosis of PFPS is difficult since the exact biomechanical factors and the extent to which they are affected by the disorder are still unknown. Recent research has reported significant statistical differences in ground reaction forces (GRFs) and foot kinematics, which could be indicative of PFPS, but the interrelationship between many of these measures and the pathology have been absent so far. In this paper, we applied the support vector machines (SVMs) to detect PFPS gait based on 14 GRF and 16 foot kinematic features recorded from 27 subjects (14 healthy and 13 with PFPS). The influence of combined gait parameters on classification performance was investigated through the use of a feature-selection algorithm. The optimal feature set was then compared against the most statistically significant individual features (p < 0.05) found by previous study. Test results indicated that GRF features alone resulted in a higher leave-one-out (LOO) classification accuracy (85.15%) compared to 74.07% using only kinematic features. A hill-climbing feature-selection algorithm was applied to determine the subset of combined kinematic and kinetic features, which provided optimal classifier performance. This subset, which consists of six features (two from GRF and four from foot kinematic features), provided an improved LOO accuracy of 88.89% . The optimal feature set detected by the SVM, which best identified gait characteristics of PFPS, was found to be closely related to inferential statistical analysis with the added distinction that the SVM could potentially be deployed as an automated system for detecting gait changes in patients with PFPS.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "19447723", "doi": "10.1109/TITB.2009.2022927", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2153631798", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["3253629", "31430113", "20808827", "35758525", "46211363", "45188752", "68617173", "24175043", "8974716", "35644334", "45176346", "29597854", "45734325", "24184707", "7097961", "21990479", "17902192", "33916919", "7666742", "2935780", "17156155", "19642140", "7138354", "60577818", "64543020", "19476631", "37681879", "379259", "30763073", "24424321", "29821683", "16067103", "35372852"], "inbound_citations": ["34154726", "25036144", "38176166", "215061372", "15923141", "4899951", "16343897", "4903690", "110949954", "30598302", "198116302", "55085713", "1992450", "86402958", "11262970", "67874135", "7527134", "3836645", "26139090", "62550753", "13407016", "7057402", "14283364", "3712973", "51714899", "208625051", "9524243", "210859485", "35344952", "21905"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16088390"}

Secondly, the vital signs data is converted into text information by Piecewise Approximate Aggregation (PAA) and Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX), then Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model is used to extract text topics of patients for heart failure prediction. Thirdly, the vital sign monitoring time series data of the surgical patient is converted into a grid image by using the grid representation, and then the convolutional neural network is directly used to identify the grid image for heart failure prediction. We evaluated the proposed methods in the monitoring data of real patients during the perioperative period. In this paper, the results of our experiment demonstrate the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) classifier achieves the best results in the prediction of heart failure by statistical feature representation. The sensitivity, specificity and the area under the curve (AUC) of the best method can reach 83, 85 and 84% respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that representation learning model of vital signs monitoring data of intraoperative patients can effectively capture the physiological characteristics of postoperative heart failure.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6902523", "pubmed_id": "31818298", "doi": "10.1186/s12911-019-0978-6", "venue": "BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making", "journal": "BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2996259876", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14850967", "19413328", "36319044", "206859035", "237387", "15005944", "3763233", "36065039", "3928156", "18388820", "16568831", "7203290", "6386756", "7932225", "15706973", "13252401", "269038", "2355296", "52195012", "52106748", "6084733", "3177797", "70209477", "206592218", "21211516"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208952437"}

We propose a new regularization method that minimizes the discrepancy between domain-specific latent feature representations directly in the hidden activation space. Although some standard distribution matching approaches exist that can be interpreted as the matching of weighted sums of moments, e.g. Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), an explicit order-wise matching of higher order moments has not been considered before. We propose to match the higher order central moments of probability distributions by means of order-wise moment differences. Our model does not require computationally expensive distance and kernel matrix computations. We utilize the equivalent representation of probability distributions by moment sequences to define a new distance function, called Central Moment Discrepancy (CMD). We prove that CMD is a metric on the set of probability distributions on a compact interval. We further prove that convergence of probability distributions on compact intervals w.r.t. the new metric implies convergence in distribution of the respective random variables. We test our approach on two different benchmark data sets for object recognition (Office) and sentiment analysis of product reviews (Amazon reviews).

In Potter Cove, King George Island (Isla 25 de Mayo), Antarctica, suspended particulate matter (SPM) from glacial melting leads to shading of photosynthetic light during the summer growth season, with predictable effects on macroalgal bed extension on newly ice-free areas inside the cove. The R-package \u2017biomod2\u2018 includes 10 different species distribution models (SDM) and 10 different evaluation methods to predict species or community occurrence based on statistical relationships with environmental conditions. In this study, we applied \u2017biomod2\u2018 to macroalgae presence and absence data to test the suitability of SDMs and to assess the environmental response of macroalgae to glacial retreat. Four different scenarios of distribution shifts were modeled assuming different SPM conditions for varying climate change scenarios. According to the averaged evaluation scores of relative operating characteristics (ROC) and true scale statistics (TSS) by the models applied, those methods based on a multitude of decision trees such as Random Forest and Classification Tree Analysis, reached the highest predictive ability followed by generalized boosted models (GBM) and maximum-entropy approaches (MAXENT). The final ensemble model (EM) used 135 of 200 calculated models (TSS > 0.7) and identified hard substrate and SPM as the best predictors explaining more than 60 % of the distribution. These variables were followed by distance to glacier, total organic carbon (TOC), bathymetry and slope. The modeled present status of macroalgae spatial distribution in this study results in only 18.25 % of visually estimated areas colonized by macroalgae in Potter Cove. We coupled the EM with changing SPM conditions representing an increase of melt water input to model the light condition niche of macroalgae in Potter Cove and its potential response to projected climate change. Under the climate change scenario of 25% increasing SPM the suitability for macroalgae may decrease up to 38%. Reduction in light condition suitability will be most severe in biodiversity hotspots such as polar shelf areas. Our results identify hotspots for macroalgae under climate change. The change in their habitats and accompanying biodiversity also could serve for posing challenges to conservation actions.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2805913199", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:133789247"}

The nonlinear mathematical expression of the reference function based 3D FLC is derived, and spatial fuzzy basis functions are defined. Via relating spatial fuzzy basis functions of a 3D FLC to kernel functions of an SVR, an equivalence relationship between a 3D FLC and an SVR is established. Therefore, a 3D FLC can be constructed using the learned results of an SVR.

This criterion is based on the logical compatibility between the input inquiry, translated into the formal language, and the domain, encoded in the same language. Inquiry generality is measured as a normalized number of object tuples, which deliver the translation satisfaction for a given domain. Computational experiments in various domains show that the certain diapason of generality indicates the proper translation. Specific heuristics are developed for the transformation of the translation formula to improve the value of the generality criterion. Usually, if the generality is too high (there is a large number of the tuples of objects) then the semantic analyzer has likely ignored some syntactic constraints for the translation formula. On the contrary, when the generality is too low (there is no object tuples, satisfying the translation), then the semantic analyzer has likely introduced too many syntactic constraints, and some of them have to be eliminated. Generality criterion helps in the frequent situations, where the morphological and syntactic processing is insufficient for the construction of the proper inquiry translation into the formal language. Our approach is based on the experimentally verified fact that the user poses inquiries with the reasonable generality. This knowledge helps us to improve the semantic analysis to function in the flexible and expandable domains, where the lexical information is rather limited. Compatibility feedback by means of generality control poses the specific requirements to the formal language of inquiry translation and domain knowledge representation. The semantic processor is implemented as a logical program with metalanguage support to present the complex semantic rules.

First, we propose an efficient representation of malware behaviors based on a key observation that the logical ordering of an application's actions over time often reveals the malicious intent even when each action alone may appear harmless. Then, we generate a database of malicious behavior signatures by studying more than 25 distinct families of mobile viruses and worms targeting the Symbian OS - the most widely-deployed handset OS - and their variants. Next, we propose a two-stage mapping technique that constructs these signatures at run-time from the monitored system events and API calls in Symbian OS. We discriminate the malicious behavior of malware from the normal behavior of applications by training a classifier based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Our evaluation on both simulated and real-world malware samples indicates that behavioral detection can identify current mobile viruses and worms with more than 96% accuracy.

Performances of RVM are analyzed and validated using typical classification examples and then RVM is applied to fault diagnosis of transformer. The RVM-based fault diagnosis of transformer is described in detail. The method takes normalized transformer feather gases content as inputs.

To accomplish this, we constructed Random Forest regression models to estimate sub-pixel urban percentage for 2001 and 2010 using high quality calibration information derived from Landsat data. Separate models were built for temperate and tropical regions and then evaluated for nine cities between 18,000 and 31,000 km 2 in area.

Tests of different input feature sets showed that including data from downscaled MODIS 500 m bands and nighttime lights can improve estimates of urban land area compared to using MODIS 250 m features alone.

During the last two decades, otolith chemical signatures (or \"fingerprints\") have been increasingly used as tools to discriminate between coastal habitats. However, correct assessment of fish origin from otolith fingerprints depends on various environmental and methodological parameters, including the choice of the statistical method used to assign fish to unknown origin. Among the available methods of classification, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is the most frequently used, although it assumes data are multivariate normal with homogeneous within-group dispersions, conditions that are not always met by otolith chemical data, even after transformation. Other less constrained classification methods are available, but there is a current lack of comparative analysis in applications to otolith microchemistry. Here, we assessed stock identification accuracy for four classification methods (LDA, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis [QDA], Random Forests [RF], and Artificial Neural Networks [ANN]), through the use of three distinct data sets. In each case, all possible combinations of chemical elements were examined to identify the elements to be used for optimal accuracy in fish assignment to their actual origin. Our study shows that accuracy differs according to the model and the number of elements considered. Best combinations did not include all the elements measured, and it was not possible to define an ad hoc multielement combination for accurate site discrimination. Among all the models tested, RF and ANN performed best, especially for complex data sets (e. g., with numerous fish species and/or chemical elements involved). However, for these data, RF was less time-consuming and more interpretable than ANN, and far more efficient and less demanding in terms of assumptions than LDA or QDA. Therefore, when LDA and QDA assumptions cannot be reached, the use of machine learning methods, such as RF, should be preferred for stock assessment and nursery identification based on otolith microchemistry, especially when data set include multispecific otolith signatures and/or many chemical elements.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "21774435", "doi": "10.1890/09-1887.1", "venue": "Ecological applications : a publication of the Ecological Society of America", "journal": "Ecological applications : a publication of the Ecological Society of America", "mag_id": "2076584060", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["83829606", "44284383", "215142547", "210138648", "208284310", "89706524", "182829534", "214867560", "160473", "214846909", "5045088", "32943068", "28132940", "84975709", "59438328", "43103405", "16437342", "90642290", "54688685", "32609054", "208580984", "91039746", "55318870", "91040847", "22977352", "4775671", "197411002", "38711362", "4707936", "49863999"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:33487800"}

In this paper, we mainly discuss the issue of propagating labels in kernel space. A Kernel-Induced Label Propagation (Kernel-LP) framework by mapping is proposed for high-dimensional data classification using the most informative patterns of data in kernel space. The essence of Kernel-LP is to perform joint label propagation and adaptive weight learning in a transformed kernel space. That is, our Kernel-LP changes the task of label propagation from the commonly-used Euclidean space in most existing work to kernel space. The motivation of our Kernel-LP to propagate labels and learn the adaptive weights jointly by the assumption of an inner product space of inputs, i.e., the original linearly inseparable inputs may be mapped to be separable in kernel space. Kernel-LP is based on existing positive and negative LP model, i.e., the effects of negative label information are integrated to improve the label prediction power. Also, Kernel-LP performs adaptive weight construction over the same kernel space, so it can avoid the tricky process of choosing the optimal neighborhood size suffered in traditional criteria. Two novel and efficient out-of-sample approaches for our Kernel-LP to involve new test data are also presented, i.e., (1) direct kernel mapping and (2) kernel mapping-induced label reconstruction, both of which purely depend on the kernel matrix between training set and testing set. Owing to the kernel trick, our algorithms will be applicable to handle the high-dimensional real data.

The main goal of the this study is to prepare flood susceptibility maps for Ningdu catchment in China using frequency ratio (FR) as bivariate model and Logistic Model Tree (LMT) and Random Forest (RF) as data mining techniques as well as their comparison. At first, flood inventory mapping was constructed using 156 flood historical locations which finally divided randomly into two parts by a ratio of 70:30 for training (111 locations) and testing (48 locations) or model building and validation, respectively. Information gain ratio (IGR) and multicollinearity diagnosis tests were then applied to select conditioning factors. The results of the IGR showed that the altitude is the most effective factor contributing to flood occurrences at the Ningdu catchment while curvature factor was removed from modeling due to null predictive capability. Three flood susceptibility maps were prepared using the three aforementioned models and validated using some criteria including receiver operating characteristic (ROC), area under the ROC curve (AUC), kappa, root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). The results showed that LMT model has the highest prediction power (AUC = 0.982), followed by RF (AUC = 0.978) and FR (AUC = 0.969).

In addition, we also find that a progressive training strategy can foster a better neural network for the video recognition task than blindly pooling the distinct sources of geometry cues together.

Method and Materials: We supposed that IMRTdosedelivery errors were mainly caused by limitations in the dosedelivery mechanisms in the case of dynamic MLCs, especially using sliding window method. Firstly, we developed a program to extract dynamic properties of MLCs from MLC plan files and dosedelivery expectation data. Secondly, actual dosedelivery distributions were measured by irradiating IMRT fields to EPID. The gamma criteria(\u03b3) distributions simultaneously were calculated with standards of 3% dose error and 3mm dislocation. Thirdly, a support vector machine (SVM) is trained with a database, which is composed of dynamic properties and binary gamma criteria distributions (\u03b3\u22651 or \u03b3<1). The optimal hyper\u2010plane is given by SVM to classify groups. Results: 11 IMRT field data of prostate cancer were used to find a hyper\u2010plane of SVM, and other 2 IMRT fields were used to verify the performance of a trained hyper\u2010plane. We found that the velocity of leaf collimator edge and prescribed dose value at each point mainly cause dosedelivery error through iterated SVM classification tests. The error prediction results show high specificity (0.945) and accuracy (0.837), and relatively low sensitivity (0.452). Conclusions: This work indicated the potential for optimized IMRT plan, allowing for mechanical limitation of dynamic MLCs. The dosedelivery error prediction of IMRT planning can be essential information to maximize accuracy of IMRT planning. It can be also minimize cost to perform quality assurance (QA) process for IMRT. Low sensitivity of our preliminary results may be caused by insufficient IMRT field number used to train SVM.

In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial learning framework to learn a deep matching network for CISDL. Our framework mainly consists of three building blocks. First, a deep matching network based on atrous convolution (DMAC) aims to generate two high-quality candidate masks, which indicate suspected regions of the two input images. In DMAC, atrous convolution is adopted to extract features with rich spatial information, a correlation layer based on a skip architecture is proposed to capture hierarchical features, and atrous spatial pyramid pooling is constructed to localize tampered regions at multiple scales. Second, a detection network is designed to rectify inconsistencies between the two corresponding candidate masks. Finally, a discriminative network drives the DMAC network to produce masks that are hard to distinguish from ground-truth ones. The detection network and the discriminative network collaboratively supervise the training of DMAC in an adversarial way. Besides, a sliding window-based matching strategy is investigated for high-resolution images matching. Extensive experiments, conducted on five groups of datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the superior performance of DMAC.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TIFS.2019.2902826", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2918670247", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["22534034", "52097748", "53773497", "18486098", "18800070", "18465450", "17647931", "15824024", "1349318", "4492202", "14355694", "16866504", "16852038", "6001919", "14124313", "1996665", "22655199", "3429309", "7265088", "5799720", "34532433", "5819869", "6514262", "17893552", "12552176", "6346138", "13429319", "47159753", "673591", "10094478", "56507745", "623137", "206766608", "206594196", "14554538", "6613124", "5299559", "5574079", "1318262", "1033682", "6200260", "206771128", "13943041", "12803511", "5002792", "2063813", "16991836", "11996618", "3456798", "3366315", "5555257", "16489696", "11758569", "46898260", "14113767", "8162488", "117685", "4877931", "206593880", "52955351"], "inbound_citations": ["204837212", "210873709", "211026536", "211686235", "210697127", "210873811", "210838881", "211211498"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:86653999"}

It requires time consuming manual examination of cell images by a cytogeneticist to distinguish chromosome classes from each other. Thus, a reliable autonomous human chromosome classification system not only saves time and money but also reduces errors due to the inadequate knowledge level of the expert. Human cell contains 23 pairs of chromosome, 22 autosomes and a pair of sex chromosomes. Hence, we face a multi-class classification task which represents a challenging case for any sort of classifier. In this work, to solve this classification problem, we propose a novel methodology consisting two stages: (i) data preparation and training, and (ii) testing. To determine the most informative content of the dataset several preliminary experiments are conducted and a Principal Component Analysis is done. Then, a single Support Vector Machine (SVM ij ) is trained to separate a pair of classes, (i,j) where a numerical optimization method Pattern Search (PS), is employed to find the optimal parameters for the SVM ij . Considering 22 pairs of autosomes, 22 \u00d7 22 experts are trained and optimized. The cluster of experts, we obtain is named as Competitive SVM Teams (CSVMTs) where each SVM ij competes with the others to label a new classification instance. The final output of the classifier is determined by majority voteing.

Considering the temporal relationship between clinical data from sepsis patients in the ICU, we built a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to extract the intrinsic relation between different indicators in clinical data and meanwhile model the temporal dependencies, which only uses the previous information not future information to predict the results. Neural networks have made great achievements in unstructured data, such as image processing and speech processing, while traditional machine learning methods are better at processing structured data than neural networks. Thus, we trained an XGBoost model on the pre-processed data for improving the prediction accuracy.

Most of the existing subchloroplast localization predictors are limited to predicting single-location proteins and ignore the multi-location chloroplast proteins. While recent studies have led to some multi-location chloroplast predictors, they usually perform poorly. This paper proposes an ensemble transductive learning method to tackle this multi-label classification problem. Specifically, given a protein in a dataset, its composition-based sequence information and profile-based evolutionary information are respectively extracted. These two kinds of features are respectively compared with those of other proteins in the dataset. The comparisons lead to two similarity vectors which are weighted-combined to constitute an ensemble feature vector. A transductive learning model based on the least squares and nearest neighbor algorithms is proposed to process the ensemble features. We refer to the resulting predictor as as EnTrans-Chlo.

We build a Wasserstein partial transfer network where the Wasserstein adversarial objective is jointly optimized to partially transfer the relevance knowledge from source to target domains.

It is bases on structural risk minimization (SRM) principle and finds a classifier with minimized Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension. In pattern recognition, SVMs have been developed for data classification, feature reduction, and function estimation (2,3). The SVM classifier is very sensitive to outliers and noisy samples since the penalty term of SVM treats every data point equally in the training process. Increasing the values of slack variables, help in reducing the effect of noisy support vectors.

For spam detection, parameters optimization and feature selection have been proposed to reduce processing overheads with guaranteeing high detection rates. However, the previous approaches have not taken into account variable importance and optimal number of features and there are no approaches using both of them together so far. In this paper, we propose an optimal spam detection model based on Random Forests (RF) which enables parameters optimization and feature selection.

Several FLD detection and characterization systems using machine learning (ML) based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been applied. These ML systems utilize large number of ultrasonic grayscale features, pooling strategy for selecting the best features and several combinations of training/testing. As result, they are computationally intensive, slow and do not guarantee high performance due to mismatch between grayscale features and classifier type. This study proposes a reliable and fast Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)-based tissue characterization system (a class of Symtosis) for risk stratification of ultrasound liver images. ELM is used to train single layer feed forward neural network (SLFFNN). The input-to-hidden layer weights are randomly generated reducing computational cost. The only weights to be trained are hidden-to-output layer which is done in a single pass (without any iteration) making ELM faster than conventional ML methods. Adapting four types of K-fold cross-validation (K = 2, 3, 5 and 10) protocols on three kinds of data sizes: S0-original, S4-four splits, S8-sixty four splits (a total of 12 cases) and 46 types of grayscale features, we stratify the FLD US images using ELM and benchmark against SVM. Using the US liver database of 63 patients (27 normal/36 abnormal), our results demonstrate superior performance of ELM compared to SVM, for all cross-validation protocols (K2, K3, K5 and K10) and all types of US data sets (S0, S4, and S8) in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and area under the curve (AUC). Using the K10 cross-validation protocol on S8 data set, ELM showed an accuracy of 96.75% compared to 89.01% for SVM, and correspondingly, the AUC: 0.97 and 0.91, respectively. Further experiments also showed the mean reliability of 99% for ELM classifier, along with the mean speed improvement of 40% using ELM against SVM.

The generative network is trained by a minimax optimisation with a second discriminative neural network, tasked to distinguish generated samples from training motion data. In this work, we propose that (1) jointly optimising a third conditioning neural network that pre-processes the input image, can effectively extract patient-specific features for conditioning; and (2) combining multiple generative models trained separately with heuristically pre-disjointed training data sets can adequately mitigate the problem of mode collapse. Trained with diagnostic T2-weighted MR images from 143 real patients and 73,216 3D dense displacement fields from finite element simulations of intraoperative prostate motion due to transrectal ultrasound probe pressure, the proposed models produced physically-plausible patient-specific motion of prostate glands.

For instance, previous studies have applied pattern classification algorithms to electroencephalography data to predict the category of presented visual stimuli, human observer decision choices and task difficulty. Here, we quantitatively compare the ability of pattern classifiers and three ERP metrics (peak amplitude, mean amplitude, and onset latency of the face-selective N170) to predict variations across individuals' behavioral performance in a difficult perceptual task identifying images of faces and cars embedded in noise. We investigate three different pattern classifiers (Classwise Principal Component Analysis, CPCA; Linear Discriminant Analysis, LDA; and Support Vector Machine, SVM), five training methods differing in the selection of training data sets and three analyses procedures for the ERP measures. We show that all three pattern classifier algorithms surpass traditional ERP measurements in their ability to predict individual differences in performance. Although the differences across pattern classifiers were not large, the CPCA method with training data sets restricted to EEG activity for trials in which observers expressed high confidence about their decisions performed the highest at predicting perceptual performance of observers. We also show that the neural activity predicting the performance across individuals was distributed through time starting at 120 ms, and unlike the face-selective ERP response, sustained for more than 400 ms after stimulus presentation, indicating that both early and late components contain information correlated with observers' behavioral performance. Together, our results further demonstrate the potential of pattern classifiers compared to more traditional ERP techniques as an analysis tool for modeling spatiotemporal dynamics of the human brain and relating neural activity to behavior.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "20302949", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.03.030", "venue": "NeuroImage", "journal": "NeuroImage", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2125727363", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["1101322", "12610800", "20830460", "6838751", "9452932", "22332217", "3359666", "11455850", "7416645", "122956", "86163", "15634294", "12254077", "2702042", "52862338", "16583252", "17361387", "4539610", "24393003", "12929342", "13125849", "7395583", "11661123", "6844697", "25217018", "13115909", "28637672", "4327158", "4414187"], "inbound_citations": ["39085285", "20609212", "210165933", "58587591", "52808", "571256", "15866046", "20633025", "209428172", "8572825", "33826194", "3151285", "14930969", "16665900", "15418671", "281432", "132971097", "13944522", "53165244", "204837696", "7501660", "16837044", "215417328", "67866411", "5929952", "20910894", "13618954", "11923586", "204821670", "215179559", "22248789", "13740895", "14770231", "33244430", "1210417", "11250462", "195981932", "19171563", "13974933"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9999425"}

Thus each object presented in the image can be identified from their spectral response. The classification of multi-temporal hyperspectral image is a challenge task due to the problem of spectral variation over the time. In fact, many factors can affect the spectral signature of object like weather and climatic effects, so two images taken on the same area but at different times and under different conditions can lead to different spectral signatures for the same objects. This observation has fostered the idea of adopting 3D representation of spectral signature to classify multi-temporal hyperspectral image. The main objective of this representation is to have for each object a compact model which illustrate their spectral variation over the time, it represent the variation of reflectance as a function of time and spectral waveband. In this paper, we propose a new approach for multi-temporal hyperspectral image classification based on 3D spectral signature to solve the problem of spectral variation. This approach consist, foremost, to represent each pixel of classified image by a 3D spectral signature after the application of the powerful 3D modeling method \"Non-uniform Rational Basis Spline\" (NURBS), after, to apply local shape descriptor \"spherical harmonic decomposition\" to extract spectral features from each 3D spectral signature and, finally, to classify the image by means of supervised classifier \"Support Vector Machines (SVMs)\" with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel.

Alternately, the infant gazes that are at and away from the parent's face may be manually coded from captured videos by a human expert. However, this approach is labor intensive. A preferred alternative would be to automatically estimate the gaze direction of participants from captured videos. The realization of a such a system will help psychological scientists to readily study and understand the early attention of infants. One of the problems in eye region image analysis is the large dimensionality of the visual data. We address this problem by employing the spectral regression technique to project high dimensionality eye region images into a low dimensional sub-space. Represented eye region images in the low dimensional sub-space are utilized to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict the gaze direction (i.e., either looking at parent's face or looking away from parent's face).

Our solution belongs to learning based methods, which have recently become popular to stylize images in artistic forms such as painting. However, existing methods do not produce satisfactory results for cartoonization, due to the fact that (1) cartoon styles have unique characteristics with high level simplification and abstraction, and (2) cartoon images tend to have clear edges, smooth color shading and relatively simple textures, which exhibit significant challenges for texture-descriptor-based loss functions used in existing methods. In this paper, we propose CartoonGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework for cartoon stylization. Our method takes unpaired photos and cartoon images for training, which is easy to use. Two novel losses suitable for cartoonization are proposed: (1) a semantic content loss, which is formulated as a sparse regularization in the high-level feature maps of the VGG network to cope with substantial style variation between photos and cartoons, and (2) an edge-promoting adversarial loss for preserving clear edges. We further introduce an initialization phase, to improve the convergence of the network to the target manifold. Our method is also much more efficient to train than existing methods. Experimental results show that our method is able to generate high-quality cartoon images from real-world photos (i.e., following specific artists' styles and with clear edges and smooth shading) and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CVPR.2018.00986", "venue": "2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "journal": "2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2798729263", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10578341", "13284142", "206814936", "14365368", "6104263", "206593710", "9138017", "5641467", "1033682", "206594692", "2201072", "5808102", "980236", "14984990", "195908774", "2883848", "211227", "6635779", "7685985", "16489696", "1563370", "40656135", "2827303", "2930547", "7495864", "15096008", "14124313", "206592484", "16940978", "13904303", "3248075", "9043354", "15140030", "206770979"], "inbound_citations": ["199551887", "204800987", "214609507", "208006419", "202577225", "211038633", "57013680", "208267673", "202687705", "146120570", "194358484", "195353827", "196199033", "62841419", "209376953", "202405854", "210930050", "204958090", "174798131", "201126909", "117890116", "59600596", "204836918", "198909150", "204837199", "195848204", "54462104", "204828932", "139104108", "209459656", "211096607", "163157169", "210839653", "57013724", "140262773", "209068214", "202699739", "139102463", "146008016", "53960882"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:51767014"}

Firstly, initial experimental data for decoupling of piezoelectric six axis force/torque sensor is obtained by making a calibration experiment. And then, experimental data are analyzed according to evaluate indicator. The linear decoupling algorithm based on the least square (LS) method is performed. Fusion decoupling algorithm based on Least Square Support Vector Machine Regression (LSSVR) is adopted to optimize multi-dimensional nonlinear characteristics of sensor output. The mapping relation between input and output of the sensor is identified. After LSSVM fusion algorithm decoupling, the maximum nonlinear error and cross coupling error are 0.89%, and 0.1%, respectively.

However, unlike flat attribute-value data used in many existing methods, video is essentially a structured media with multi-layer representation. For example, a video can be represented by a hierarchical structure including, from large to small, shot, key-frame, and region. Moreover, it fits the typical Multi-Instance (MI) setting in which the \"bag-instance\" correspondence is embedded among contiguous layers. We call such multi-layer structure and the \"bag-instance\" relation embedded in the structure as Multi-Layer Multi-Instance (MLMI) setting in this paper. We formulate video concept detection as an MLMI learning problem in which a rooted tree with MLMI nature embedded is devised to represent a video segment.

Image classification, in particular, is a very active field of research with numerous applications. In addition to their high number, inputs of image classification problems often show significant correlation. Also, in proportion to the number of inputs, the number of available training samples is usually low. Therefore techniques combining low susceptibility to overfitting with good classification performance have to be found. Since for many tasks data has to be processed in real time, computational efficiency is crucial as well. Boosting is a machine learning technique, which is used successfully in a number of application areas, in particular in the field of machine vision. Due to it's modular design and flexibility, Boosting can be adapted to new problems easily. In addition, techniques for optimizing classifiers produced by Boosting with respect to computational efficiency exist. Boosting builds linear ensembles of base classifiers in a stage-wise fashion. Sample-weights reflect whether training samples are hard-to-classify or not. Therefore Boosting is able to adapt to the given classification problem over the course of training. The present work deals with the design of techniques for adapting Boosting to problems involving high numbers of inputs and classes. In the first part, application of Boosting to multi-class problems is analyzed. After giving an overview of existing approaches, a new formulation for base-classifiers solving multi-class problems by splitting them into pair-wise binary subproblems is presented. Experimental evaluation shows the good performance and computational efficiency of the proposed technique compared to state-of-the-art techniques. In the second part of the work, techniques that use Boosting for feature generation are presented. These techniques use the distribution of sample weights, produced by Boosting, to learn features that are adapted to the problems solved in each Boosting stage. By using smoothing-spline base classifiers, gradient descent schemes can be incorporated to find features that minimize the cost function of the current base classifier. Experimental evaluation shows, that Boosting with linear projective features significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches like e.g. SVM and Random Forests. In order to be applicable to image classification problems, the presented feature generation scheme is extended to produce shift-invariant features. The utilized features are inspired by the features used in Convolutional Neural Networks and perform a combination of convolution and subsampling. Experimental evaluation for classification of handwritten digits and car side-views shows that the proposed system is competitive to the best published results.

The work we present in the paper stems from a strict collaboration with expressive movement experts (e.g., contemporary dance choreographers) for defining a vocabulary of basic movement qualities. We recorded 13 dancers performing movements expressing the qualities under investigation. The recordings were next segmented and the perceived level of each quality for each segment was ranked by 5 experts using a 5-points Likert scale. We obtained a dataset of 150 segments of movement expressing Fragility and/or Lightness. In the second part of the paper, we define a set of features on IMU and EMG data and we extract them on the recorded corpus. We finally applied a set of supervised machine learning techniques to classify the segments. The best results for the whole dataset were obtained with a Naive Bayes classifier for Lightness (F-score 0.77), and with a Support Vector Machine classifier for Fragility (F-score 0.77).

A typical example is information filtering, i.e. the adaptive classification of documents with respect to a particular user interest. The interest of the user may change over time. Machine learning approaches handling concept drift have been shown to outperform more static approaches ignoring it in experiments with different types of simulated concept drifts on real-word text data and in experiments on real-world data for the task of classifying phases in business cycles exhibiting real concept drift. While previous concept drift handling approaches only use a single base learning algorithm and employ this same base learner at each step in time, this paper proposes a metalearning approach allowing the use of alternative learners and automatically selecting the most promising base learner at each step in time. This work in progress investigates, if such a contextdependent selection of the base learner leads to a better adaptation to the drifting concept, i.e. to lower classification error rates, than approaches based on single base learner only. Furthermore it investigates, how much the proposed metalearning approach allows to speed up the selection process and how much of the gained reduction in the error rate may be lost by that speed-up. The approaches with and without base learner selection and meta-learning are to be compared in experiments using real-world data from the above mentioned domains with simulated and real-world concept drifts, respectively. 1", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "LWA", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2151305268", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15643568", "3542492", "152859463", "2761338", "911579", "2274179", "10053158", "17797070", "61115623", "8528878", "1475864", "59889107", "2408074", "11192469", "15558554"], "inbound_citations": ["25580801", "16499079", "13542447", "928857", "6216624", "14824192", "16342950", "14331840", "53109768", "9070640", "69917354", "14049614", "16732688", "3918777", "8265883", "18651265", "14624857", "11554890", "12722005"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12639403"}

It is not common to measure the ferritin serum level in many cases, especially in the primitive stages of disease diagnostics; and in clinical laboratories it is not always feasible to assess ferritin serum levels. Objectives: In this research, we developed a multi-stage ensemble data mining model which predicts the ferritin serum level in a more efficient way. Summary of Proposed Model: The proposed model works as a Decision Support System (DSS) which considers the Complete Blood Count (CBC) test results as inputs in order to make a prediction for ferritin serum levels. The developed model uses demographical information of the patients in addition to CBC test results consisting of three stages: 1. Select important features using correlation-based feature selections; 2. Train the decision tree as a base classifier by applying four different ensemble regressions approaches including: Bagging, Additive regression, Rotation forest and Random subspace; 3.Evaluate and compare mentioned approaches based on correlation coefficient and root mean squared error criteria. Summary of the Results: The results show that the bagging approach outperforms the others in terms of both criteria. By conducting this case study, the proposed model has proven to be an efficient DSS in IDA diagnosis. Dataset Description Dataset was obtained in TALEGHNI Hospital, Tehran, Iran.

A particular case of semi-supervised settings is transductive learning, in which the goal is solely to label the available unlabeled data, instead of generating a predictive model that should generalize well to unseen data. Nevertheless, there are cases in which a transductive learner may perform even worse than an inductive learner that is trained with only the labeled data. For alleviating this problem, an effort towards safe semi-supervised support vector machines (S4VM) was made, so that a transductive SVM would never degenerate the performance when compared to its inductive counterpart. Even though robust, S4VM still lacks the ability of naturally dealing with multi-class problems, having to rely on multi- class encoding schemes, such as one-vs-one and one-vs-all strategies. These schemes may not take advantage of the full potential of S4VM, specially in complex multi-class problems with overlapping classes. In this article, we address this problem by providing a binary-tree scheme for aggregating distinct S4VMs in a bottom-up fashion. The proposed approach is named HiBUST, which stands for Hierarchical Bottom-Up S4VM Tree. Experimental results show that HiBUST can provide increased predictive performance for many multi-class problems when compared to a one-vs-one S4VM.

In order to define functional neighborhood, the similarities between the time series recorded for voxels are measured and functional connectivity matrices are constructed. Then, the local mesh for each voxel is formed by including the functionally closest neighboring voxels in the mesh. The relationship between the voxels within a mesh is estimated by using a linear regression model. These relationship vectors, called Functional Connectivity aware Local Relational Features (FC-LRF) are then used to train a statistical learning machine. The proposed method was tested on a recognition memory experiment, including data pertaining to encoding and retrieval of words belonging to ten different semantic categories.

Our dataset consists of approximately 1000000 observations from the Ruslana database and covers the period from 2011 to 2012.Instead of standard definition of default we use the notion of critical financial state which means that we add companies liquidated as a result of legal bankruptcy to those liquidated voluntary.We study four industries in detail: construction, manufacturing, real estate activities, retail and wholesale trade. Comparing industries, we come up to several compelling conclusions. On the one hand, the difference between sectors is so significant that it cannot be overcome by including several dummy variables but by estimating separate models for each industry.On the other hand, sectors are similar in several ways. Firstly, importance ranking of regressors is stable among sectors that are analysed. This results in unique optimal set of variables chosen out of six possible alternatives. To add, inclusion of non-financial characteristics impro\u00adves predictive power greatly. While age of a company and federal region are the key non-finan\u00adcial variables, size of a company is less important, and legal form is the weakest predictor. Secondly, Random Forest outperformed other statistical approaches on all data sets.

This paper advances a methodology to map summer cropping irrigated areas experiencing extreme climate and different management practices in the Murray\u2013Darling Basin (Australia). A Random Forest classification model was implemented to austral hemisphere summer irrigated areas for the water-years 2004/05 to 2010/11. The methodology used training samples from Landsat TM/ETM + reflectance data and monthly time-series of remotely-sensed observations from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The covariates included in the classification model characterised the monthly dynamics and rates of change of: (i) the vegetation phenology via the recurrent and persistent absorbed fractions of photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR rec and fPAR per , respectively); (ii) water use via remotely-sensed estimates of actual evapotranspiration ( ET a ), precipitation ( P ) and the difference between ET a and P . Observed agreement \u2013 in terms of the kappa coefficient \u2013 for correctly classified pixels in the training sample was 96%. Independent comparisons of yearly irrigated area estimates showed linear relationships with Pearson's correlation coefficients ( r ) generally greater than 0.7 for: (i) reported areas; (ii) areas with available metered water withdrawals; and (iii) estimates of agricultural yields. Sequential covariate optimisation suggested that the most important predictors to identify of irrigation areas included the emergence\u2013senescence period (as determined by the fPAR rec and corresponding rates of change) and the ET a surplus over P during this period.

Recently, using as much structure information hidden in a given dataset as possible to help improve the generalization ability of a classifier has yielded a class of effective large margin classifiers, typically as Structured Large Margin Machine (SLMM). SLMM is generally derived by optimizing a corresponding objective function using SOCP, and thus in contrast to SVM developed from optimizing a QP problem, it, though more effective in classification performance, has the following shortcomings: 1) large time complexity; 2) lack of sparsity of solution, and 3) poor scalability to the size of the dataset. In this paper, still following the above line of the research, we develop a novel algorithm, termed as Structural Support Vector Machine (SSVM), by directly embedding the structural information into the SVM objective function rather than using as the constraints into SLMM, in this way, we achieve: 1) to overcome the above three shortcomings; 2) empirically better than or comparable generalization to SLMM, and 3) theoretically and empirically better generalization than SVM.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-540-87732-5_56", "venue": "ISNN", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1566973065", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14727192", "28637672", "2695159", "22608392", "35730151", "463216", "207163669"], "inbound_citations": ["40499071", "9847721", "16799426", "46086794", "25738556", "17920929", "35636806", "359481", "159033493", "14185692", "56051003", "8273622", "41011934", "16715188", "16463733", "12716808"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:19641543"}

This selection expands radially, where the operator give only a center point of the structures to be detected. This software searches in a radial direction for the supporting vectors that belong to the basal nucleus, and for those corresponding to the background, based on the histogram. 5) Once the Support Vector Machine is trained in the previous module, the generated model serves to classify the image. Finally, the structures are properly detected and segmented, and are then validated by a neuro-anatomist by comparing the segmentation made by our software with a manual segmentation. In conclusion, we propose a new processing pipeline that includes a classifier using Support Vector Machines (SVM) for segmentation that can be used for image guided surgery.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-00846-2_80", "venue": "XIII Mediterranean Conference on Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing 2013", "journal": "XIII Mediterranean Conference on Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing 2013", "mag_id": "222984743", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:60072689"}

Firstly, the network structure is introduced in detail, in which the critic (or \u2018discriminator\u2019) estimates the Wasserstein-1 distance between the generated-sample distributions and the real-sample distributions, and optimizes the generator to approximate the minimum Wasserstein-1 distance, which effectively improves the stability of the adversarial training.

One important application of mobile sensing is activity recognition based on smartphone inertial sensors, which is a fundamental building block for a variety of scenarios, such as indoor pedestrian tracking, mobile health care, and smart cities. Although many approaches have been proposed to address the human activity recognition problem, several challenges are still present: 1) people's motion modes are very different for different individuals; 2) there is only a very limited amount of training data; 3) human activities can be arbitrary and complex, thus handcrafted feature engineering often fails to work; and 4) the recognition accuracy tends to be limited due to confusing activities. To tackle those challenges, in this paper, we propose a human activity recognition framework based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with two convolutional layers using the smartphone-based accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. To solve the confusion between highly similar activities like going upstairs and walking, this paper presents a novel ensemble model of CNN to further improve the identification accuracy.

The mechanisms of context-dependent and sleep-dependent memory (re)consolidation are unknown but involve the hippocampus. We simulated memory (re)consolidation using a connectionist model of the hippocampus that explicitly accounted for its dorsoventral organization and for CA1 proximodistal processing. Replicating human and rodent (re)consolidation studies yielded the following results. (1) Semantic overlap between memory items and extraneous learning was necessary to explain experimental data and depended crucially on the recurrent networks of dorsal but not ventral CA3. (2) Stimulus-free, sleep-induced internal reactivations of memory patterns produced heterogeneous recruitment of memory items and protected memories from subsequent interference. These simulations further suggested that the decrease in memory resilience when subjects were not allowed to sleep following learning was primarily due to extraneous learning. (3) Partial exposure to the learning context during simulated sleep (i.e., targeted memory reactivation) uniformly increased memory item reactivation and enhanced subsequent recall. Altogether, these results show that the dorsoventral and proximodistal organization of the hippocampus may be important components of the neural mechanisms for context-based and sleep-based memory (re)consolidations.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5512097", "pubmed_id": "28757864", "doi": "10.1155/2017/8091780", "venue": "Computational intelligence and neuroscience", "journal": "Computational intelligence and neuroscience", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2733958944", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["4973749", "20408204", "24543086", "1376709", "171099", "38551140", "1835412", "794338", "5826566", "15486774", "9710077", "15718313", "205431067", "890257", "1851910", "8640414", "205210730", "10114241", "1424898", "17168891", "2530016", "19788434", "1275369", "16611675", "16043910", "145434079", "1031828", "2715942", "4405184", "11619082", "5990520", "13635303", "10420726", "13949523", "18031801", "16275331", "4863743", "22280730", "32384692", "145318706", "15491958", "33683413", "998098", "15338287", "10156396", "538375", "8000706", "2964385", "215037266", "15111787", "13140150", "2376781", "15514443", "5470674", "7995929", "11945876", "205511443", "5626671", "214856629", "13104423", "19986879", "14298865", "14232627", "46487092", "16129740", "5484426", "13353549", "96125", "39", "26465964", "7802027", "9717981", "23957660", "2091689", "683526", "6436382", "21483139", "17874306", "16759592", "12231459"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4787507"}

The proposed perspective about error representation is fundamentally different from current learning methods, where in classification approaches they interpret the error as a function of the differences between the true labels and the predicted ones or in clustering approaches, in which the clustering objective functions such as compactness are used. Inverse feature learning method operates based on a deep clustering approach to obtain a qualitative form of the representation of error as features. The performance of the proposed IFL method is evaluated by applying the learned features along with the original features, or just using the learned features in different classification and clustering techniques for several data sets. The experimental results show that the proposed method leads to promising results in classification and especially in clustering. In classification, the proposed features along with the primary features improve the results of most of the classification methods on several popular data sets. In clustering, the performance of different clustering methods is considerably improved on different data sets.

To generate an auxiliary condition, we propose a modified clustering algorithm, namely, the Gaussian kernel density peak clustering algorithm (GKDPCA), which avoids the generation of data-augmentation noise and eliminates imbalances between and within social bot class distributions. Furthermore, we improve the CGAN convergence judgment condition by introducing the Wasserstein distance with a gradient penalty, which addresses the model collapse and gradient disappearance in the traditional CGAN. Three common oversampling algorithms are compared in experiments. The effects of the imbalance degree and the expansion ratio of the original data on oversampling are studied, and the improved CGAN performs better than the others.

In nature, GEPSVM attempts fitting two-class points with two planes. For an unseen sample, according to decision rule of GEPSVM, it will be assigned to the closest planes. In fact, this rule, in most cases, may result in poor test correctness. In this paper, based on GEPSVM, a new classifier named Localized GEPSVM is presented. Instead of two fitting planes, an unknown sample will be classified to the closest localized planes, i.e., convex hull, which are generated from the projections of two-class training points, respectively. Compared to GEPSVM, LGEPSVM outperforms GEPSVM in test correctness. Derivatively, LGEPSVM also develops an algorithm for solving convex hull on the projective hyperplane.

To determine the features that contribute significantly for functional classification, Sequential Forward Floating Selection (SFFS), Orthogonal Forward Selection (OFS), and SVM Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) algorithms are used and it is observed that out of 32 properties considered initially, only 20 features are sufficient to classify the proteins into its functional classes with an accuracy ranging from 91% to 94%.

Different from commonly used 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), we proposed a 3D CNN method with a newly designed structure including three hidden layers in cascade with a linear layer and a terminal Softmax layer. The proposed 3D CNN was applied to the maps of factional anisotropy (FA) in the whole brain as well as specific brain regions.

The proposed 3D CNN yielded a better classification result (93.3%) than the SVM (78.2%) on the whole-brain FA images, indicating gender-related differences likely exist in the whole brain range.

This project aims to compare the performance of the proposed Incremental Support Vector Machine, Incremental K-Nearest Neighbour and Hoeffding Tree for person authentication modelling.

Feature extraction i.e. mean, coherence, cross-correlation, mutual information, wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) and hjorth parameter has been done on the recorded EEG dataset.

The proposed study determines the suitability of multispectral information and stereoscopic-derived heights of Pleiades tri-stereoscopic satellite imagery for the identification of building footprints and the assessment of building heights. The study area is the Nyarugenge sector in the center of the City of Kigali. A tri-stereoscopic Pleiades satellite scene was used to process a digital surface model. An object-based image analysis provided the basic geometries and respective variables, which served as input features for a Support Vector Machine based classification. The comparison of the building footprints with ground reference information indicates a high accuracy. The assessment of building heights led to mixed results. The heights of buildings were derived with medium to high accuracies for building blocks with a well-developed road network or open spaces, which allowed the assessment of the elevation of the terrain surface.

A comprehensive understanding of the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics, water quality, and health risk of high-As groundwater is indispensable for the sustainable utilization of groundwater sources and resident health. Seventy-nine groundwater samples were collected from different aquifers and seasons. The hazard quotient (HQ) and carcinogenic risk (CR) of As for adults and children were assessed. Moreover, the effects of groundwater sampling site and seasonal change on As concentration were investigated. Then, the random forest method was used to evaluate the importance of the indicators and the influence of these important indicators on groundwater classification. Thirty-three percent of the groundwater samples had HQ values > 1, and the CR values of all groundwater > 1.00 \u00d7 10\u22126 for children, representing a serious health risk. Twenty-one percent of the groundwater samples had health risk for adult. High-As groundwater is present at depths less than 60 m, and groundwater As concentrations are slightly affected by seasonal changes. The random forest shows that the most important indicators that affect groundwater quality are Na, TDS, TH, and F, and the least important is As.

Using Support Vector Machines (SVMs), the data are classified. Finally, according to the property of SVMs outputs, we propose to fuse the results using three different operators.

The training set consists of approximately 272K wordforms, out of which 150K wordforms have been manually annotated with the four major named entity (NE) tags, namely Person name, Location name, Organization name and Miscellaneous name. An appropriate tag conversion routine has been defined in order to convert the 122K wordforms of the IJCNLP-08 NER Shared Task on South and South East Asian Languages (NERSSEAL)1 data into the desired forms. The individual classifiers make use of the different contextual information of the words along with the variety of features that are helpful to predict the various NE classes. Lexical context patterns, generated from an unlabeled corpus of 3 million wordforms in a semi-automatic way, have been used as the features of the classifiers in order to improve their performance. In addition, we propose a number of techniques to post-process the output of each classifier in order to reduce the errors and to improve the performance further.

A key to Graph SLAM-based localization is the detection of reliable landmarks, which are typically identified using visual cues or via NFC tags or QR codes. Alternatively, human activity can be classified to detect organic landmarks such as visits to stairs and elevators while in movement. We provide a novel human activity classification framework that is invariant to the pose of the smartphone.

In this paper, we investigate how audiovisual emotion recognition systems can leverage prototypicality, the level of agreement or confusion among human evaluators. We propose the use of a weighted Support Vector Machine to explicitly model the relationship between the prototypicality of training instances and evaluated emotion from the IEMOCAP corpus. We choose weights of prototypical and non-prototypical instances based on the maximal accuracy of each speaker. We then provide per-speaker analysis to understand specific speech characteristics associated with the information gain of emotion given prototypicality information. Our experimental results show that neutrality, one of the most challenging emotion to recognize, has the highest performance gain from prototypicality information, compared to other emotion classes: Angry, Happy, and Sad. We also show that the proposed method improves the overall multi-class classification accuracy significantly over traditional methods that do not leverage prototypicality.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACII.2015.7344624", "venue": "2015 International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII)", "journal": "2015 International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2188643306", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10395914", "12923007", "198187108", "16597149", "16701600", "2224122", "6783869", "14199096", "9315987", "13626757", "401672", "352650", "11820063", "15397131", "17399325", "7030516", "2309950", "207178999", "12589862", "961425", "1101681", "683036"], "inbound_citations": ["3788918", "19210180", "17632009", "145848897", "3460445", "18364179", "145947250"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13162229"}

First, three-dimensional CFD simulations using k-omega Shear Stress Transport (SST) and dynamic one-equation subgrid-scale models are conducted in a wall-bounded channel containing a cylinder for RANS and LES, respectively, to identify the turbulent kinetic energy discrepancy. Second, several flow features such as viscosity ratio, wall-distance based Reynolds number, and vortex stretching are calculated from the mean flow properties of RANS. Then these flow features are regressed onto the discrepancy using a Random Forests regression algorithm. Finally, the discrepancy of the test flow is predicted using the trained algorithm.

Energy is the most important resource in the world. An efficient energy distribution is required as smart devices are increasing dramatically. The forecasting of electricity consumption is supposed to be a major constituent to enhance the performance of SG. Various learning algorithms have been proposed to solve the forecasting problem. The sole purpose of this work is to predict the price and load efficiently. The first technique is Enhanced Logistic Regression (ELR) and the second technique is Enhanced Recurrent Extreme Learning Machine (ERELM). ELR is an enhanced form of Logistic Regression (LR), whereas, ERELM optimizes weights and biases using a Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO). Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Relief-F and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) are used for feature selection and extraction. On the basis of selected features, classification is performed using ELR. Cross validation is done for ERELM using Monte Carlo and K -Fold methods. The simulations are performed on two different datasets. The first dataset, i.e., UMass Electric Dataset is multi-variate while the second dataset, i.e., UCI Dataset is uni-variate. The first proposed model performed better with UMass Electric Dataset than UCI Dataset and the accuracy of second model is better with UCI than UMass. The prediction accuracy is analyzed on the basis of four different performance metrics: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The proposed techniques are then compared with four benchmark schemes. The comparison is done to verify the adaptivity of the proposed techniques. The simulation results show that the proposed techniques outperformed benchmark schemes. The proposed techniques efficiently increased the prediction accuracy of load and price. However, the computational time is increased in both scenarios. ELR achieved almost 5% better results than Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and almost 3% than LR. While, ERELM achieved almost 6% better results than ELM and almost 5% than RELM. However, the computational time is almost 20% increased with ELR and 50% with ERELM. Scalability is also addressed for the proposed techniques using half-yearly and yearly datasets. Simulation results show that ELR gives 5% better results while, ERELM gives 6% better results when used for yearly dataset.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/en12050866", "venue": null, "journal": "Energies", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2919779311", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["20605001", "113625127", "114795861", "111176331", "117381676", "111112275", "115152074", "115357272", "44116467", "21847549", "113939114", "52119305", "116858", "15037168", "115124299", "5516512", "7111252", "115803897", "39560607", "52888708", "64840007", "28262013", "21179873", "112407450", "14197727", "15768943", "17654166", "15264289"], "inbound_citations": ["211208572", "211553724", "198489381", "202100865"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:84839986"}

When estimating a functional relationship on the basis of empirical data we face three basic problems. Firstly, we have to deal with noisy and finite-sized data sets which is usually done be regularization techniques, for example Bayesian learning. Secondly, for many applications we need to encode the problem by features and have to decide which and how many of them to use. Bearing in mind the empty space phenomenon, it is often an advantage to select few features and estimate a non-linear function in a low-dimensional space. Thirdly, if we have trained several networks, we are left with the problem of model selection. These problems can be tackled by integrating several stochastic methods into an evolutionary search algorithm. The search can be designed such that it explores the parameter space to find regions corresponding to networks with a high posterior probability of being a model for the process, that generated the data. The benefits of the approach are demonstrated in detail on a regression and a classification problem.

Diversity values were predicted by means of Random Forest regression, on the basis of 10 factors: depth, distance from the coast, distance from the shelf break, latitude, sea-floor slope, sediment grain size, sediment sorting, distance from harbours and marinas, distance from rivers, and sampling gear. Predictions by Random Forests were accurate, the main predictors being latitude, sediment grain size, depth and distance from the coast. Based on predicted values, diversity hotspots were identified as those localities where indices were in the 15% top segment of ranked values. Only a minority of the diversity hotspots was included within the boundaries of the protection institutes established in the region.

In the multi-kernel structure, the kernel selection problem can be solved by adjusting the kernel weight, which determines the single kernel contribution of the final kernel mapping. The weights and parameters of the multi-kernel function were optimized using the PSO algorithm. In addition, the convergence speed of the PSO algorithm was increased using cloud theory. To ensure the stability of the prediction model, the result of a five-fold cross-validation method was used as the fitness of the PSO algorithm. To verify the results, receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) and landslide dot density (LDD) were used. The results show that the model that used a heterogeneous kernel (a combination of two different kernel functions) had a larger area under the ROC curve (0.7616) and a lower prediction error ratio (0.28%) than did the other types of kernel models employed in this study. In addition, both the sum of two high susceptibility zone LDDs (6.71/100 km2) and the sum of two low susceptibility zone LDDs (0.82/100 km2) demonstrated that the landslide susceptibility map based on the heterogeneous kernel model was closest to the historical landslide distribution.

Firstly, life-cycle vibration signals are acquired and divided into several signal segments, and EEMD is then utilized to decompose each segment into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). Afterwards, PCA is introduced to illustrate the trends of each IMF across the life cycle, and some of the IMFs that contribute to reveal the performance degradation process of the slewing bearing are selected to reconstruct and de-noise the vibration signals. After that, continuous squared prediction error (C-SPE) and its features are presented as performance degradation indicators. Finally, an RUL prediction model is built on the basis of the indicators using LS-SVM. The results of a life-cycle experiment show that the C-SPE of the de-noised vibration signals can precisely explain the performance degradation process of the tested slewing bearing and that the established RUL prediction model is close to practice. Besides, a comparison study shows that the C-SPE based RUL prediction model is more efficient and accurate than the signal based model.

More specifically, STW-KNN considers the spatial-temporal correlation and weight of traffic flow with trend adjustment features, to optimize the search mechanisms containing state vector, proximity measure, prediction function, and K selection. Furthermore, STW-KNN is implemented on a widely adopted Hadoop distributed computing platform with the MapReduce parallel processing paradigm, for parallel prediction of traffic flow in real time. Finally, with extensive experiments on real-world big taxi trajectory data, STW-KNN is compared with the state-of-the-art prediction models including conventional K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and C4.5.

Herein, an assessment of the Sentinel-1 & 2 to map burnt areas has been conducted. Initially the use of Sentinel-2 solely was explored, and then in combination with Sentinel-1 and derived radiometric indices. As a case study, the large wildfire occurred in Pedrogao Grande, Portugal in 2017 was used. Burnt area estimates from the European Forest Fires Information System (EFFIS) were used as reference. Burnt area was delineated using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classifiers, and two multi-index methods. Following this, burn severity was assessed using SVMs and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), again for both standalone Sentinel-2 data and in combination with Sentinel-1 and spectral indices. Soil erosion predictions were evaluated using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model. The effect of the land cover derived from CORINE operational product was also evaluated across the burnt area and severity maps. SVMs produced the most accurate burnt area map, resulting a 94.8% overall accuracy and a Kappa coefficient of 0.90. SVMs also achieved the highest accuracy in burn severity levels estimation, with an overall accuracy of 77.9% and a kappa of 0.710. From an algorithmic perspective, implementation of the techniques applied herein, is based on EO imagery analysis provided nowadays globally at no cost. It is also robust and adaptable, being potentially integrated with other high EO data available.

Twitter enables people from all over the world to interact in an extremely personal way. The immense quantity of user-generated text messages become available on Twitter that could potentially serve as an important source of information for researchers and practitioners. The information available on Twitter may be utilized for many purposes, such as event detection, public health and crisis management. In order to effectively coordinate such activities, the identification of Twitter users' geo-locations is extremely important. Though online social networks can provide some sort of geo-location information based on GPS coordinates, Twitter suffers from geo-location sparseness problem. The identification of Twitter users' geo-location based on the content of send out messages, becomes extremely important. In this regard, this paper presents a machine learning based approach to the problem. In this study, our corpora is represented as a word vector. To obtain a classification scheme with high predictive performance, the performance of five classification algorithms, three ensemble methods and two feature selection methods are evaluated.

For experimental analysis, we have collected real data from four multi-storied residential building. The collected data are provided as input for the acquisition layer. In the pre-processing layer, several data cleaning and preprocessing schemes were deployed to remove abnormalities from the data. In the prediction layer, we have used the deep extreme learning machine (DELM) for energy consumption prediction. Further, we have also used the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and artificial neural network (ANN) in the prediction layer.

Similarly, in the ANN, we have employed a different combination of hidden neurons with different types of activation functions to get the optimal structure of ANN. To obtain the optimal structure of ANFIS, we have employed a different number and type of membership functions.

The Butterworth correlation is applied to calculate the mass quality from the voidage value, and then six Venturi measurement correlations are introduced to predict the mass flowrate of two-phase flow. The flow pattern classifier is constructed by using the partial least square (PLS) method and the Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) classification method.

Automatic identification of medical texts about the aspects is essential since (1) disease aspect information is routinely created and updated by many different sources, and (2) both healthcare professionals and consumers need to retrieve the disease aspect information. Main challenges of identifying the disease aspect information include (1) many medical texts are written for a specific disease and hence often contain information about multiple aspects of the disease, and (2) disease aspects are predefined categories of interest, making it difficult to precisely express the interest with brief descriptions. In this paper, we model the aspect identification problem as a text classification problem, and develop a technique IDAI (Identification of Disease Aspect Information) that considers term contexts to enhance text classifiers to classify medical texts with information about multiple disease aspects (categories). Empirical results show that IDAI enhances a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, and when compared with an enhancement technique that considers term contexts, IDAI performs better.

It is critical that we are able to do this accurately and as early as possible in order that future disease modifying therapies for PSP may be deployed at a stage when they are likely to have maximal benefit. Analysis of gait and related tasks is one possible means of discrimination. Research Question Here we investigate a wearable sensor array coupled with machine learning approaches as a means of disease classification. Methods 21 participants with PSP, 20 with PD, and 39 healthy control (HC) subjects performed a two minute walk, static sway test, and timed up-and-go task, while wearing an array of six inertial measurement units. The data were analysed to determine what features discriminated PSP from PD and PSP from HC. Two machine learning algorithms were applied, Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF). Results 17 features were identified in the combined dataset that contained independent information. The RF classifier outperformed the LR classifier, and allowed discrimination of PSP from PD with 86 % sensitivity and 90 % specificity, and PSP from HC with 90 % sensitivity and 97 % specificity. Using data from the single lumbar sensor only resulted in only a modest reduction in classification accuracy, which could be restored using 3 sensors (lumbar, right arm and foot). However for maximum specificity the full six sensor array was needed. Significance A wearable sensor array coupled with machine learning methods can accurately discriminate PSP from PD. Choice of array complexity depends on context; for diagnostic purposes a high specificity is needed suggesting the more complete array is advantageous, while for subsequent disease tracking a simpler system may suffice.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "32078894", "doi": "10.1016/j.gaitpost.2020.02.007", "venue": "Gait & posture", "journal": "Gait & posture", "mag_id": "3006085972", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211232366"}

The use of prognostic health management (PHM) approach where maintenance action is taken based on current and future health state of a component or system is rapidly gaining popularity in the maintenance industry. Multiclass support vector machines (MC-SVM) has been identified as a promising algorithm in PHM applications due to its high classification accuracy. However, it requires parameter tuning for each application, with the objective of minimizing the classification error. This is a single objective optimization problem which requires the use of optimization algorithms that are capable of exhaustively searching for the global optimum parameters. This work proposes the use of hybrid differential evolution (DE) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) in optimally tuning the MC-SVM parameters. DE identifies the search limit of the parameters while PSO finds the global optimum within the search limit.

To overcome this drawback, the support vector machine algorithm(SVM) has been used to replace the original machine algorithms; currently the support vector machine algorithm(SVM) has been widely used to establish mathematical models at home and abroad.

It is possible that predicted and even unanticipated gamma-ray source classes are present in these data waiting to be discovered. Taking advantage of the excellent spectral capabilities achieved by the Fermi LAT, we use machine learning classifiers (Random Forest and XGBoost) to pinpoint potentially novel source classes in the unassociated 3FGL sample outside the Galactic plane. Here we report a total of 34 high-confidence Galactic candidates at |b|>5 degrees. The currently favored standard astrophysical interpretations for these objects are pulsars or low-luminosity globular clusters hosting millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Yet, these objects could also be interpreted as dark matter annihilation taking place in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies or dark matter subhalos. Unfortunately, Fermi LAT spectra are not sufficient to break degeneracies between the different scenarios. Careful visual inspection of archival optical images reveals no obvious evidence for low-luminosity globular clusters or ultra-faint dwarf galaxies inside the 95% error ellipses. If these are pulsars, this would bring the total number of MSPs at |b|>5 degrees to 106. We find this number to be in excellent agreement with predictions from a new population synthesis of MSPs that predicts 100-126 high-latitude 3FGL MSPs depending on the choice of high-energy emission model. If, however, these are dark matter substructures, we can place upper limits on the number of Galactic subhalos surviving today and on dark matter annihilation cross sections.

PAR models predict energy parameters (e.g., algal carbon fixation) to aid in decision\u2010making at PAR sites.

The 2012-2015 reported crash data from Nebraska, United States was obtained and two-vehicle crashes were extracted as the analysis data. The dataset was split into training/estimation (2012-2014) and validation (2015) subsets. The four prediction methods were trained/estimated using the training/estimation dataset and the correct prediction rates for each crash severity level, overall correct prediction rate and a proposed crash costs-based accuracy measure were obtained for the validation dataset. The correct prediction rates and the proposed approach showed NNC had the best prediction performance in overall and in more severe crashes. RF and SVM had the next two sufficient performances and MNL was the weakest method. Data clustering did not affect the prediction results of SVM, but KC improved the prediction performance of MNL, NNC and RF, while LCC caused improvement in MNL and RF but weakened the performance of NNC.

Though, the earlier detection techniques generally extract statistic features around the spatiotemporal interest points or extract descriptor in the regions where movement takes place, leading to limited abilities to successfully detect violence activities in video surveillance systems. To solve this problem, a new approach for the automatic detection of violence in video surveillance systems is proposed in this paper. Our proposed algorithm first extracts salient regions in the frames using PFT and Temporal PFT; salient regions may have a possible candidate region of violence. Then these salient region images are fed to the pre-trained deep networks to extract features and these extracted features are fed to the AdaBoost Support Vector Machine classifier for detection of whether the image contains any violent candidate or not. Experimental analysis on the two challenging standard datasets validates that the method proposed in this paper is better than the previous methods.

Recent works have proposed hybrid VAE-GAN frameworks which integrate a GAN-based synthetic likelihood to the VAE objective to address both the mode collapse and sample quality issues, with limited success. This is because the VAE objective forces a trade-off between the data log-likelihood and divergence to the latent prior. The synthetic likelihood ratio term also shows instability during training. We propose a novel objective with a \"Best-of-Many-Samples\" reconstruction cost and a stable direct estimate of the synthetic likelihood.

One issue in performing this task is symbolic regression, which represents the process in our application, when measured data fits the best represented mathematical formula. In past this was only a human domain; nowadays, there are computer methods, which allow us to do it more or less effectively. A novel method in symbolic regression, compared to genetic programming and grammar evolution, is analytic programming. The aim of this work is to verify the efficiency of the parallel approach of this algorithm, using CUDA architecture. Next we will discuss parallel implementation of random decision forest (RDF) to classify huge amounts of various spectra. The mathematical formulas obtained via AP will be used to reduce attributes of explored spectra.

Suffice it to say that one of the earliest supercomputer projects, the S. Unger's system destined for pattern recognition was a rectangular array of interconnected simple processing modules. At the beginning of 60s, an original conception of a reconfigurable cellular structure called Homogeneous Computing Medium was suggested in Russia. It is worth to note that recently this promising idea found its continuation in the MIT project Raw based on newest technology. Great consideration was given to associative memories and fine-grained SIMD architectures. Thus, in the late 80s the massively parallel fine-grained systems DAP (S. Reddaway) and CM (D. Hillis) made at the market a grave competition to the supercomputers of conventional architecture. In 90s, powerful microprocessors of essentially traditional architecture occupied the dominating position due to the rapid progress in microelectronics and the corresponding dramatic decrease of component cost. Nevertheless, the well-known rule remains valid: taking into account specific features of a given class of problems and computational methods, one can get great improvement in performance and cost/performance factor when using application specific unconventional architectures. After the publishing of the CFP for this Special Issue of SCPE, we received 10 papers submitted by 19 authors from various countries. In the present Issue five papers are being published which obtained the highest rating from reviewers. These papers introduce some interesting trends in the development of unconventional parallel computing systems. The first paper Reaction-Diffusion and Excitable Processors: a Sense of Unconventional by Andrew Adamatzky is devoted to a very important and prospective subject of parallel data processing in chemical media. So-called architecture-less processors are discussed where a layer of an oscillating reaction is considered a massively parallel system each elementary processor of which is represented by a micro-volume reactor. Cellular automata are used as a computational model. The author demonstrates that excitable media can constitute universal massively parallel computing devices. In the second paper A Scalable Multiprocessor for Real-Time Signal Processing Applications Hans Eberle and Daniel Scherrer present a new platform for real-time processing of continuous data streams such as audio, video or graphical data. To overcome the limitations of existing DSPs the authors designed a flexible and scalable communication infrastructure Switcherland which guarantees data transfer with bounded latencies. The advantages of suggested multiprocessor provide for a wide range of applications in real-time signal processing. Bernard Girau in his paper Conciliating Connectionism and Parallel Digital Hardware presents an original paradigm of digital hardware implementation of neural computations, Field Programmable Neural Arrays (FPNAs). Both theoretical and practical aspects are discussed including the mapping of FPNAs into FPGAs. It is shown that the suggested FPNA framework results in efficient fine-grained reconfigurable parallel hardware. Bertil Schmidt and Manfred Schimmler describe in their paper KPROC\u2014an Instruction Systolic Architecture for Parallel Prefix Applications a highly parallel architecture with 1024 floating-point processors on a single chip (at 0.25 micron CMOS technology). These processors constitute an instruction systolic array implementing parallel prefix computation. It is shown that many important applications can take advantage of the suggested model. Examples are discussed from different areas such as image processing, long argument arithmetic, etc. Finally, researchers from Computer Technology Institute (Patras, Greece) C. Konstantinopulos, A. Svolos, D. Serpanos, and D. Maritsas in the paper The Effect of Interword Connectivity in Associative Processing bring forward an important development of associative processors. They introduce an asssociative memory with a single-stage hypercube network interconnecting the memory words. Significant performance improvement of this architecture is demonstrated through the analysis of various real applications. We wish to express our deep gratitude to the reviewers (D. Sima, F.

This approach grew out of a computational model of the human cognitive map that exploited the distinction between procedural, topological, and metrical knowledge of large-scale space. More recently, Kuipers and Byun extended this semantic hierarchy approach to continuous sensorimotor interaction with a continuous environment, demonstrating the fundamental role of identification of distinctive places in robot spatial learning. Our current research extends the semantic hierarchy framework in three directions: * We are testing the hypothesis that the semantic hierarchy approach will scale up naturally from simulated to physical robots. We expect that it will significantly simplify the robot''s sensorimotor interaction with the world. * We are demonstrating how the semantic hierarchy, and the learned topological and metrical cognitive map, supports learning of motion control lows, leading incrementally from low-speed, friction-dominated motion to high-speed, momentum dominated motion. * We are developing methods whereby a tabula rasa robot can explore and learn the properties of an initially uninterpreted sensorimotor system, to the point where it can define ad execute control laws, identify distinctive places and paths, and hence reach the first level of the spatial semantic hierarchy. If these goals can be achieved, we will have formulated a comprehensive computational model of the representation, learning and use of a substantial body of knowledge about space and action. In addition to the intrinsic value of this knowledge, the semantic hierarchy approach should be useful in modeling other domains.", "year": 1993, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4615-3184-5_6", "venue": "Robot Learning", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "132968910", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["115137279", "16263890", "37545094", "9938636", "6859759", "36860067", "198996819", "62243010", "107062224", "37977278", "109727407", "16311000", "8741018", "58733214", "12186768", "14954247", "12489950", "10899923", "26848020", "2013334", "2278749", "120016766", "35450858", "41852334", "18256383", "54453812", "60110448", "110633143", "63647934", "28451892"], "inbound_citations": ["17485523", "582306", "11223325", "16760554", "10469245", "8360750", "10452493", "110579732", "16067904", "13451247", "8025510", "5892201", "18199701", "61565411", "11924894", "11659", "5810726", "113058076", "6547488", "11333802", "14892324", "16887881", "755150", "5991764", "62682963", "28455887", "1061764", "12404663", "9443632", "18806443", "18556521", "56010136", "459486", "56142911", "8556926", "15504424", "124741", "208871170", "18815968", "17746401", "674206", "6948305"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1273518"}

ORION2.0 [18] is a widely adopted NoC power and area estimation tool that is based on circuit-level templates, which use specific logic structures to model implementation of different router components. ORION2.0 estimation models can have large errors (up to 185%) versus actual implementation, often due to a mismatch between the actual router RTL and the templates assumed, as well as the effects of optimization tools in modern design flows. In this work, we propose comprehensive parametric and non-parametric modeling methodologies that fundamentally differ from logic template based approaches in that the estimation models are derived from actual physical implementation data. Specifically, we propose a new parametric modeling methodology as well as improvements to previous work on non-parametric modeling. Our work on parametric modeling proposes (1) ORION NEW models, developed using a new methodology that does not assume any logic templates for router components, (2) the use of parametric regression to fit the new models to post-layout power and area values, and (3) modeling extensions that enable more detailed flit-level power estimation when integrated with simulation tools such as GARNET. The ORION NEW methodology analyzes netlists of NoC routers that have been placed and routed by commercial tools, and then performs explicit modeling of control and data paths followed by regression analysis to create highly accurate NoC models. Our work on non-parametric modeling expands on our previous work [17] and demonstrates the use of four widely used non-parametric modeling techniques: Radial Basis Functions, Kriging, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, and Support Vector Machine Regression. The estimation models are also derived from actual physical implementation data. We observe that non-parametric modeling techniques have low overhead and complexity of modeling, and are highly accurate. When compared with actual implementations, our modeling methodologies achieve average estimation errors of no more than 9.8% across microarchitecture, implementation, and operational parameters as well as multiple router RTL generators.

The management of these multiple and simultaneous anthropogenic pressures requires reliable and precise data on their distribution, as well as information (data, modelling) on their potential effects on sensitive ecosystems. Focusing on Posidonia oceanica beds, a threatened habitat-forming seagrass species endemic to the Mediterranean, we developed a statistical approach to study the complex relationship between human multiple activities and ecosystem status. We used Random Forest modelling to explain the degradation status of P. oceanica (defined herein as the shift from seagrass bed to dead matte) as a function of depth and 10 anthropogenic pressures along the French Mediterranean coast (1700 km of coastline including Corsica). Using a 50 \u00d7 50 m grid cells dataset, we obtained a particularly accurate model explaining 71.3% of the variance, with a Pearson correlation of 0.84 between predicted and observed values. Human-made coastline, depth, coastal population, urbanization, and agriculture were the best global predictors of P. oceanica's degradation status. Aquaculture was the least important predictor, although its local individual influence was among the highest. Non-linear relationship between predictors and seagrass beds status was detected with tipping points (i.e. thresholds) for all variables except agriculture and industrial effluents. Using these tipping points, we built a map representing the coastal seagrass beds classified into four categories according to an increasing pressure gradient and its risk of phase shift. Our approach provides important information that can be used to help managers preserve this essential and endangered ecosystem.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.biocon.2018.04.006", "venue": null, "journal": "Biological Conservation", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2796671381", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["127994143", "154786039", "133767336", "84900917", "89141", "128878152", "13702712", "84003723", "3626971", "43220826", "37119038", "18828131", "4453338", "53538150", "26206024", "55709253", "127981377", "38887927", "39054415", "43204708", "204769274", "35078977", "84747576", "18304604", "60488129", "2140007", "3093707", "84587281", "6259425", "55253581", "85310982", "52253409", "4936412", "90778684", "91088748", "56261012", "27274903", "6839643", "8620591", "85918742", "14327012", "85368954", "8001853", "15990725", "39373058", "53375432", "54046502", "133726969", "214932768", "8610995", "23303149", "83609818"], "inbound_citations": ["212668556"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:91122979"}

Although many deep learning-based algorithms make great progress for improving the accuracy of nodule detection, the high false positive rate is still a challenging problem which limits the automatic diagnosis in routine clinical practice. Moreover, the CT scans collected from multiple manufacturers may affect the robustness of Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) due to the differences in intensity scales and machine noises. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised learning assisted pulmonary nodule detection framework based on a 3D Feature Pyramid Network (3DFPN) to improve the sensitivity of nodule detection by employing multi-scale features to increase the resolution of nodules, as well as a parallel top-down path to transit the high-level semantic features to complement low-level general features. Furthermore, a High Sensitivity and Specificity (HS2) network is introduced to eliminate the false positive nodule candidates by tracking the appearance changes in continuous CT slices of each nodule candidate on Location History Images (LHI). In addition, in order to improve the performance consistency of the proposed framework across data captured by different CT scanners without using additional annotations, an effective self-supervised learning schema is applied to learn spatiotemporal features of CT scans from large-scale unlabeled data. The performance and robustness of our method are evaluated on several publicly available datasets with significant performance improvements.

The regression coefficient (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) values are used to determine the accuracies between the use of a four-parameter (BU, CT, IE, AX) and a three-parameter (BU, CT, IE) SVR model in the predicting the local Pu amount in the spent nuclear fuel. The R2 value for the four-parameter case (0.9996) is closer to unity (best case) than that for the three-parameter case (0.9776). The RMSE for the four-parameter case (0.0034) is less than of the three-parameter case (0.0243). The results of the SVR based machine learning analyses to predict the axial variation of Pu mass density in nuclear fuel show that accurate results are obtained from using the four-parameter case when compared to the original predictions using the SERPENT code. The correlation coefficients for BU, CT, IE, and AX for the Pu mass density variation are also evaluated.

For example, subjects typically require 100-150 milliseconds more time for deciding upon the source of pattern discrepancies over the time required for deciding whether the same two patterns are either structurally identical or dissimilar. This kind of result suggests that music decision-making and musical thinking are the result of a sequence of time-and-effort decisions. Further, it is convenient and theoretically productive to display these reaction times as a hierarchy of task-processing difficulty. Doing so suggests that cognitive processing consists of a chain of feed-forward mechanisms in which the outcomes of immediate decisions are made available for subsequent decisions (see, for example, Fiske 1990, 1993). However, finding that listeners require an increasing amount of reaction time to solve various specifiable tasks does not in itself mean that cognitive structures are either functionally or mechanically designed as a hierarchy. The \"hierarchy\" found for the tasks may only be a theoretical construct or, worse, an illusion that neither correctly nor adequately portrays actual cognitive structure nor serves any useful theoretical purpose. One way of testing the validity of a cognitive descriptor is to construct an operational model. One such model is called a connectionist (or neural network) model. Connectionist models attempt to depict cognitive activity as closely as possible to real brain activity by taking advantage of both the behavioral results of experiments and the known characteristics of brain neural circuitry. This can be done in a number of ways but is generally accomplished by following a few design principles: 1. Designating an initial set of input units and their associated threshold values (this corresponds to identifying a set of specialized neurons and identifying their electro-chemical transmission potential); 2. Designating a set of \"hidden\" processing units and their associated connective \"weights\" (this corresponds to identifying a second set of neurons connected to the first and their synaptic connection threshold -or firingpotentials; weights are also viewed as an analogy for memory, that is, the excitatory potentials of neural networks appear to be equivalent to prototype representations of previous experiences); 3.

Accurate failure predictions can help in mitigating the impact of failures. Resources, applications, and services can be scheduled to limit the impact of failures. However, providing accurate predictions sufficiently ahead is challenging. Log files contain messages that represent a change of system state. A sequence or a pattern of messages may be used to predict failures. Contribution: We describe an approach to predict failures based on log files using Random Indexing (RI) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Method: RI is applied to represent sequences: each operation is characterized in terms of its context. SVMs associate sequences to a class of failures or non-failures. Weighted SVMs are applied to deal with imbalanced datasets and to improve the true positive rate. We apply our approach to log files collected during approximately three months of work in a large European manufacturing company. Results: According to our results, weighted SVMs sacrifice some specificity to improve sensitivity. Specificity remains higher than 0.80 in four out of six analyzed applications.

Recently, research in scenario planning benefits from utilizing generative adversarial networks (GANs) as generative models for operational scenario planning. In these scenarios, operators examine temporal as well as spatial influences of different energy sources on the grid. The analysis of how renewable energy resources affect the grid enables the operators to evaluate the stability and to identify potential weak points such as a limiting transformer. However, due to their novelty, there are limited studies on how well GANs model the underlying power distribution. This analysis is essential because, e.g., especially extreme situations with low or high power generation are required to evaluate grid stability. We conduct a comparative study of the Wasserstein distance, binary-cross-entropy loss, and a Gaussian copula as the baseline applied on two wind and two solar datasets with limited data compared to previous studies. Both GANs achieve good results considering the limited amount of data, but the Wasserstein GAN is superior in modeling temporal and spatial relations, and the power distribution. Besides evaluating the generated power distribution over all farms, it is essential to assess terrain specific distributions for wind scenarios. These terrain specific power distributions affect the grid by their differences in their generating power magnitude. Therefore, in a second study, we show that even when simultaneously learning distributions from wind parks with terrain specific patterns, GANs are capable of modeling these individualities also when faced with limited data. These results motivate a further usage of GANs as generative models in scenario planning as well as other areas of renewable energy.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1906.00662", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-30508-6_44", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2947498201,2973113771", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["52004041", "15432326", "49333876", "1820276", "3676765", "210995008", "12694249", "113868095", "173188578", "21209773", "54540017", "73610678", "55108351", "24123883", "52049473", "1033682", "11758569", "10659969"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:173991128"}

In our method each agent has knowledge of a time-varying local cost function, and the objective is to minimize asymptotically a global cost function defined by the sum of the local functions. At each iteration of our algorithm, agents improve their estimates of a minimizer of the global function by applying a particular version of the adaptive projected subgradient method to their local functions.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) based stability analysis method is a significant method started in the last century. However, the SVM method has several drawbacks, e.g. low accuracy around the hyperplane and heavy computational burden when dealing with large amount of data. To tackle the above problems of the SVM model, the algorithm proposed in this paper is optimized from three aspects. Firstly, the gray area of the SVM model is judged by the probability output and the corresponding samples are processed. Therefore the clustering of the samples in the gray area is improved.

A high invasion potential of this species has been reported through its opportunistic life-history traits and high phenotypic plasticity. Nevertheless, it appears that unlike many other invasive fish species, N. melanostomus has not been able to colonize small and mid-size tributaries of large rivers (streams of order higher than two or three). Given that the invasion history of N. melanostomus in Europe is still rather short, and its invasion potential so high, its future possible expansion represents a big question with important ecological, conservation and management implications. One of the ways to answer this question is to identify the key environmental parameters important for further expansion of N. melanostomus, and to compare these with other successful invaders with longer histories, e.g. topmouth gudgeon (Pseudorasbora parva) and pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus). In this study, basic environmental, physicochemical and chemical parameters, biological elements and human disturbances in all types of streams in Slovakia were analysed in order to identify the key factors that discriminate habitats where the three invasive species were present relative to those where they were not. Random Forest Analysis was used to predict and assess the relationship among the large number of potential predictor variables and a dependent variable. This method is useful especially when large numbers of correlated predictors are evaluated and both quantitative and qualitative predictors are involved. The main aim of this study was to estimate potential for further spread of the three invasive species, with an emphasis on the possibility of further expansion of N. melanostomus into small and mid-size tributaries of large rivers. The habitat parameters that characterize current distribution limits of N. melanostomus were found to be the wetted width, slope, pH, temperature and conductivity. The species was found to prefer wider wetted width and shallower slope, higher oxygen saturation and slightly alkaline pH. Nevertheless, the altitude (often considered a surrogate of several habitat parameters) limits current distribution of N. melanostomus both in Slovakia and other regions of Europe. Thus, in contrast to other successful invaders (L. gibbosus and P. parva) the analysis of key factors regulating current distributions of N. melanostomus suggests that its future spread into small and mid-size tributaries of large rivers is unlikely.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3391/ai.2018.13.4.09", "venue": null, "journal": "Aquatic Invasions", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2903198759", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["86336936", "2835067", "3918702", "45174121", "36528307", "15830818", "8137283", "89141", "38237552", "126475527", "88953592", "134802497", "14568741", "15921269", "133769452", "55739036", "84173141", "14150839", "83542970", "1445506", "86090713", "85956825", "83669457", "13881302", "6614588", "84977395", "53689573", "84146563", "3093707", "85007062", "9400466", "86034310", "86302923", "13336469", "84768912", "25123087", "205113073", "16202330", "84041714", "85995450", "83667089", "83539595", "15384365"], "inbound_citations": ["212939917", "91575072", "155980866"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:91435466"}

The selected features were diagnosis age, tumor size, lymph node involvement ratio, number of involved axillary lymph nodes, progesterone receptor expression, having hormone therapy and type of surgery. The minimum sensitivity, specificity, precision and accuracy of HPBCR were 77%, 93%, 95% and 85%, respectively in the entire cross-validation folds and the hold-out test fold.

This research aims to design and implement a hybrid sensory HAR system to provide more comprehensive, practical and accurate surveillance for older people to assist them living independently. This reseach: 1) designs and develops a hybrid HAR system which provides a spatio- temporal surveillance system for older people by combining the wrist-worn sensors and the room-mounted ambient sensors (passive infrared); the wearable data are used to recognize the defined specific daily activities, and the ambient information is used to infer the occupant\u2019s room-level daily routine; 2): proposes a unique and effective data fusion method to hybridize the two-source sensory data, in which the captured room-level location information from the ambient sensors is also utilized to trigger the sub classification models pretrained by room-assigned wearable data; 3): implements augmented features which are extracted from the attitude angles of the wearable device and explores the contribution of the new features to HAR; 4:) proposes a feature selection (FS) method in the view of kernel canonical correlation analysis (KCCA) to maximize the relevance between the feature candidate and the target class labels and simultaneously minimizes the joint redundancy between the already selected features and the feature candidate, named mRMJR-KCCA; 5:) demonstrates all the proposed methods above with the ground-truth data collected from recruited participants in home settings. The proposed system has three function modes: 1) the pure wearable sensing mode (the whole classification model) which can identify all the defined specific daily activities together and function alone when the ambient sensing fails; 2) the pure ambient sensing mode which can deliver the occupant\u2019s room-level daily routine without wearable sensing; and 3) the data fusion mode (room-based sub classification mode) which provides a more comprehensive and accurate surveillance HAR when both the wearable sensing and ambient sensing function properly. The research also applies the mutual information (MI)-based FS methods for feature selection, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) for classification. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid sensory system improves the recognition accuracy to 98.96% after applying data fusion using Random Forest (RF) classification and mRMJR-KCCA feature selection. Furthermore, the improved results are achieved with a much smaller number of features compared with the scenario of recognizing all the\u2026", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2913258970", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:86676190"}

To predict a future path for an agent, both physical and social information must be leveraged. Previous work has not been successful to jointly model physical and social interactions. Our approach blends a social attention mechanism with physical attention that helps the model to learn where to look in a large scene and extract the most salient parts of the image relevant to the path. Whereas, the social attention component aggregates information across the different agent interactions and extracts the most important trajectory information from the surrounding neighbors. SoPhie also takes advantage of GAN to generates more realistic samples and to capture the uncertain nature of the future paths by modeling its distribution. All these mechanisms enable our approach to predict socially and physically plausible paths for the agents and to achieve state-of-the-art performance on several different trajectory forecasting benchmarks.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1806.01482", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CVPR.2019.00144", "venue": "2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)", "journal": "2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2962687116,2805102305", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9854676", "10010192", "1001575", "15410404", "1693999", "1033682", "4461350", "29333691", "164251258", "4895187", "3930912", "8979634", "8394584", "17374844", "56507745", "19088692", "61330117", "12803511", "9469305", "7065547", "16060712", "3150075", "2930547", "206771266", "4410754", "14124313", "13286551", "1055111", "13663350", "752790", "2781886"], "inbound_citations": ["209832529", "214641168", "211041418", "211041418", "53418284", "199543955", "174798117", "174798117", "214743452", "211205148", "202719589", "212725342", "202583256", "198931828", "52288569", "215548413", "3782359", "211060378", "208548145", "128346817", "208541985", "203952488", "212718016", "204578244", "214641468", "207870260", "71148538", "211003761", "198928392", "212747544", "198234654", "209370535", "208355894", "201108525", "56475981", "201668865", "211032236", "199583054", "213175455", "67855477", "214727620", "174820331", "52306520", "153312094", "208267649", "165163630", "195833700", "202583762", "199064269", "204743837", "57825687", "211208660", "211532349", "210706199", "29169904", "4410754", "60440525", "210064226", "210697085", "214667580", "214667580", "202775558", "201810581", "209414705", "212410090", "203610478", "208512962", "212648721", "67877001", "208248075", "212705342", "212628478", "204788589", "146121264", "214802549", "211734075", "208157972", "208309914", "198229506", "198985989", "160020360", "202677135", "211132657", "155093065", "211011081", "52812470", "208139165", "212725547", "212725237", "53749327", "209386397", "52058722", "209376599", "214608726", "85517950", "198229691"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:46938830"}

Results showed that the RapidEye sensor with an 86.96% and Kappa value of 0.76 performed better than the rest of the sensors while the Red, Yellow and Red-Edge bands were most useful for detecting early PLS infestation. The value of the RapidEye sensor in detecting early PLS infestation can be attributed to the optimally centred Red Red-Edge bands sensitive to changes in chlorophyll content, a consequent of PLS infestation on maize leaves.

In this paper, we take special interest in two bio-potential-based biometric modalities, electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG), considering that they are both unique to individuals, and more reliable than token (identity card) and knowledge-based (username/password) methods. After extracting effective features in multiple domains from ECG/EEG signals, several advanced machine learning algorithms are introduced to perform the user identification task, including Neural Network, K-nearest Neighbor, Bagging, Random Forest and AdaBoost. Experimental results on two public ECG and EEG datasets show that ECG is a more robust biometric modality compared to EEG, leveraging a higher signal to noise ratio and also more distinguishable morphological patterns.

In this work, we argue that beside developing good audio and video features, to build reliable depression detection systems, text-based content features are also of importance to analyse depression-related textual indicators. Furthermore, to improve the performance of automatic depression assessment systems, powerful models, capable of modelling the characteristics of depression embedded in the audio, visual and text descriptors, are also required. This paper proposes new text and video features and hybridizes deep and shallow models for depression estimation and classification from audio, video and text descriptors. The proposed hybrid framework consists of three main parts: 1) A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) based audio-visual multi-modal depression recognition model for estimating the Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-8); 2) A Paragraph Vector (PV) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) based model for inferring the physical and mental conditions of the individual from the transcripts of the interview; 3) A Random Forest (RF) model for depression classification from the estimated PHQ-8 score and the inferred conditions of the individual. In the PV-SVM model, PV embedding is used to obtain fixed-length feature vectors from transcripts of the answers to the questions associated with psychoanalytic aspects of depression, which are subsequently fed into the SVM classifiers for detecting the presence/absence of the considered psychoanalytic symptoms. To our best knowledge, this approach is the first attempt to apply PV for depression analysis. Besides, we propose a new visual descriptor - Histogram of Displacement Range (HDR) to characterize the displacement and velocity of the facial landmarks in the video segment. Experiments have been carried out on the Audio Visual Emotion Challenge (AVEC2016) depression dataset, they demonstrate that: 1) The proposed hybrid framework effectively improves the accuracies of both depression estimation and depression classification, with an average F1 measure up to 0.746, which is higher than the best result (0.724) of the depression sub-challenge of AVEC2016. 2) HDR obtains better depression recognition performance than Bag-of-Words (BoW) and Motion History Histogram (MHH) features.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TAFFC.2018.2870398", "venue": null, "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing", "mag_id": "2891155597", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["86576234", "204974963", "211057150", "201731134"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:149507890"}

The refinement process is divided into four layers, each having an implementation and a verification step. In the first layer, the ML model is implemented and tested in software with mature libraries support. On the second layer, a hardware component is auto-generated out of the software model and is tested within a hardware simulator. The third layer consists out of refining and testing the ML HW component in a real FPGA test-design also evaluating it according to various criteria (timing, power, accuracy and resource utilization).

Methods for predicting SWC that have simple data requirements are needed to achieve an optimal irrigation schedule, especially for various water-saving irrigation strategies that are required to resolve both food and water security issues under conditions of water shortages. Thus, a two-year field investigation was carried out to provide a dataset to compare the effectiveness of HYDRUS-2D, a physically-based numerical model, with various machine-learning models, including Multiple Linear Regressions (MLR), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), for simulating time series of SWC data under water stress conditions. SWC was monitored using TDRs during the maize growing seasons of 2010 and 2011. Eight combinations of six, simple, independent parameters, including pan evaporation and average air temperature as atmospheric parameters, cumulative growth degree days ( cGDD ) and crop coefficient ( K c ) as crop factors, and water deficit ( WD ) and irrigation depth ( In ) as crop stress factors, were adopted for the estimation of SWCs in the machine-learning models. Having Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) in the range of 0.54\u20132.07 mm, HYDRUS-2D ranked first for the SWC estimation, while the ANFIS and SVM models with input datasets of cGDD , K c , WD and In ranked next with RMSEs ranging from 1.27 to 1.9 mm and mean bias errors of \u22120.07 to 0.27 mm, respectively. However, the MLR models did not perform well for SWC forecasting, mainly due to non-linear changes of SWCs under the irrigation process. The results demonstrated that despite requiring only simple input data, the ANFIS and SVM models could be favorably used for SWC predictions under water stress conditions, especially when there is a lack of data. However, process-based numerical models are undoubtedly a better choice for predicting SWCs with lower uncertainties when required data are available, and thus for designing water saving strategies for agriculture and for other environmental applications requiring estimates of SWCs.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.11.007", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Hydrology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2554960095", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["128687360", "153823505", "27619801", "97610317", "128402690", "129706252", "41366277", "60893186", "122267263", "29079334", "133712136", "85272835", "207129036", "154334834", "86684370", "96044643", "128688900", "95566598", "154368615", "14345934", "14991042", "129708361", "15042349", "96437820", "153190581", "153909409", "109721425", "121975765", "129479547", "133208970", "109966548", "101235049", "95881313", "8470994", "153942984", "128953902", "54077111", "154471471", "154170318", "154702462", "54186283", "195703821", "55376762", "84540829", "53453639", "3918199", "26820219", "54668842", "128554426", "153812555", "86151049", "53625895", "130861949", "7138354", "86082628", "129109825", "154047444"], "inbound_citations": ["210978006", "4946029", "49346268", "134159708", "164801240", "52973935", "201667783", "127968016", "132977606", "134573920"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:133432653"}

Current state-of-the-art models, via a large number of parameters and pre-training on massive text corpus, have shown impressive results on several downstream tasks. Many researchers have studied previous (non-Transformer) models to understand their actual behavior under different scenarios, showing that these models are taking advantage of clues or failures of datasets and that slight perturbations on the input data can severely reduce their performance. In contrast, recent models have not been systematically tested with adversarial-examples in order to show their robustness under severe stress conditions. For that reason, this work evaluates three Transformer-based models (RoBERTa, XLNet, and BERT) in Natural Language Inference (NLI) and Question Answering (QA) tasks to know if they are more robust or if they have the same flaws as their predecessors. As a result, our experiments reveal that RoBERTa, XLNet and BERT are more robust than recurrent neural network models to stress tests for both NLI and QA tasks.

Conceptually, the case for using ILP to construct relational features rests on treating these features as functions, the automated discovery of which necessarily requires some form of first-order learning. Practically, there are now several reports in the literature that suggest that augmenting any existing features with ILP-discovered relational features can substantially improve the predictive power of a model. While the approach is straightforward enough, much still needs to be done to scale it up to explore more fully the space of possible features that can be constructed by an ILP system. This is in principle, infinite and in practice, extremely large. Applications have been confined to heuristic or random selections from this space. In this paper, we address this computational difficulty by allowing features to be constructed in a distributed manner. That is, there is a network of computational units, each of which employs an ILP engine to construct some small number of features and then builds a (local) model. We then employ a consensus-based algorithm, in which neighboring nodes share information to update local models. For a category of models (those with convex loss functions), it can be shown that the algorithm will result in all nodes converging to a consensus model. In practice, it may be slow to achieve this convergence. Nevertheless, our results on synthetic and real datasets that suggests that in relatively short time the\"best\"node in the network reaches a model whose predictive accuracy is comparable to that obtained using more computational effort in a non-distributed setting (the best node is identified as the one whose weights converge first).", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": "1409.3446", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2397875223", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15115468", "12242182", "6048105", "15258841", "3360925", "60492634", "115963355", "2120244", "51789432", "59633603", "16159169", "17314819", "1680222", "10770385", "1539404", "7728586", "47332111", "1617976", "8510933", "35592593", "1577926", "323588", "2608879", "15880739", "15011754", "29828273", "5689705", "16875156", "682510", "10978362", "1881928", "60567601", "123001559", "7747592", "10626214", "8012912", "16395458", "6108215", "8070691", "15996292", "2506473", "8768960", "15781700", "1785", "10621079", "117910602", "40420741", "704994", "34028114", "18229590", "771841", "39824034", "17975552", "123318011", "7885987"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17443281"}

Tracking-by-detection is a widely used practice in recent tracking systems. These usually rely on independent single frame detections that are handled as observations in a recursive estimation framework. If these observations are imprecise the generated trajectory is prone to be updated towards a wrong position. In contrary to existing methods our novel approach uses a Dynamic Bayes Network in which the state vector of a recursive Bayes filter, as well as the location of the tracked object in the image are modelled as unknowns. These unknowns are estimated in a probabilistic framework taking into account a dynamic model, and a state-of-the-art pedestrian detector and classifier. The classifier is based on the Random Forest-algorithm and is capable of being trained incrementally so that new training samples can be incorporated at runtime. This allows the classifier to adapt to the changing appearance of a target and to unlearn outdated features. The approach is evaluated on a publicly available benchmark.

In human patients, some neurodegenerative diseases lead to characteristic movement dysfunctions, such as abnormal gait and tremors. However, it is currently unknown whether similar movement defects occur in the respective fly models, which could be used to model and better understand the pathophysiology of movement disorders. To address this question, we developed a machine-learning image-analysis programme \u2014 Feature Learning-based LImb segmentation and Tracking (FLLIT) \u2014 that automatically tracks leg claw positions of freely moving flies recorded on high-speed video, generating a series of body and leg movement parameters. Of note, FLLIT requires no user input for learning. We used FLLIT to characterise fly models of Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD) and Spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3). Between these models, walking gait and tremor characteristics differed markedly, and recapitulated signatures of the respective human diseases. Selective expression of mutant SCA3 in dopaminergic neurons led to phenotypes resembling that of PD flies, suggesting that the behavioural phenotype may depend on the circuits affected, rather than the specific nature of the mutation.

This seems to be due to insufficient understanding of their properties and the lack of user-friendly software implementing them. Here we present a study where the accuracy of AutoDock Vina, arguably the most commonly-used docking software, is strongly improved by following a machine learning approach.

We discuss how the latter opens the door to new opportunities in scoring function development. In order to facilitate the translation of this advance to enhance structure-based molecular design, we provide software to directly re-score Vina-generated poses and thus strongly improve their predicted binding affinity.

Results show that cyberbullying detection improved when personalities and sentiments were used, however, a similar effect was not observed for emotion. A further analysis on the personalities revealed extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism and psychopathy to have greater impacts in detecting online bullying compared to other traits. Key features were identified using the dimension reduction technique, and integrated into a single model, which produced the best detection accuracy. The paper describes suggestions and recommendations as to how the findings can be applied to mitigate cyberbullying.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cose.2019.101710", "venue": "Comput.

FVS is widely used at the stand level for simulating fire effects on tree mortality, carbon, and biomass, but uses at the landscape level are limited by availability of forest inventory data for large contiguous areas. Detailed mapping of trees for large areas is not feasible with current technologies, but statistical methods for matching forest plot data with biophysical characteristics of the landscape offers a practical means to populate landscapes with a limited set of forest plot inventory data. We used a modified Random Forests approach with Landfire vegetation and biophysical predictors to impute plot data from the U.S. Forest Service\u2019s Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA). This method imputes the plot with the best statistical match, according to a \u201cforest\u201d of decision trees, to each pixel of gridded landscape data.

Non-apple pixels as background are firstly removed from input images. Then, stem end is detected by combination of morphological methods and Mahalanobis distant classifier. Calyx region is also detected by applying K-means clustering on the Cb component in YCbCr color space. After that, defects segmentation is achieved using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. In the next step, stem end and calyx regions are removed from defected regions to refine and improve apple grading process. Then, statistical, textural and geometric features from refined defected regions are extracted. Finally, for apple grading, a comparison between performance of Support Vector Machine (SVM), MLP and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifiers is done. Classification is done in two manners which in the first one, an input apple is classified into two categories of healthy and defected. In the second manner, the input apple is classified into three categories of first rank, second rank and rejected ones. In both grading steps, SVM classifier works as the best one with recognition rate of 92.5% and 89.2% for two categories (healthy and defected) and three quality categories (first rank, second rank and rejected ones), among 120 different golden delicious apple images, respectively, considering K-folding with K = 5.

The detection of masses from mammograms is considered to be a challenging problem due to their large variation in shape, size, boundary and texture and also because of their low signal to noise ratio compared to the surrounding breast tissue. In this paper, we present a novel approach for detecting masses in mammograms using a cascade of deep learning and random forest classifiers. The first stage classifier consists of a multi-scale deep belief network that selects suspicious regions to be further processed by a two-level cascade of deep convolutional neural networks. The regions that survive this deep learning analysis are then processed by a two-level cascade of random forest classifiers that use morphological and texture features extracted from regions selected along the cascade. Finally, regions that survive the cascade of random forest classifiers are combined using connected component analysis to produce state-of-the-art results. We also show that the proposed cascade of deep learning and random forest classifiers are effective in the reduction of false positive regions, while maintaining a high true positive detection rate.

Nevertheless, to automatically recognize those structures and extract their inner semantic meaning are still very challenging tasks. In this paper we introduce a new semantic representation that allows to describe histopathological concepts suitable for classification. The approach herein identify local concepts using a dictionary learning approach, i.e., the algorithm learns the most representative atoms from a set of random sampled patches, and then models the spatial relations among them by counting the co-occurrence between atoms, while penalizing the spatial distance.

For this purpose, 240 histological microscopical fields of view, 24 per tissue class, were collected. Those images fed a Support Vector Machine classifier per class, using 120 images as train set and the remaining ones for testing, maintaining the same proportion of each concept in the train and test sets.

Rules-based Similarity utilizes a notion of a reduct to construct new features which can be interpreted as important aspects of a similarity in the classification context. Having defined such features it is possible to utilize the idea of Tversky's feature contrast similarity model in order to design an accurate and psychologically plausible similarity relation for a given domain of objects. DRBS tries to incorporate a broader array of aspects of the similarity into the model by constructing many heterogeneous sets of features from multiple decision reducts. To ensure diversity, the reducts are computed on random subsets of objects and attributes.

The induced similarity relation and the resulting similarity function can be used to perform an accurate classification of previously unseen objects in a case-based fashion.

The problem of detecting a convoy merging traffic situation in real traffic scenarios serves as example to show the process of situation aspect modelling, feature selection and classification using the above mentioned methodology. It is demonstrated how the challenge of labelling changing SA can be solved using an undefined transition class and how this effects classification results.

Concretely, it first adopts an object-agnostic method to associate information from tactile and visual modalities. It then recognizes a novel object by using its tactile signal to retrieve perceptually similar surface material images through the learned cross-modal correlation. This problem exhibits a challenge because data from visual and tactile modalities are highly heterogeneous and weakly paired. Moreover, the framework should not only consider cross-modal pairwise relevance but also be discriminative and generalized for unseen objects. To this end, we propose a weakly paired cross-modal adversarial learning (WCMAL) model for the visual-tactile cross-modal retrieval, which combines the advantages of deep learning and adversarial learning.

However, SDMs built with count data, referred to as species abundance models (SAMs), are still less commonly used to date, but increasingly receiving attention. Species occurrence and abundance do not frequently display similar patterns, and often they are not even well correlated. Therefore, only using information based on SDMs or SAMs leads to an insufficient or misleading conservation efforts. How to combine information from SDMs and SAMs and how to apply the combined information to achieve unified conservation remains a challenge. In this study, we introduce and propose a priority protection index (PI). The PI combines the prediction results of the occurrence and abundance models. As a case study, we used the best-available presence and count records for an endangered farmland species, the Great Bustard (Otis tarda dybowskii), in Bohai Bay, China. We then applied the Random Forest algorithm (Salford Systems Ltd. Implementation) with eleven predictor variables to forecast the spatial occurrence as well as the abundance distribution. The results show that the occurrence model had a decent performance (ROC: 0.77) and the abundance model had a RMSE of 26.54. It is noteworthy that environmental variables influenced bustard occurrence and abundance differently. The area of farmland, and the distance to residential areas were the top important variables influencing bustard occurrence. While the distance to national roads and to expressways were the most important influencing abundance. In addition, the occurrence and abundance models displayed different spatial distribution patterns. The regions with a high index of occurrence were concentrated in the south-central part of the study area; and the abundance distribution showed high populations occurrence in the central and northwestern parts of the study area. However, combining occurrence and abundance indices to produce a priority protection index (PI) to be used for conservation could guide the protection of the areas with high occurrence and high abundance (e.g., in Strategic Conservation Planning). Due to the widespread use of SDMs and the easy subsequent employment of SAMs, these findings have a wide relevance and applicability than just those only based on SDMs or SAMs. We promote and strongly encourage researchers to further test, apply and update the priority protection index (PI) elsewhere to explore the generality of these findings and methods that are now readily available.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5732545", "pubmed_id": "29255652", "doi": "10.7717/peerj.4160", "venue": "PeerJ", "journal": "PeerJ", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2771872949", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["197560113"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6722473"}

In this paper, we focus on extracting relevance information from one source of user interactions, user click- through data which record the sequence of documents being clicked in the result sets during a user search session. We emphasize the importance of the temporal nature of user click patterns and use conditional random fields to model its relations with the degree of relevance of the individual documents in the result sets. A key advantage of our models and algorithms is their ability to express the long-distance inter-actions conditioned on the click patterns. We test our algorithms using click-through data from a commercial search engine and evaluate the extracted relevance grades against those assigned by human judges. I. INTRODUCTION Feature engineering is of vital importance to design ranking functions for information retrieval systems and search engines. Features are indicators of degree of relevance of a document with respect to a query. Early days of information retrieval research have seen heavy reliance on textual features. With the advance of the World Wide Web, a new generation of features exploring the hyperlink structures of Web document have been proposed (1). Recently, much research has focus on exploring user relevance feedback in various forms including social annotations and user click-throughs (2)(3). There has been a great deal of work on learning from click data. Methods of using click-through data have been proposed for different applications. Oztekin (4) propose several methods for meta-search.They have compared the methods by using a new metric called 'average position of clicks' calculated based on click-through data. The authors claim that the implicit evaluation method based on users' clicks can offer more statistically reliable results than an explicit evaluation method based on users' relevance judgments. Cui (5) try to use click-through data to solve the problem of mismatch between query terms and document terms. With click-through data, the probabilistic correlations between query terms and documents terms can be extracted and high quality term expansion can be conducted. Beeferman (6) propose methods for harvesting clusters of queries and web pages by using click-through data. In this paper, we focus on extracting relevance information from user click-throughs, we want to infer the degree of relevance of each documents in the search engine result sets based on the patterns of user click-throughs. We collected click-through data from a search engine. We aggregate all the user sessions with the same query; generally there will be variations in the patterns of user clicks. But over many sessions, certain probabilistic patterns will emerge. We propose to use Conditional Random Fields(CRF) (7) to model the temporal structure of user sessions and use the observed click patterns to predict the hidden state of each document. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in section II we introduce the Conditional Random Field and features used in CRF model. In section III we introduce the algorithms of modeling user click sequences. In section IV, we give the detailed the information about the experiment and compare the performance of model on different feature sets.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CISE.2009.5366423", "venue": "2009 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Software Engineering", "journal": "2009 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Software Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2162817540", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["911040", "14696381", "11747294", "277918", "12943282", "6679711", "13618539", "1981391"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15503942"}

Many of the error correction schemes are based on modeling of sensor characteristics and are highly complex and non-flexible. Moreover, these schemes are not ideal for online error corrections, which are essential for realtime systems. Artificial Neural networks (ANN) with proper learning strategies prove to be good candidates in such cases. The proposed Meta-cognitive Extreme Learning Machine (McELM) based ANN framework, employed for error correction, automatically captures the non-linear behaviour of sensors to external environmental disturbances like temperature, structural vibration etc. A clustering based thresholding scheme has been used to improve the adaptiveness and stability of the ANN network. The performance of the algorithm has been evaluated on experimental data obtained from pressure sensors used for absolute pressure measurement onboard Indian launch vehicles.

Various algorithms for hearing loss compensation and environmentalnoise reduction have been implemented in the hearing aid; however, the performance of these algorithms vary inaccordance with external sound situations and therefore, it is important to tune the operation of the hearing aid appro-priately in accordance with a wide variety of sound situations. In this study, a sound classification algorithmthat can be applied to the hearing aid was suggested. The proposed algorithm can classify the differenttypes of speech situations into four categories: 1) speech-only, 2) noise-only, 3) speech-in-noise, and 4)music-only. The proposed classification algorithm consists of two sub-parts: a feature extractor and aspeech situation classifier. The former extracts seven characteristic features - short time energy and zerocrossing rate in the time domain; spectral centroid, spectral flux and spectral roll-off in the frequencydomain; mel frequency cepstral coefficients and power values of mel bands - from the recent input signalsof two microphones, and the latter classifies the current speech situation. The experimental resultsshowed that the proposed algorithm could classify the kinds of speech situations with an accuracy of over94.4%. Based on these results, we believe that the proposed algorithm can be applied to the hearing aidto improve speech intelligibility in noisy environments.Key words: hearing aids, classification, artificial neural network, hearing impaired", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.9718/JBER.2013.34.1.8", "venue": "Journal of Biomedical Engineering Research", "journal": "Journal of Biomedical Engineering Research", "mag_id": "2057946247", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:111206313"}

These unrealistic models will cause problems in production forecasting and reserves estimation. In this work, a technique is proposed to guarantee sedimentological realism within the AHM process. Building realistic prior models that describe the non-linear dependencies between sedimentological parameters of deltaic systems can prevent the development of geologically unrealistic models. Multi-dimensional priors were generated using One-Class Support Vector Machine. This technique captures hidden relations of deltaic parameters: Delta Plane, Distributary Channel and Mouth bar dimensions. Variables were sampled from the realistic priors in order to assure facies realism. A Multiple Point Statistics (MPS) algorithm is used to model facies in a deltaic reservoir.

Due to appearance variations from different camera views, person re-identification still poses an important challenge. In the literature, KISSME has already been introduced as an effective distance metric learning method using pairwise constraints to improve the re-identification performance. Computationally, it only requires two inverse covariance matrix estimations. However, the linear transformation induced by KISSME is not powerful enough for more complex problems. We show that KISSME can be kernelized, resulting in a nonlinear transformation, which is suitable for many real-world applications. Moreover, the proposed kernel method can be used for learning distance metrics from structured objects without having a vectorial representation. The effectiveness of our method is validated on five publicly available data sets. To further apply the proposed kernel method efficiently when data are collected sequentially, we introduce a fast incremental version that learns a dissimilarity function in the feature space without estimating the inverse covariance matrices.

However, when data is not available, automatic methods are necessary to extract the underlying data from the chart images. This paper focuses on chart image classification, which is a fundamental step of chart analysis and data extraction. The performance of most conventional classifiers depends on the feature extraction technique applied, usually requiring a domain-specific design for creating the features. In this context, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has gained attention not only because it has achieved good results in many computer vision tasks but also because it can learn representations of images without the design of a feature extractor specific for a domain problem. Thereby, this paper proposes an evaluation of CNN architectures (VGG19, Resnet-50, and Inception-V3), comparing them with conventional classifiers (HOG features combined with KNN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine). An artificially generated dataset of 10 classes of chart images was used for training and testing.

As previously described, the system was capable of recognizing parametric surfaces of various types. We have added the ability to find parametric surface intersection curves and use these disparate types of information to index into an object database. From a depth map containing one or more objects, local surface and surface intersection curve estimates are determined. These are used in a series of layered and concurrent parameter space transforms to extract the surface and intersection curves present in the image. Any one transform computes only a partial geometric description that forms the input to the next transform. The final transform is a mapping into an object database. An iterative refinement technique, motivated by work in connectionist systems, is used to integrate the evidence at each level. One of the contributions of this system is that fundamentally different types of evidence can be simultaneously extracted, be mutually supportive in intermediate levels of the recognition process, and cooperate to form a consistent interpretation of the image.

The large number of images require automatic analysis, specifically to identify the lumen and outer vessel wall. However, the high amount of noise, the presence of artifacts and anatomical structures, such as bifurcations, calcifications and fibrotic plaques, usually hinder the proper automatic segmentation of the vessel wall. Methods Lumen, media, adventitia and surrounding tissues are automatically detected using Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The classification performance of the SVMs vary according to the kind of structure present within each region of the image. Random Forest (RF) is used to detect different morphological structures and to modify the initial layer classification depending on the detected structure. The resulting classification maps are fed into a segmentation method based on deformable contours to detect lumen-intima (LI) and media-adventitia (MA) interfaces. Results The modifications in the layer classifications according to the presence of structures proved to be effective improving LI and MA segmentations. The proposed method reaches a Jaccard Measure (JM) of 0.88 \u00b1 0.08 for LI segmentation, compared with 0.88 \u00b1 0.05 of a semiautomatic method. When looking at MA, our method reaches a JM of 0.84 \u00b1 0.09, and outperforms previous automatic methods in terms of HD, with 0.51mm \u00b1 0.30. Conclusions A simple modification to the arterial layer classification produces results that match and improve state-of-the-art fully-automatic segmentation methods for LI and MA in 20MHz IVUS images. For LI segmentation, the proposed automatic method performs accurately as semi-automatic methods. For MA segmentation, our method matched the quality of state-of-the-art automatic methods described in the literature.

To identify pirated or counterfeit software, software filtering systems need to measure software similarity when comparing a suspicious program with original ones. In this case, the comparison overhead might be very high because the suspicious program is compared with all programs in the database or market in the worst case. This paper proposes a software classification scheme for efficient software filtering systems. The scheme focuses specifically on the Windows portable executable files which have been prime targets for software pirates. The scheme extracts software characteristics from a suspicious program and classifies it into one of pre-defined categories quickly based on the characteristics. The suspicious program is compared only with the programs in the one of pre-defined categories in most cases; thus, the comparison overhead is reduced. We propose two classification methods.

This requirement makes the long training session inevitable for a new user. Many approaches including transfer learning (TL) already have been reported in the literature to abridge the long training data collection session. One of them is transferring informative instances using active learning (AL) which was approached in our previous attempts for both binary and multiclass BCI. It was associated with the classic common spatial pattern (CSP) feature extraction method. It showed the potential to obtain the benchmark performance using a reduced amount of training data. However, it has subject dependent performance and was not up to the expectation particularly for multiclass BCI. For binary BCI, it is addressed by selecting the best subject-specific features from subjective narrow frequency window using filter bank CSP (FBCSP). Since multiclass BCI has different characteristics in terms of output performance and nature of features, this work investigates the incorporation of FBCSP into informative transfer learning with AL (ITAL) for multiclass BCI. Comparing with existing direct transfer with AL (DTAL) and ITAL with CSP for multiclass BCI, ITAL with FBCSP reaches the benchmark performance for six out of nine subjects using average 42% of the full training set which is significant at 5% (p < 0.05) significance level. For multiclass BCI as well, ITAL combined with discriminating feature extraction ensures better transfer which yields to effective reduction of the training session without sacrificing the benchmark robustness.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/SMC.2018.00093", "venue": "2018 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)", "journal": "2018 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2909587838", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["62668597", "17571592", "13611222", "4697616", "36423320", "23703391", "16142276", "2709639", "214885890", "324600", "24491823", "21387597", "9243765", "3349131", "11661123", "12929342", "1550828", "2908770", "14656324", "14134274", "16768813", "60455038", "6535892", "7917980", "610960"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:58671731"}

This can not only reduce the scanning cost and ease patient burden, but also potentially reduce motion artefacts and the effect of contrast washout, thus yielding better image quality. Different from parallel imaging-based fast MRI, which utilizes multiple coils to simultaneously receive MR signals, CS-MRI breaks the Nyquist\u2013Shannon sampling barrier to reconstruct MRI images with much less required raw data. This paper provides a deep learning-based strategy for reconstruction of CS-MRI, and bridges a substantial gap between conventional non-learning methods working only on data from a single image, and prior knowledge from large training data sets. In particular, a novel conditional Generative Adversarial Networks-based model (DAGAN)-based model is proposed to reconstruct CS-MRI. In our DAGAN architecture, we have designed a refinement learning method to stabilize our U-Net based generator, which provides an end-to-end network to reduce aliasing artefacts. To better preserve texture and edges in the reconstruction, we have coupled the adversarial loss with an innovative content loss. In addition, we incorporate frequency-domain information to enforce similarity in both the image and frequency domains. We have performed comprehensive comparison studies with both conventional CS-MRI reconstruction methods and newly investigated deep learning approaches. Compared with these methods, our DAGAN method provides superior reconstruction with preserved perceptual image details.

The two major standing challenges from a clinical perspective that are related to this morbid phenomenon are (1) to establish the overall risk of SUDEP for a particular individual and (2) to elaborate a paradigm for accurate prediction and alerting for an imminent SUDEP event. In addition, as data available for SUDEP cases is sparse, a third challenge is to (3) develop a methodology that can find universal biomarkers reflecting the patient's condition independently of the type of measurements available (EEG, EMG, accelerometer, audio, video). Methods: In our group we have elaborated and tested a computational model based hypothesis relating the slowing of a major clonic seizure to possible post-ictal generalized electrographic suppression (PGES). To apply these findings to available clinical data, the approach proposed here is based on a combination of wavelet analysis and integral transformation techniques. It can be used in video sequences (after optical flow group parameters reconstruction) audio signals, EEG, EMG, accelerometer data and possibly other modalities to produce biomarkers characterizing the evolution of the ictal process independently from the sensor modality and acquisition parameters. To classify the PGES and possibly SUDEP cases we employed both supervised (Support Vector Machine - SVM) and unsupervised (Gaussian mixture model) . Results: We found three potential promising biomarkers: final inter-clonic time interval, total seizure duration and goodness of fit of the dominant Radon ridge. These biomarkers can be derived from any of the sensors or the combinations of their data, they are largely independent of the exact measurement modality and therefore offer robust paradigm for diagnostic and safety monitoring implementations.

Average activity type classification sensitivity with a decision tree classifier trained using land-based signals from one tri-axial accelerometer placed on lower back and leave-one-subject-out cross-validation scheme was 0.95 \u00b1 0.01 while classifying the activities performed on land, but decreased to 0.81 \u00b1 0.17 while classifying the activities on sea. An additional component produced by sea waves with a frequency of 0.3\u20130.8 Hz and a peak-to-peak amplitude of 2 m/s2 was noted in sea-based signals. Additional filtration methods were developed with the aim to remove the effect of sea waves using the least amount of computational power in order to create a suitable solution for real-time activity classification. The results of this study can be used to develop more precise physical activity classification methods in maritime areas or other locations where background affects the accelerometer signals.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-981-10-9023-3_3", "venue": "World Congress on Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering 2018", "journal": "World Congress on Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering 2018", "mag_id": "2809979010", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["57755062"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:64898197"}

Rule extraction from neural networks makes the interpretation of the behaviour of connectionist networks possible by relating sub-symbolic and symbolic process- ing. However, most rule extraction methods focus only on speci\u00afc neural network architectures and present limited generalization performance. Support Vector Machine is an unsupervised learning method that has been recently applied successfully in many areas, and o\u00aeers excellent generalization ability in comparison with other neural network, statistical, or symbolic machine learning models. In this thesis, an algorithm called Geometric and Oracle-Based Support Vector Machines Rule Extraction (GOSE) has been proposed to overcome the limitations of other rule-extraction methods by extracting comprehensible models from Support Vector Machines (SVM). This algorithm views the extraction as a geometric task. Given a trained SVM network, GOSE queries the synthetic instances and draws conjunction rules by approximating the optimization problem. The extracted rule set also represents the approximation of the SVM classi\u00afcation boundary. Unlike previous works in SVM rule-extraction, GOSE is broadly applicable to different networks and problems because it need not rely on training examples and network architectures. Theoretical proof guarantees that GOSE is capable of approximating the behavior of SVM networks. Empirical experiments are conducted on di\u00aeerent SVM networks from binary classification networks to multi-class networks in various classi\u00afcation domains. The result of experiments demonstrates that GOSE can extract comprehensible rules with high levels of accuracy and \u00afdelity for their corresponding networks. GOSE also exhibits superior consistency. After analyzing and applying several optimizing measures, the complexity of GOSE was improved. In brief, GOSE provides a novel way to explain how an SVM network functions.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1571730986", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7278900", "14614556", "56516364", "18691819", "1204938", "577580", "2961336", "6930911", "31790193", "9313065", "2397016", "63614204", "15645031", "28637672", "123503319", "16758337", "14931870"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9432886"}

Then, the SVM forecast results are corrected by the expectation of the forecast errors. The correlation coefficient matrix of wind generation forecast errors during forecast periods is estimated from historical SVM forecast errors. By combining the variance information obtained by SBL and the correlation coefficient matrix, the covariance matrix of the forecast errors within multiple successive forecast periods is formed. Thereby, the JPDF of wind generation is obtained. Data from an actual wind farm are used for the study.

The dimension of the extracted features are reduced by linear discrimination analysis (LDA) and classified by Support Vector Machine (SVM). The 600 sample from each group gave the best result using Support Vector Machine classifier. The maximum classification accuracy (90 %) with SVM clustering was achieved with the EEG Fz channel.

This paper presents a novel model using ELM in ciphering. The study begins with an investigation of the Real-time Recurrent Neural Network (RRNN) derived from the gradient-based learning for symmetric cipher. The weakness of this cipher is that the error converges to zero, and that the RRNN will not change regardless of how the plaintext is changed. Given the nature of the ELM, a technique with an ELM-based cipher is proposed to provide the capability of performing the training independently from the input and the error gradient. Different simulation scenarios were used to evaluate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed cipher. Results revealed that the ELM-based cipher performed better than RRNNs, especially in terms of security. Moreover, the ELM-based cipher demonstrated significantly competing performance for a wide range of evaluation measures. Using an ELM-based cipher instead of an AES or other type of ciphers has the added advantage of providing an addition level of security\u2014by allowing the user to change the algorithmic core of the cipher by simply changing the weights of the neural network. This allows hardware programmed ciphers to be more secure while costing less compared to other ciphers.

User mobility prediction in wireless communications can be exploited to overcome these foregoing challenges. Knowledge of where users will go next enables cellular networks to improve handover management. In addition, it allows networks to engage in advanced resource allocation and reservation, cell load prediction and proactive energy saving.

To achieve this goal, we propose a dynamic behavior inspection and analysis framework for malicious behavior detection. A customized Android system is built to record apps' API calls, permission uses, and some other runtime features. We also develop an automated app behavior inspection platform to install and inspect massive samples so as to collect apps' dynamic behavior records. Then these records are exploited to train a string subsequence kernel\u2013based Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, which can be used to classify benign and malicious behaviors offline. To realize online detection, we further extract apps' runtime features including sensitive permission combination uses, sensitive behavior sequences, and user interactions for behavior classification. The classification results can reach an accuracy of 84.9% in offline phase and 99.0% in online phase.

In this paper, a new service recommendation method is proposed based on user's interest, which combines collaborative filtering based on multiply users and random forest based on single user, and this fusion method uses cross validation model. This method can improve cold start and pick up speed. Experiment results show that the method can discover users' interest efficiently and is more accurate. This method can combine two basic methods so that the result is more accurate.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2991/mcei-15.2015.5", "venue": "Proceedings of the International Conference on Management, Computer and Education Informatization", "journal": "Proceedings of the International Conference on Management, Computer and Education Informatization", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2290470760", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["63309902", "7285098", "167952694", "47141157", "2300141", "435521", "109137851", "110344580", "122978934"], "inbound_citations": ["133604023"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61679149"}

This resulted in a platform that, under the tested conditions, resulted in high classification accuracy, in excess of 95%. The current paper is aimed at determining the extent to which the classification accuracy could be attributed to the use of the algorithm employed.

Traditionally the classification algorithms would have to digest a stationary set of historical data in order to train up a decision-tree model and the learned model could then be used for testing new samples. However, a new breed of classification called stream-based classification can handle continuous data streams, which are ever evolving, unbound, and unstructured, for instance--biosignal live feeds. These emerging algorithms can potentially be used for real-time classification over biosignal data streams like EEG and ECG, etc. This paper presents a pioneer effort that studies the feasibility of classification algorithms for analyzing biosignals in the forms of infinite data streams. First, a performance comparison is made between traditional and stream-based classification. The results show that accuracy declines intermittently for traditional classification due to the requirement of model re-learning as new data arrives. Second, we show by a simulation that biosignal data streams can be processed with a satisfactory level of performance in terms of accuracy, memory requirement, and speed, by using a collection of stream-mining algorithms called Optimized Very Fast Decision Trees.

However, two drawbacks still exist. One is that word embeddings are pre-trained by unidirectional language modeling objectives. Thus the word embeddings only contain left-to-right context information. The other is that POS tags are provided by an external POS tagger. So computation cost will be increased and incorrect predicted tags may affect the performance of restoring punctuation marks during decoding. This paper proposes adversarial transfer learning to address these problems. A pre-trained bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model is used to initialize a punctuation model. Thus the transferred model parameters carry both left-to-right and right-to-left representations. Furthermore, adversarial multi-task learning is introduced to learn task invariant knowledge for punctuation prediction. We use an extra POS tagging task to help the training of the punctuation predicting task. Adversarial training is utilized to prevent the shared parameters from containing task specific information. We only use the punctuation predicting task to restore marks during decoding stage. Therefore, it will not need extra computation and not introduce incorrect tags from the POS tagger. Experiments are conducted on IWSLT2011 datasets.

Spam increase the load on the servers and the bandwidth of the ISPs and the added cost to handle this load must be compensated by the customers. In addition, the time spent by people in reading and deleting the spam emails is a waste. As a result of this growing problem, automated methods for filtering such junk from legitimate E-mail are becoming necessary. Automatic email spam classification contains more challenges because of unstructured information, more number of features and large number of documents.

Each tree votes on an overall classification for the given set of data and the random forest algorithm chooses the individual classification with the most votes.

The decision hyperplane of SVM is determined by the most informative data instances, called Support Vectors (SVs). In practice, these SVMs are a subset of the entire training data. By now, SVMs have been successfully applied in many applications, such as face detection, handwritten digit recognition, text classification, and data mining. Osuna et al. (1997) applied SVMs for face detection. Heisele et al. (2004) achieved high face detection rate by using 2nd degree SVM. They applied hierarchical classification and feature reduction methods to speed up face detection using SVMs. Feature extraction and reduction are two primary issues in feature selection that is essential in pattern classification. Whether it is for storage, searching, or classification, the way the data are represented can significantly influence performances. Feature extraction is a process of extracting more effective representation of objects from raw data to achieve high classification rates. For image data, many kinds of features have been used, such as raw pixel values, Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), wavelet features, Gabor features, and gradient values. Feature reduction is a process of selecting a subset of features with preservation or improvement of classification rates. In general, it intends to speed up the classification process by keeping the most important class-relevant features.

In this article, we show how stochastic gradient boosting regression can be successfully extended to the modeling of spiking activity data while preserving their point process nature, thus providing a robust nonparametric modeling tool. We formulate stochastic gradient boosting in terms of approximating the conditional intensity function of a point process in discrete time and use the standard likelihood of the process to derive the loss function for the approximation problem. To illustrate the approach, we apply the algorithm to the modeling of primary motor and parietal spiking activity as a function of spiking history and kinematics during a two-dimensional reaching task. Model selection, goodness of fit via the time rescaling theorem, model interpretation via partial dependence plots, ranking of covariates according to their relative importance, and prediction of peri-event time histograms are illustrated and discussed. Additionally, we use the tenfold cross-validated log likelihood of the modeled neural processes (67 cells) to compare the performance of gradient boosting regression to two alternative approaches: standard generalized linear models (GLMs) and Bayesian P-splines with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. In our data set, gradient boosting outperformed both Bayesian P-splines (in approximately 90% of the cells) and GLMs (100%). Because of its good performance and computational efficiency, we propose stochastic gradient boosting regression as an off-the-shelf nonparametric tool for initial analyses of large neural data sets (e.g., more than 50 cells; more than 10(5) samples per cell) with corresponding multidimensional covariate spaces (e.g., more than four covariates).

However, similar radiographic appearance of jaw lesions causes difficulties in differentiating cyst from tumor. Therefore, we conducted a development of computer-aided classification system for cyst and tumor lesions in dental panoramic images. The proposed system consists of feature extraction based on texture using the first-order statistics texture (FO), Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Gray Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM). In this work, there were thirty three features which were classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classification. The result shows that differentiation of cyst from tumor lesions can achieve accuracy up to 87.18% and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC) curve up to 0.9444. When using the number of features used as predictors, the highest accuracy obtained were 8462% using FO, 61.54% using GLCM, 76.92% using GLRLM, 84.62% using the combination of FO and GLCM, 87.18% using the combination of FO and GLRLM, 75.56% using the combination of GLCM and GLRLM, and 87.18% using the combination of FO, GLCM and GLRLM.

The identification system combines three weak visual cues, and exploits both temporal and mutual exclusion constraints in a Conditional Random Field (CRF). In addition, we propose a novel Linear Programming (LP) Relaxation algorithm for predicting the best player identification in a video clip. In order to reduce the number of labeled training data required to learn the identification system, we make use of weakly supervised learning with the assistance of play-by-play texts. Experiments show promising results in tracking, homography estimation, and identification.

Two different features of laser-induced plasma, spectral line-intensity-ratio, and both spectral line-intensity-ratio and spectral integrated intensity were used to train the SVR. Composition measurements using a calibration curve method, partial least square regression, and artificial neural networks are also performed for comparison. The results show that the SVR with both spectral line-intensity-ratio and spectral integrated intensity as inputs has the best performance due to linearly separable point clusters in the high-dimensional space. Laser power independent composition prediction is achieved and real-time composition predictions are validated.

An efficient selection procedure for Lagrange multipliers is given, and two heuristics for improving the SMO procedure are described: block optimization and annealing of the regularization parameter epsilon. A comparison of the variants shows that the dual SMO, including block optimization and annealing, performs efficiently in terms of computation time.

This non-sparse nature of models results in slow inference. Thus, there is a need to devise new algorithms for sparse SSVM and CRF classifier design. Use of elastic net and L1-regularizer has already been explored for solving primal CRF and SSVM problems, respectively, to design sparse classifiers. In this work, we focus on dual elastic net regularized SSVM and CRF. By exploiting the weakly coupled structure of these convex programming problems, we propose a new sequential alternating proximal (SAP) algorithm to solve these dual problems. This algorithm works by sequentially visiting each training set example and solving a simple subproblem restricted to a small subset of variables associated with that example.

Although machine learning models perform reasonably well, they may not rely on meaningful features, nor lend themselves to physical interpretation of the classification rules. This lack of interpretability and control over classification outcomes is of particular concern where different behaviours have different frequency of occurrence and duration, as in most natural systems, and calls for the development of alternative methods. Biomechanical approaches to human activity classification could overcome these shortcomings, yet their full potential remains untapped for animal studies. ::: We propose a general framework for behaviour recognition using accelerometers, and develop a hybrid model where (a) biomechanical features characterise movement dynamics, and (b) a node\u2010based hierarchical classification scheme employs simple machine learning algorithms at each node to find feature\u2010value thresholds separating different behaviours. Using triaxial accelerometer data collected on 10 wild Kalahari meerkats, and annotated video recordings of each individual as groundtruth, this hybrid model was validated in three scenarios: (a) when each behaviour was equally represented (EQDIST), (b) when naturally imbalanced datasets were considered (STRAT) and (c) when data from new individuals were considered (LOIO). ::: A linear\u2010kernel Support Vector Machine at each node of our classification scheme yielded an overall accuracy of >95% for each scenario.

In this paper, we propose to model an image set as a fully connected pairwise Conditional Random Field (CRF) defined over the image pixels, or superpixels, with Gaussian edge potentials. We show that this lets us co-label the images of a large set efficiently, thus yielding increased accuracy at no additional computational cost compared to sequential labeling of the images.

Patients who have bariatric surgery, are exposed to complications after surgery. Furthermore, the mid- to long-term complications after bariatric surgery can be deadly and increase the complexity of managing safety of these operations and healthcare costs. Current studies on BAR complications have mainly used risk scoring for identifying patients who are more likely to have complications after surgery. Though, these studies do not take into consideration the imbalanced nature of the data where the size of the class of interest (patients who have complications after surgery) is relatively small. We propose the use of imbalanced classification techniques to tackle the imbalanced bariatric surgery data: synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), random undersampling, and ensemble learning classification methods including Random Forest, Bagging, and AdaBoost. Moreover, we improve classification performance through using Chi-squared, Information Gain, and Correlation-based feature selection techniques. We study the Premier Healthcare Database with focus on the most-frequent complications including Diabetes, Angina, Heart Failure, and Stroke. Our results show that the ensemble learning-based classification techniques using any feature selection method mentioned above are the best approach for handling the imbalanced nature of the bariatric surgical outcome data. In our evaluation, we find a slight preference toward using SMOTE method compared to the random undersampling method.

In this way the model is able to track the long-term trend and in the same time it smooths out short-term variation due to noise. We use the Kernel Spectral Clustering with Memory effect (MKSC) which allows to predict cluster memberships of new nodes via out-of-sample extension and has a proper model selection scheme. It is based on a constrained optimization formulation typical of Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVM), where the objective function is designed to explicitly incorporate temporal smoothness as a valid prior knowledge. The latter, in fact, allows the model to cluster the current data well and to be consistent with the recent history. Here we propose a generalization of the MKSC model with an arbitrary memory, not only one time-step in the past. The experiments conducted on toy problems confirm our expectations: the more memory we add to the model, the smoother over time are the clustering results.

MR images can also be used to track the size of a brain tumor as it responds (or doesn't) to treatment. A reliable method for segmenting tumor would clearly be a useful tool. Currently, however, there is no method widely accepted in clinical practice for quantitating tumor volumes from MR images. Tese manual measurements, have shown poor reproducibility and tumor response criteria based on these manual estimations have shown poor correlation with quantitative 2D and 3D metrics. Computer-based brain tumor segmentation has remained largely experimental work, with approaches including multi-spectral analysis, edge detection, neural networks, and knowledge-based techniques.

To interpret voice command, systems must be able to extract the meaning from natural language; this task is called Natural Language Understanding (NLU). Modern NLU is based on statistical models which are trained on data. However, a current limitation of most NLU statistical models is the dependence on large amount of textual data aligned with target semantic labels. This is highly time-consuming. Moreover, they require training several separate models for predicting intents, slot-labels and slot-values. In this paper, we propose to use a sequence-to-sequence neural architecture to train NLU models which do not need aligned data and can jointly learn the intent, slot-label and slot-value prediction tasks. This approach has been evaluated both on a voice command dataset we acquired for the purpose of the study as well as on a publicly available dataset.

A co-membership attack checks whether the given bundle of n instances were in the training, with the prior knowledge that the bundle was either entirely used in the training or none at all. Successful membership attacks can compromise the privacy of training data when the generative model is published. Our main idea is to cast membership inference of target data x as the optimization of another neural network (called the attacker network) to search for the latent encoding to reproduce x. The final reconstruction error is used directly to conclude whether x was in the training data or not.

Their performances degrade drastically when expression images are taken from different cultures. Moreover, there are many existing facial expression patterns which cannot be generated and used as training data in single training session.

In recent years, interest has been rising in the use of phonological features derived from these acoustic frequency features in addition to, or in place of, the acoustic frequency features themselves. These phonological features are derived from the manner that speech is physically produced in the vocal tract of the speaker, rather than models of how speech is heard by the listener. ::: Integrating phonological features into ASR models presents new challenges. The mathematical assumptions made to build current models may work well for features derived from acoustic frequencies, but do not necessarily fit phonological features as nicely.

Particularly, we evaluate the performance of the Water Cloud Model (WCM) to estimate the LAI of corn using VV and VH backscatter derived from RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1 satellites over two test sites (Canada and Poland). We tested the performance of four different approaches to invert the WCM. These are: (a) iterative optimization (IO), (b) Look-up table (LUT) search, (c) Support Vector Regression (SVR) and (d) Random Forest Regression (RFR). The accuracy of each inversion was measured by comparing the estimates from the WCM to the LAI of corn measured in-situ. Our results indicated that the inversion of the WCM using the SVR method delivered the best performance, yielding a correlation (r-value) between estimated and measured LAI of 0.92 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.677 m 2 m \u22122 . The other approaches produced higher errors, with the LUT search resulting in the greatest error (RMSE of 0.977 m 2 m \u22122 ).

This process may accelerate convergence to local optima. This paper investigates a method to diminish this convergence pressure by applying \u201cdetailed balance\u201d to the Population Based Incremental Learning (PBIL) algorithm [4]. Detailed balance is a well-known condition in Markov chains. Basically, it says that, on a flat fitness landscape, the probability of going from a state i to a state j must be the same as the probability of going backwards from state j to state i. This condition slows the rate of convergence of the probability parameters when the landscape is flat.

We give some experimental results which show that syllables can be effectively used in text-categorisation problems. In this paper we also propose two extensions to the string kernel.

For the addressed approach, a clustering algorithm is first used to generate clustering-based intervals. A support vector regression (SVR) is then exploited to forecast the passenger flow for each cluster, with the use of particle swarm optimization (PSO) for obtaining the optimized parameters. Finally, the prediction results of the SVR are rearranged by chronological order rearrangement. The proposed model is tested using real bus passenger data from a bus line over four months.

These hidden channels violate network security and privacy polices, it is easy to embed but unlikely and almost impossible to be detected. ::: ::: ::: Despite of the obvious improvements in IPv6 components and functionality enhancements, there exist intrinsic security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities have ongoing implications on network security and traffic performance. Hence, they will create insecure environments in business and banking network, information security management and IT security. ICMPv6 is vital integral part in IPv6, as well as IPsec protocol, to mitigate and eliminate covert channels, the RFC standards and controls should be investigated intensively. Furthermore, incomplete implementation of IPv6 nowadays on all Operating Systems has not exposed the realm of this security protocol performance explicitly. ::: ::: In this thesis, we present a novel Hybrid Heuristic Intelligent Algorithm coupled with enhanced Polynomial Naive Bayes machine Learning algorithm. The framework is implemented in a supervised learning model to detect and classify covert channels in IPv6. The proposed multi-threaded framework acts as an active security warden processing intelligent information gain and optimized decision trees technique to improve the security vulnerabilities in this new network generation protocol. ::: ::: This new approach develops intelligent heuristic techniques for in depth packet inspection to analyse and examine the header fields of IPv6 protocol. Some of these fields are designated by the designer for quality of service (QoS), future performance diagnostic analysis, unfortunately, they are misused by \"bad guys and black hats\" to perform various network security attacks against vulnerable targets. These attacks cause immediate and ongoing damage to classified data. In order to prevent and mitigate these types of breaches and threat risks, a multi-security prevention model was created. Furthermore, advanced machine learning technique was implemented to detect, classify and document all current and future unknown anomaly attacks. The suggested HeuBNet6 classiffier obtained highly significant results of 98% detection rate and showed better performance and accuracy with good True Positive Rate (TPR) and low False Positive Rate (FPR).", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2741926605", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54535417"}

Supervised cross-modal hashing methods have achieved considerable progress by incorporating semantic side information. However, they heavily rely on large-scale labeled cross-modal training data which are hard to obtain, since multiple modalities are involved. They also ignore the rich information contained in the large amount of unlabeled data across different modalities, which can help to model the correlations between different modalities. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised cross-modal hashing approach by generative adversarial network (SCH-GAN). The main contributions can be summarized as follows: 1) we propose a novel generative adversarial network for cross-modal hashing, in which the generative model tries to select margin examples of one modality from unlabeled data when given a query of another modality (e.g., giving a text query to retrieve images and vice versa). The discriminative model tries to distinguish the selected examples and true positive examples of the query. These two models play a minimax game so that the generative model can promote the hashing performance of the discriminative model and 2) we propose a reinforcement learning-based algorithm to drive the training of proposed SCH-GAN. The generative model takes the correlation score predicted by discriminative model as a reward, and tries to select the examples close to the margin to promote a discriminative model.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to auto-tune the configuration parameters for a given HBase application, called Auto-Tuning HBase (ATH). The key is an accurate performance model with low cost, which takes configuration parameters as inputs. To this end, we systematically explore different modeling techniques and decide to employ an ensemble learning algorithm to build the performance model. Subsequently, we leverage genetic algorithm to search the optimal configuration parameters for the application by using the performance model. As such, ATH can quickly as well as automatically identify a set of configuration parameter values to make the performance of the application optimal. We validate ATH in a cluster with ten nodes by using five typical applications from Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark. The experimental results show that ATH can improve throughput by 41% on average and up to 97% compared with the default configurations.

The datasets utilized in this experiment are two. Firstly, a collection of 1427 X-ray images including 224 images with confirmed Covid-19 disease, 700 images with confirmed common bacterial pneumonia, and 504 images of normal conditions. Secondly, a dataset including 224 images with confirmed Covid-19 disease, 714 images with confirmed bacterial and viral pneumonia, and 504 images of normal conditions. The data was collected from the available X-ray images on public medical repositories. The results suggest that Deep Learning with X-ray imaging may extract significant biomarkers related to the Covid-19 disease, while the best accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity obtained is 96.78%, 98.66%, and 96.46% respectively. Since by now, all diagnostic tests show failure rates such as to raise concerns, the probability of incorporating X-rays into the diagnosis of the disease could be assessed by the medical community, based on the findings, while more research to evaluate the X-ray approach from different aspects may be conducted.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2003.11617", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC7118364", "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s13246-020-00865-4", "venue": "Physical and Engineering Sciences in Medicine 2020", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3013601031", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine", "Engineering", "Physics"], "outbound_citations": ["5501470", "53304118", "214668039", "3516426", "3761015", "2930547", "14124313", "12670695", "1023605", "2375110", "15539264", "14832074", "6628106"], "inbound_citations": ["215415846", "214802290", "214802801", "215238524", "214743472"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214667149"}

It is estimated that at least 23 million of European citizens are affected by alcoholism causing a cost around 270 million euros. Excessive alcohol consumption is related with physical harm and, although it damages the most of body organs, liver, pancreas, and brain are more severally affected. Not only physical harm is associated to alcohol-related disorders, but also other psychiatric disorders such as depression are often comorbiding. As well, alcohol is present in many of violent behaviors and traffic injures. Altogether reflects the high complexity of alcohol-related disorders suggesting the involvement of multiple brain systems. With the emergence of non-invasive diagnosis techniques such as neuroimaging or EEG, many neurobiological factors have been evidenced to be fundamental in the acquisition and maintenance of addictive behaviors, relapsing risk, and validity of available treatment alternatives. Alterations in brain structure and function reflected in non-invasive imaging studies have been repeatedly investigated. However, the extent to which imaging measures may precisely characterize and differentiate pathological stages of the disease often accompanied by other pathologies is not clear. The use of animal models has elucidated the role of neurobiological mechanisms paralleling alcohol misuses. Thus, combining animal research with non-invasive neuroimaging studies is a key tool in the advance of the disorder understanding. As the volume of data from very diverse nature available in clinical and research settings increases, an integration of data sets and methodologies is required to explore multidimensional aspects of psychiatric disorders. Complementing conventional mass-variate statistics, interests in predictive power of statistical machine learning to neuroimaging data is currently growing among scientific community. This doctoral thesis has covered most of the aspects mentioned above. Starting from a well-established animal model in alcohol research, Marchigian Sardinian rats, we have performed multimodal neuroimaging studies at several stages of alcohol-experimental design including the etiological mechanisms modulating high alcohol consumption (in comparison to Wistar control rats), alcohol consumption, and treatment with the opioid antagonist Naltrexone, a well-established drug in clinics but with heterogeneous response. Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging acquisition included Diffusion Tensor Imaging, structural imaging, and the calculation of magnetic-derived relaxometry maps. We have designed an analytical framework based on widely used algorithms in neuroimaging field, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine, combined in a wrapping fashion. Designed approach was applied on the same dataset with two different aims: exploring the validity of the approach to discriminate experimental stages running at subject-level and establishing predictive models at voxel-level to identify key anatomical regions modified during the experiment course. As expected, combination of multiple magnetic resonance imaging modalities resulted in an enhanced predictive power (between 3 and 16%) with heterogeneous modality contribution. Surprisingly, we have identified some inborn alterations correlating high alcohol preference and thalamic neuroadaptations related to Naltrexone efficacy. As well, reproducible contribution of DTI and relaxometry -related biomarkers has been repeatedly identified guiding further studies in alcohol research. In summary, along this research we demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating multimodal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and animal research in the advance of the understanding alcohol-related disorders.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4995/Thesis/10251/90523", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2768093223", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:149111632"}

To maximise the local information, a multiresolution approach is employed followed by dimensionality reduction by selecting dominant patterns only. Subsequently, the Support Vector Machine classifier is used to perform the classification and a stratified ten-fold cross-validation scheme is employed to evaluate the performance of the method.

The inter-annual variability of monsoon rainfalls is high, which forces South Indian farmers to adapt their irrigated area extents to local water availability. We are developing and testing an automatic methodology for monitoring spatio-temporal variations of irrigated crops in near real time based on Sentinel-1 and -2 data feed over the Telangana State, South India. These freely available radar and optical data are systematically acquired worldwide, over India since 2016, on a weekly basis. Their high spatial resolution (10\u201320 m) are well adapted to the small size field crops that is common in India. We have focused first on drought prone areas, North of Hyderabad. Crop fraction remains low and varies widely (from 10 to 60%, ISRO-NRSC, Bhuvan). Those upstream areas, mainly irrigated with groundwater, are composed by less than 20% of irrigated areas during the dry season (Rabi, December to March) and up to 60% of the surface is used for crop production during the Kharif (June to November), which includes rainfed cotton and drip irrigated maize crops and inundated rice. A machine learning algorithm, the Random Forest (RF) method, was automatically used over 6 growing seasons (January to March and July to November, from 2016 to 2018) from the Sentinel-1&2 data stacked for each season, to create crop mapping at 10 m resolution over a study area located in the north of Hyderabad (210 by 110 km). Six seasonal land cover field surveys were used to train and validate the classifier, with a specific effort on rice and maize field sampling. The lowest irrigated area extents were found for driest conditions in Rabi 2016 and Kharif 2016, accounting for 3.5 and 5% with moderate classification confusion. This confusion decreases with the increase of irrigated crops areas during Rabi 2017. For this season, 22% of rice and 9% of irrigated crops were detected after heavy rainfall events in September 2017, which have filled surface water tanks (3.4% of the surface area) and groundwater (Central Groundwater Board observations). From this abundance situation, the surface water detected for each season decreased regularly to less than 0.3% together with the rice and irrigated area extents respectively from 22 to 11% and 10 to 3%, despite a good monsoon 2017. Groundwater level show similar trends, with a drop from 20 meters depth in October 2016 and 2017 to more than 30 m in June 2018 (more recent available data). The deficit of the monsoon 2018 will certainly bring this situation to a hydrological drought at the beginning of 2019, probably similar to the Rabi 2016 situation. The estimated Irrigated Water Demand (IWD) varies from 51 to 310 mm/season, depending on water availability. This methodology shows the potential of automatically monitoring, in near real time, with standard computers, irrigated area extents presenting fast high resolution variability. As it is based on standard global satellite acquisitions, it is foreseen to be used for other regions, for any studies on farmer\u2019s adaptation to climate and hydrological variability, as a proxy to estimate irrigation water needs and water resources availability. In Telangana for instance, it provides an inventory of crop production and irrigation practices before the implementation of mega project infrastructures funded by this new state: - the K\u00e2k\u00e2tiya tank restoration program to enhance monsoon runoff capture or the Kaleshwaram project to divert Godavari river water toward upstream Telangana region through tunnels and canals in 20 giant reservoirs.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-3-W6-285-2019", "venue": null, "journal": "ISPRS - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2965486335", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science"], "outbound_citations": ["128895580", "128526111", "127393585", "89141", "140684455", "128900792", "36932236", "132204482", "101548718", "11569961", "140584531", "34932756", "54997205", "140543214", "5912762", "9895031", "132993057", "131324512", "3559690", "128432768", "60875039"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201323879"}

It can detect fall of the human without hardware modification, extra environmental setup, or any wearable device. We implement WiFall on desktops equipped with commodity 802.11n NIC, and evaluate the performance in three typical indoor scenarios with several layouts of transmitter-receiver (Tx-Rx) links. In our area of interest, WiFall can achieve fall detection for a single person with high accuracy. As demonstrated by the experimental results, WiFall yields 90 percent detection precision with a false alarm rate of 15 percent on average using a one-class SVM classifier in all testing scenarios.

Recent improvements in 3D imaging technology, among them development of micro-CT and micro-MRI scanners, allow in-vivo 3D high-resolution scanning and reconstruction of large specimens or even whole bone models. Thus, the tendency today is to evaluate bone features using 3D assessment techniques rather than traditional 2D methods. For this purpose high quality meshing methods are required. However, the 3D meshes produced from current commercial systems usually are of low quality with respect to analysis and rapid prototyping. 3D model reconstruction of bone is difficult due to the complexity of bone micro-structure. The small bone features lead to a great deal of neighborhood ambiguity near each vertex. The relatively new Neural Network method for mesh reconstruction has the potential to create or remesh 3D models accurately and quickly. A Neural Network (NN), which resembles an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm, is a set of interconnected neurons, where each neuron is capable of making an autonomous arithmetic calculation. Moreover, each neuron is affected by its surrounding neurons through the structure of the network. This paper proposes an extension of the Growing Neural Gas Neural Network (GNG NN) technique for remeshing a triangular manifold mesh that represents bone micro structure.

The RSVM is shown to be more robust to outliers and to deliver more accurate classifiers using a smaller set of SVs than the standard SVM.

The current study proposes a novel hybrid model for diabetic prediction by using data mining techniques. The main objective of this study is to improve the accuracy rate by significantly reducing the size of the data under analysis at every stage. Methods/Statistical Analysis: To achieve the objectives, the PIMA Female Diabetic dataset, extracted from UCI repository, is used. The 10-fold cross validation method is used for extracting the testing and the training samples. Three rank based selection techniques are used for the attribute selection. The association between different attributes is identified and then clustering is performed under criticality using HMM and Fuzzy improved Neural Network. Findings: The data size reduces significantly when appropriate selection methods are applied in the respective sequence. For categorical data, the gain ratio attribute selection method out performs. Clustering is more effective when performed after identifying the exact associations among attributes. The proposed hybrid model achieved 92% of overall accuracy. The blend of supervised and un-supervised techniques achieved better results than the techniques when applied individually on the same data, as figured by the comparative analysis. The earlier prediction models worked either on classification or clustering. But in this present study, the classifiers and the clustering are performed. The Fuzzy improved Neural Networks are used for predicting the diabetes disease over the data. The result analysis proved that the prediction accuracy is poor (Naive Bayes: 76.30%, Neural Networks: 75.13, Support Vector Machine: 77.47, K-Nearest neighbor: 69.79, Decision Tree (J48): 74.21), when the classifiers are implemented separately but when these are amalgamated with each other, produces better results. Application/ Improvements: The proposed hybrid model can be used as an expert system application, under the guidance of diabetic expert to assist the physicians for taking the decisions regarding the early diagnosis of the disease.

Local organizations of image directions at several scales drive the process of creating discriminative lung tissue texture signatures using spatial and Fourier domain information extracted from the images. The signatures are generated for four diseased tissue classes and healthy tissue, all of which appear in the Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) database, using a novel one-versus-one approach for learning discriminative filter signatures. A multiclass tissue classification accuracy of 80.31% is observed using Radial Basis Function (RBF) Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The presented method compares well against a variety of state-of-the-art approaches. Another strong feature of our approach is the ability to access the individual class probabilities before a final classification decision is made. This enables an analysis of the causes of misclassification in this paper. We also make the case against total reliance on the accuracy of the ground truth given that the ILD database only contains a single label for a specific region and sometimes more than one pattern can be present, particularly for regions classified as healthy tissue.

Numerous static and dynamic techniques have been reported so far for categorizing malwares. This research work presents a deep learning based malware detection (DLMD) technique based on static methods for classifying different malware families. The proposed DLMD technique uses both the byte and ASM files for feature engineering and thus classifying malwares families. First, features are extracted from byte files using two different types of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). After that, important and discriminative opcode features are selected using a wrapper-based mechanism, where Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used as a classifier. The idea is to construct a hybrid feature space by combining the different feature spaces in order that the shortcoming of a particular feature space may be overcome by another feature space. And consequently to reduce the chances of missing a malware. Finally, the hybrid feature space is then used to train a Multilayer Perceptron, which classifies all the nine different malware families. Experimental results show that proposed DLMD technique achieves log-loss of 0.09 for ten independent runs. Moreover, the performance of the proposed DLMD technique is compared against different classifiers and shows its effectiveness in categorizing malwares.

Recent iris recognition systems have focused on images acquired in unconstrained environments. Unconstrained imaging environments allow the capture of iris images at a distance, in motion and under visible wavelength illumination which lead to more noise factors such as off-focus, gaze deviation, and obstruction by eyelids, eyeglasses, hair, lighting and specular reflections. Segmenting irises taken in an unconstrained environment remains a challenging task for iris recognition. In this paper, a new iris segmentation method is developed and tested on UBIRIS.v2 and MICHE iris databases that reflect the challenges in recognition by unconstrained images. This method accurately localizes the iris by a model designed on the basis of the Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) descriptor and Support Vector Machine (SVM), namely HOG-SVM. Based on this localization, iris texture is automatically extracted by means of a cellular automata which evolved via the GrowCut technique. Pre- and post-processing operations are also introduced to ensure higher segmentation accuracy.

Majority of the data collected from such systems typically exhibits normal operating behaviours. This phenomenon inadvertently creates an imbalance between the class distributions of the data. The imbalance ratio may fall in the range of 1\u2236100 to 1\u22361000 for every fault condition data available. The nature of such datasets thus makes it harder to build reliable models for accurate fault diagnosis in Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) due to the lack of learning exemplars of the fault class. Conventional machine learning algorithms do not handle imbalanced datasets well and generally would produce poor classification results. To improve the fault diagnosis reliability on class-imbalanced datasets, this paper proposes a hybrid rebalancing approach called Hybrid Support Vector Machine (SVM) under sampling with Mega Trend Diffusion (MTD) oversampling. Our proposed approach rebalances the dataset by (1) Reducing the amount of normal condition data whilst retaining the most informative ones and (2) Boosting the number of fault condition data to match the size of the normal data. This approach is highly applicable to the manufacturing setting as there is a level of predictability to the nature of data, i.e. data of different fault conditions tend to cluster together in the feature space. Thus, manipulating the data at this level is a logical step. As such, learning effectively with the limited available fault data can translate to significantly cost-saving. Our approach is demonstrated and validated with a case study on bearing fault detection.

This thermal PDVP imaging based human recognition methodology has been specifically employed to encounter the challenging crisis of intrusion posed by imposters. To address the Small Sample Size (SSS) problem, intrinsic to many biometric applications, each image is transformed into multiple patches, leading to an increase in the total number of samples. In a bid to make the classification strategy less sensitive to the choice of patch-size, the present paper proposes a new enhanced ensemble learning for the patch based CRC (PCRC) algorithm, where margin maximization is carried out using exponential squared loss minimization. This work also proposes how this loss minimization can be achieved by a stochastic optimization algorithm and solves this problem using artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. In this context, a new ABC variant, called modified interactive artificial bee colony (MI-ABC) algorithm, has also been proposed, which has been demonstrated to outperform the basic ABC and its several modern variants. The proposed methodology has been implemented on a wellstructured real database, developed in our laboratory using real subjects, and the results obtained in implementation phase clearly demonstrate that our proposed method could outperform its several competitors and achieve substantially high classification rates, for the problem under consideration.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.engappai.2017.02.002", "venue": "Eng.

Assuming that the class conditional densities are mixture distributions, where each component of the mixture has a spherical covariance, the second order statistics of the components can be estimated efficiently using clustering algorithms like BIRCH. For each cluster, the second order moments are used to derive a second order cone constraint via a Chebyshev-Cantelli inequality. This constraint ensures that any data point in the cluster is classified correctly with a high probability. This leads to a large margin SOCP formulation whose size depends on the number of clusters rather than the number of training data points.

In this work, we study how the multimodal expressions of emotion change when an individual is under varying levels of stress. We hypothesize that stress produces modulations that can hide the true underlying emotions of individuals and that we can make emotion recognition algorithms more generalizable by controlling for variations in stress. To this end, we use adversarial networks to decorrelate stress modulations from emotion representations. We study how stress alters acoustic and lexical emotional predictions, paying special attention to how modulations due to stress affect the transferability of learned emotion recognition models across domains. Our results show that stress is indeed encoded in trained emotion classifiers and that this encoding varies across levels of emotions and across the lexical and acoustic modalities. Our results also show that emotion recognition models that control for stress during training have better generalizability when applied to new domains, compared to models that do not control for stress during training.

One algorithm called PAD, for Probabilistic Anomaly Detection, is based upon a probability density estimation while the second uses the Support Vector Machine framework. The key idea behind the detector is to first train a model of normal Registry behavior on a Windows host, even when noise may be present in the training data, and use this model to detect abnormal Registry accesses. At run-time the model is used to check each access to the Registry in real-time to determine whether or not the behavior is abnormal and possibly corresponds to an attack.

The two varieties of the lichen Squamarina cartilaginea known to occur in Italy (var. cartilaginea and var. pseudocrassa), which are morphologically indistinguishable, can be identified only by a medullar chemical spot test. In this paper, SDMs are used to support the separation of these two varieties, to determine whether they are also characterized by a differential spatial distribution. Occurrence data were obtained by geo-referencing a posteriori 114 herbarium specimens identified to variety level by a medullar spot test. The spatial distribution was modeled by using Random Forest (RF) and Generalized Linear Models. Suitability areas were obtained by applying the 0% omission error criterion in the probability map produced by RF, which proved to be the more statistically reliable of the two methods. Kendall's tau statistic test applied to RF suitability maps indicates that the two varieties tend to segregate ecologically in the Italian peninsula. Var. pseudocrassa appears to be more widespread in the Mediterranean region, as well as in coastal and hilly areas, while var. cartilaginea is more abundant in the temperate region and mountainous areas. For both varieties the spatial distribution is determined by similar climatic variables (mean yearly temperature, mean temperature of the coldest month and summer precipitation). These findings lead to a new hypothesis on the role of these environmental factors on the evolutionary history and geographical distribution of the two varieties.

Understanding how the millions of SNPs in the human genome are involved in conferring susceptibility or resistance to disease, or in rendering a drug efficacious or toxic in the individual is a major goal of the relatively new fields of pharmacogenomics. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is a high-mortality cancer with complex etiology and progression involving both genetic and environmental factors. We examined the association between esophageal cancer risk and patterns of 61 SNPs in a case-control study for a population from Shanxi Province in North Central China that has among the highest rates of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in the world.MethodsHigh-throughput Masscode mass spectrometry genotyping was done on genomic DNA from 574 individuals (394 cases and 180 age-frequency matched controls). SNPs were chosen from among genes involving DNA repair enzymes, and Phase I and Phase II enzymes.We developed a novel adaptation of the Decision Forest pattern recognition method named Decision Forest for SNPs (DF-SNPs). The method was designated to analyze the SNP data.ResultsThe classifier in separating the cases from the controls developed with DF-SNPs gave concordance, sensitivity and specificity, of 94.7%, 99.0% and 85.1%, respectively; suggesting its usefulness for hypothesizing what SNPs or combinations of SNPs could be involved in susceptibility to esophageal cancer. Importantly, the DF-SNPs algorithm incorporated a randomization test for assessing the relevance (or importance) of individual SNPs, SNP types (Homozygous common, heterozygous and homozygous variant) and patterns of SNP types (SNP patterns) that differentiate cases from controls. For example, we found that the different genotypes of SNP GADD45B E1122 are all associated with cancer risk.ConclusionThe DF-SNPs method can be used to differentiate esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cases from controls based on individual SNPs, SNP types and SNP patterns.

In cases where high correlations exist within the data, it may be beneficial to capture these dependencies through latent variables, for an enhanced use of the random forest framework. In this paper, we present Sylva, the second proposal of a random forest with latent variables after T-Trees, derived from the seminal works of Botta and co-workers (Botta et al., 2008). Sylva is an innovative hybrid approach in which the dynamic generation of latent variables used to learn the random forest is driven by an additional forest model, this time a forest of latent tree models. The latter forest model, a class of Bayesian networks devised in (Mourad et al., 2011), allows a flexible modeling of the dependencies existing within the data. In the comprehensive study reported here, three variants of Sylva, instantiated by different clustering methods (CAST, DBSCAN, Louvain method), are compared to T-Trees using high-dimensional real-world datasets (161 datasets each describing around 5,000 observations and between 5,700 and 39,000 variables) in the context of genetic association studies. We show that T-Trees and Sylva have comparable high predictive powers (aeras under the ROC curves), that lie in range [0.887, 0.961] (T-Trees), and in interval [0.885, 0.979] (over the three Sylva instantiations). Interestingly, T-Trees and Sylva are shown to differ significantly in their importance measure distributions: in Sylva, the importance measure distribution corresponding to top ranked variables is significantly skewed towards higher values than in T-Trees, which meets the feature selection enhancement objective. This property holds true for the three instantiations of Sylva. In addition, the thorough analysis of the number of top-ranked variables jointly identified by T-Trees and Sylva highlights the possibility to cross-validate the findings, in order to constitute a priorized list of features (e.g., to be further analyzed by biologists, in the context of genetic association studies). Finally, we conclude that it is recommended to use CAST or DBSCAN, and not the Louvain method, on the 161 datasets analyzed, to increase the probability of Sylva to detect top variables missedby T-Trees among its top ranked variables.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/DSAA.2018.00032", "venue": "2018 IEEE 5th International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA)", "journal": "2018 IEEE 5th International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2913566187", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["23449", "89141", "207738357", "155181680", "11259771", "8397120", "30500829", "12416799", "36950383", "14382796", "36484306", "11407469", "60993494", "16947789", "41174114", "14779496", "11070886", "9619343", "9976187", "123722079", "15137276", "88520060", "1908435", "355163", "334423", "7161110", "12206069", "9293695", "61987452", "14168219", "4310988", "9874711", "61972357", "19011676"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59600482"}

They are typically unconditioned generative models which has no control on modes of the graphs being generated. Differently, in this paper, we are interested in a new problem named \\emph{Deep Graph Translation}: given an input graph, we want to infer a target graph based on their underlying (both global and local) translation mapping. Graph translation could be highly desirable in many applications such as disaster management and rare event forecasting, where the rare and abnormal graph patterns (e.g., traffic congestions and terrorism events) will be inferred prior to their occurrence even without historical data on the abnormal patterns for this graph (e.g., a road network or human contact network). To achieve this, we propose a novel Graph-Translation-Generative Adversarial Networks (GT-GAN) which will generate a graph translator from input to target graphs. GT-GAN consists of a graph translator where we propose new graph convolution and deconvolution layers to learn the global and local translation mapping. A new conditional graph discriminator has also been proposed to classify target graphs by conditioning on input graphs.

This paper discusses a hybrid NLP system, called AutoMCExtractor, to collect medical conditions (including disease/disorder and sign/symptom) from drug labels published by the FDA. Altogether, 6,611 medical conditions in a manually-annotated gold standard were used for the system evaluation. The pre-processing step extracted the plain text from XML file and detected eight related LOINC sections (e.g. Adverse Reactions, Warnings and Precautions) for medical condition extraction. Conditional Random Fields (CRF) classifiers, trained on token, linguistic, and semantic features, were then used for medical condition extraction. Lastly, dictionary-based post-processing corrected boundary-detection errors of the CRF step. We evaluated the AutoMCExtractor on manually-annotated FDA drug labels and report the results on both token and span levels. Precision, recall, and F-measure were 0.90, 0.81, and 0.85, respectively, for the span level exact match; for the token-level evaluation, precision, recall, and F-measure were 0.92, 0.73, and 0.82, respectively.

We use multitask learning for joint morphological modeling for the features within two dialects, and as a knowledge-transfer scheme for cross-dialectal modeling. We use adversarial training to learn dialect invariant features that can help the knowledge-transfer scheme from the high to low-resource variants. We work with two dialectal variants: Modern Standard Arabic (high-resource \"dialect\") and Egyptian Arabic (low-resource dialect) as a case study.

This paper focuses on our investigation of automatic interpretation of side scan sonar data for the purpose of detecting and classifying undersea mines. The test data set is a series of side scan sonar images taken from a U. S. Navy acoustic sensor under optimal conditions (flat, sandy bottom). Groundtruth is available for acoustic images with eight unique types of mine targets. The interpretation of the data is per formed in two stages. The first stage, preprocessing and target detection, uses an adaptive thresholding algorithm coupled with an adaptive averaging technique to locate objects of interest in the sonar image. The second stage, classification, performs a binary classification of whether each detected object is, or is not, a mine. The classification is achieved using an attribute-based decision tree. An approach for a third stage, identification of the mark and mod of the classified bottom mines, is also presented. The results to date, as well as plans for the future, are discussed.", "year": 1989, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/UUST.1989.754734", "venue": "Proceedings of the 6th International Symposium on Unmanned Untethered Submersible Technology,", "journal": "Proceedings of the 6th International Symposium on Unmanned Untethered Submersible Technology,", "mag_id": "1839170276", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["523258", "126595556", "214697696", "5360035", "23800277", "22218276", "10512015", "62602176", "125998007", "901649", "56533332", "37181873"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:108427228"}

This can help businesses to increase their productivity, lower cost and effectiveness, increase scalability and improve relationship with business partners and attract customers. Communication in wireless network is critical and challenging issue. Wireless spoofing attacks are occurs easily and reduce the networks performance. Wireless spoofing attacks are easy to launch and can significantly impact the performance of networks. The flexibility and openness of wireless networks enables an adversary to masquerade as other devices easily. The traditional approach to detect spoofing attacks is to apply cryptographic authentication. Here using spatial information, a physical property of each node, so hard to falsify and not depend on cryptographic security, on the beginning for (1) detecting spoofing attacks; (2) determining the number of attackers when multiple node pretend as a same node identity, and (3) localizing multiple adversaries. Here using the correlation between a signal's spatial direction and the average received signal gain of received signal strength (RSS) inherited from wireless nodes to detect the spoofing attacks. Then the problem of determining the number of attackers as multiclass detection problem is formulated. Cluster-based mechanisms are developed to determine the number of attackers. When the training data is available, Support Vector Machines (SVM) method is used to further improve the accuracy of determining the number of attackers. The approach can both detects the presence of attacks as well as determine the number of adversaries, spoofing the same node identity, also that can localize any number of attackers and eliminate them.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2508148458", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:113740988"}

However, the analysis of such a huge amount of expression levels is quite a hopeless task for a human investigation if proper automatic intelligent tools are not available. Due to their ability of treating complex multivariate problems, machine learning techniques, such as Hierarchical Clustering (HC), Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), Neural Networks (NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Decision Trees (DT), have been successfully adopted in extracting the knowledge contained in a set of n tissues, for each of which the value of the expression level of m genes has been obtained through a DNA microarray. For example, the n different tissues could have been extracted from the same patient at different time instants to analyze the effect of a given drug. Or, in another situation, the tissues refer to n different patients, some of which are affected by a given pathology. Without entering into the important problems concerning the normalization and the thresholding of raw data produced by a typical scanner, the input of the machine learning technique can be viewed as a real matrix G containing m rows (one for each gene) and n columns (one for each tissue). Since in general the value of n lies around 100 (due to the high cost of a single experiment with DNA microarray) whereas m is often greater than ten thousands, the matrix G is strongly rectangular and this affects the application of any automatic method.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2473554606", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["52881226", "32693367", "16935654", "18956685", "18401048", "38398602", "53974389", "15350774", "369311", "4835715"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:113746108"}

This thesis demonstrates the effectiveness of spectral textile detectors on both real and simulated hyperspectral remotely sensed data. Feature selection methods determine sets of wavebands relevant to spectral textile detection. Classifiers are trained on hyperspectral contact data with the selected wavebands, and classifier parameters are optimized to improve performance on a training set. Classifiers with optimized parameters are used to classify contact data with artificially added noise and remotely-sensed hyperspectral data. The performance of optimized classifiers on hyperspectral data is measured with Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.

The advantage is a less constrained model that more robustly adapts to noisy observations while still providing structured motion information, as required by several applications. The cage is parameterized with a set of 3D features dedicated to the description of human morphology. This allows to formalize a novel representation of 3D meshed and articulated characters, the Oriented Quads Rigging (OQR). To regularize the tracking, the OQR space is subsequently constrained to plausible poses using manifold learning.

The subjects comprised 35 right-hand dominant (speech center located in the left hemisphere) and 32 left-hand dominant individuals (speech center located in the right hemisphere).

Monroe (monroe@usc.edu) Department of Psychology, University of Southern California Los Angeles, CA 90089-1061 Abstract interesting for small amounts of money, compared to receiving a large amount (Festinger & Carlsmith, 1959). Several authors (e.g., Read & Miller, 1994; Read, Vanman, & Miller, 1997; Shultz & Lepper, 1996; Simon & Holyoak, 2002) have argued that cognitive dissonance (Festinger, 1957) and related consistency phenomena (Abelson et al., 1968) can be modeled as a parallel constraint satisfaction process in a neural network, where the relevant cognitions are treated as nodes in the network and the consistent and inconsistent relations between cognitions are treated as excitatory and inhibitory relationships, respectively. Read, Vanman, and Miller (1997) have noted that parallel constraint satisfaction processes provide a computational implementation of the Gestalt processes that provide the theoretical underpinnings of dissonance theory. These authors, and particularly Shultz and Lepper (1996) have shown that a number of different Cognitive Dissonance findings can be successfully modeled in a parallel constraint satisfaction network. However, recently Van Overwalle and Jordens (2002) have noted that these approaches to modeling cognitive dissonance can only model the immediate attitude and belief change in the specific experimental situation, but that they are incapable of modeling any long-term attitude or belief change that might result from resolving the dissonance. They rightly note that this is due to the lack of any kind of learning mechanism in the proposed models. All of these models use recurrent or feedback neural networks in which attitude and belief change is captured by changes in the activation of relevant nodes representing the key cognitions. However, none of these models have a learning mechanism that can modify the associations or links between cognitions as a result of the changes in pattern of activations. Such weight change would allow for the representation of long- term attitude change. To attempt to remedy this lack, Van Overwalle and Jordens (2002) proposed a feedforward neural network model, with delta rule learning, that would change the links among cognitions in response to changes in the pattern of activations of the nodes. They argued that this model could successfully capture the long-term attitude change that would result from cognitive dissonance processes. This paper presents a recurrent neural network model of long term attitude change resulting from the reduction of cognitive dissonance. The model uses Contrastive Hebbian Learning (CHL) to capture changes in weight strength among cognitions resulting from dissonance reduction. Several authors have presented recurrent network models of dissonance reduction that capture the constraint satisfaction nature of dissonance. But as these models did not learn they could only model short-term attitude change represented by changes in activatio. In response, Van Overwalle and Jordens (2002) presented a feedforward model, with delta rule learning, in an attempt to capture long-term attitude change caused by dissonance reduction. However, the feedforward nature of their model created two problems. First, it could not capture the parallel constraint satisfaction mechanisms that underlie dissonance reduction. Second, and perhaps more important, the network was not able to \u201creason\u201d backwards from its inconsistent behavior to its new attitude, but instead had to be explicitly taught its new attitude. The present model overcomes the weaknesses of the previous approaches to modeling dissonance reduction. Because it has learning it can represent long-term attitude change by weight change and because it is a recurrent model it can propagate changes from inconsistent behavior to the attitudes linked to that behavior. Keywords: Coherence, Cognitive Consistency, Constraint Satisfaction, Neural networks, Connectionist models. Introduction One of the most famous and productive theories in social psychology has been Festinger\u2019s (1957) theory of Cognitive Dissonance. The term cognitive dissonance has entered everyday language and is often used to describe inconsistencies among cognitions. According to Cognitive Dissonance Theory, when two cognitions are dissonant with each other, an individual is motivated to reduce that dissonance. Festinger defined two cognitions as being in a dissonant relationship if the obverse of one cognition followed from the other. To date, researchers have used dissonance theory to generate a number of counter intuitive findings, such as finding that people like groups better the more painful is the initiation to join that group (Gerard & Mathewson, 1966) and finding that people like a boring task better if they agree to tell someone that the task is actually", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2767517619", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["142509275"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:149080389"}

Although SVMs are often used as an off-the-shelf tool, there are still some important issues which require improvement, such as feature rescaling.

This paper describes two feature rescaling methods: multiple kernel learning-based rescaling (MKL-SVM) and kernel-target alignment-based rescaling (KTA-SVM).

The investigations are part of the development of a laser-based remote sensor (laser fluorosensor) to be used for the detection and classification of oil spills on water surfaces. The polychromator of the fluorosensor has six channels for measuring signals that represent the spectral fluorescence signature of the detected oil in the UV/VIS wavelength range following excitation at 355 nm wavelength. The investigation of the oil classification is based on the shape of the signature of the oil detected by these channels. The investigation uses three methods to examine crude oils, heavy refined oils, and sludge oils: the channels\u2019 relationships method (CRM); artificial neural networks (ANNs); and support vector machines (SVMs). This was done on a laboratory database of oil fluorescence spectra. The database and the input fluorescence signature of the oils play a very important role in the efficiency of the classification method. If the input fluorescence of the oil does not fit into one of the classes already included in the database or if it is a completely new and previously not considered signature, then the training process for classification must always be redone. Generally, all three methods yield promising results and can be used for the detection and classification of oil spills on water surfaces. The channels\u2019 relationship method provides a meaningful classification of the available spectra, according to a rough oil type estimation. More specific substance information can be achieved with ANNs and SVMs. Both SVMs and ANNs prove to be efficient, fast, and reliable and have real-time capabilities. The SVM method is faster and more stable than ANN.

The proposed QC-SPHARM can distinguish between normal control (NC) subjects and AD patients, as well as between amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients having high possibility progressing into AD and those who do not. Using the spherical harmonics (SPHARM) based registration, hippocampal surfaces segmented from the ADNI data are individually registered to a template surface constructed from the NC subjects using SPHARM. Local geometric distortions of the deformation from the template surface to each subject are quantified in terms of conformality distortions and curvatures distortions. The measurements are combined with the spherical harmonics coefficients and the total volume change of the subject from the template. Afterwards, a t-test based feature selection method incorporating the bagging strategy is applied to extract those local regions having high discriminating power of the two classes. The disease diagnosis machine can therefore be built using the data under the Support Vector Machine (SVM) setting. Using 110 NC subjects and 110 AD patients from the ADNI database, the proposed algorithm achieves 85:2% testing accuracy on 80 random samples as testing subjects, with the incorporation of surface geometry in the classification machine.

The objective of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we investigate the effects of large scale and imbalance on SVMs. We highlight the role of linear non-separability in this problem. Secondly, we develop a both practical and theoretical guaranteed meta-algorithm to handle the trouble of scale and imbalance. The approach is named Support Cluster Machines (SCMs). It incorporates the informative and the representative under-sampling mechanisms to speedup the training procedure. The SCMs differs from the previous similar ideas in two ways, (a) the theoretical foundation has been provided, and (b) the clustering is performed in the feature space rather than in the input space. The theoretical analysis not only provides justification, but also guides the technical choices of the proposed approach. Finally, experiments on both the synthetic and the TRECVID data are carried out.

We determined CSF levels of several cancer-associated microRNAs for 118 patients diagnosed with different types of brain cancers and nonneoplastic neuropathologies by quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis. The levels of miR-10b and miR-21 are found significantly increased in the CSF of patients with glioblastoma and brain metastasis of breast and lung cancer, compared with tumors in remission and a variety of nonneoplastic conditions. Members of the miR-200 family are highly elevated in the CSF of patients with brain metastases but not with any other pathologic conditions, allowing discrimination between glioblastoma and metastatic brain tumors. Quantification of as few as 7 microRNAs in CSF enables differential recognition of glioblastoma and metastatic brain cancer using computational machine learning tools (Support Vector Machine) with high accuracy (91%-99%) on a test set of samples. Furthermore, we show that disease activity and treatment response can be monitored by longitudinal microRNA profiles in the CSF of glioblastoma and non-small cell lung carcinoma patients.

Such a problem can be addressed through a regularization framework where the regularizer induces a joint-sparsity pattern between task decision functions. We follow this principled framework and focus on lp-lq (with 0 \u2264 p \u2264 1 and 1 \u2264 q \u2264 2) mixed norms as sparsity-inducing penalties. Our motivation for addressing such a larger class of penalty is to adapt the penalty to a problem at hand leading thus to better performances and better sparsity pattern. For solving the problem in the general multiple kernel case, we first derive a variational formulation of the l1-lq penalty which helps us in proposing an alternate optimization algorithm. Although very simple, the latter algorithm provably converges to the global minimum of the l1-lq penalized problem. For the linear case, we extend existing works considering accelerated proximal gradient to this penalty. Our contribution in this context is to provide an efficient scheme for computing the l1-lq proximal operator. Then, for the more general case, when 0 <; p <; 1, we solve the resulting nonconvex problem through a majorization-minimization approach. The resulting algorithm is an iterative scheme which, at each iteration, solves a weighted l1-lq sparse MTL problem.

This study used a small volume, fish embryo system to reveal potential mechanisms of action and diagnostic exposure patterns for TBPH (bis (2-ethylhexyl)-tetrabromophthalate), a component of several widely-used commercial products. Two different concentration of TBPH were applied to sensitive early life stages of an ecologically important test species, Fundulus heteroclitus (Atlantic killifish), with a well-annotated genome. Exposed fish embryos were sampled for transcriptomics or chemical analysis of parent compound and primary metabolite or observed for development and survival through larval stage. Global transcript profiling using RNA-seq was conducted (n = 16 per treatment) to provide a non-targeted and statistically robust approach to characterize TBPH gene expression patterns. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a dose-response in the expression of genes associated with a surprisingly limited number of biological pathways, but included the aryl hydrocarbon receptor signal transduction pathway, which is known to respond to several toxicologically-important chemical classes. A transcriptional fingerprint using Random Forests was developed that was able to perfectly discriminate exposed vs. non-exposed individuals in test sets. These results suggest that TBPH has a relatively low potential for developmental toxicity (at least in fishes), despite concerns related to its structural similarities to endocrine disrupting chemicals and that the early life stage Fundulus system may provide a convenient test system for exposure characterization. More broadly, this study advances the usefulness of a biological testing and analysis system utilizing non-targeted transcriptomics profiling and early developmental endpoints that complements current screening methods to characterize chemicals of ecological and human health concern.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30721860", "doi": "10.1016/j.envpol.2019.01.010", "venue": "Environmental pollution", "journal": "Environmental pollution", "mag_id": "2909069038", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:73434003"}

While most state-of-the-art iris recognition algorithms are focused on preprocessing iris images, important new directions have been identified recently in iris biometrics research. These include optimal feature selection and iris pattern classification. In this paper, we propose an iris recognition scheme based on Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and asymmetrical Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Instead of using the whole iris region, we elicit the iris information between the collarette and the pupillary boundaries to suppress effects of eyelids and eyelashes occlusions, and pupil dilation, and to minimize the matching error. To select the optimal feature subset together with increasing the overall recognition accuracy, we apply GAs with a new fitness function. The traditional SVMs are modified into asymmetrical SVMs to handle: (1) highly unbalanced sample proportion between two classes, and 2) different types of misclassification error that lead to different misclassification losses. Furthermore, the parameters of SVMs are optimized in order to improve the generalization performance.

Due to the increasing use of images in various fields, it is essential to protect the confidential image data from unauthorized access. Biometric identification is an actively growing area of research and is widely used in application fields like E-commerce, E-banking, E-passports, E-licences and security applications. In recent years, Face recognition becomes one of the popular biometric identification systems used in identifying or verifying individuals and matching it against library of known faces. Also it finds its application in wide variety of areas like criminal identification, human - computer interaction, security systems, credit- card verification, teleconference, image and film processing. This paper suggests a secure encryption of medical images along with an automated face recognition system based on extracting the features from the input face image. For encryption process, RSA algorithm is used.

Recent literature has focused on complex neural networks and deep learning models for solving STLF. While these models work well for load forecasting with complex non-linear relationships, they have been shown to be less effective than simpler univariate models for STLF problems with under a 6 hours horizon. Given the lack of multivariate data (such as temperature) in many practical datasets, we need better univariate prediction models for STLF. By partitioning the dataset by temporal features, we develop a novel ensemble learning method that exploits daily seasonality in electricity consumption data to improve accuracy of popular univariate models. We train an ensemble of models from the dataset partitions. We develop a variety of methods, including Ridge Regression, to increase the robustness of the ensemble prediction. To show the effectiveness of our approach, we perform detailed evaluation using an aggregated user electricity consumption dataset collected by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP). We select four popular prediction algorithms in literature for our experiments, including Kernel Regression (KR), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and neural network approaches. We compare the performance of these algorithms applying our ensemble approach to training only one single model. Our approach leads to an 11.2% decrease in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and 21.3% decrease in root mean squared error (RMSE) over the single model approach for KR, and a 30% and 32.4% decrease in MAPE and RMSE respectively for SVR.

State-of-the-art analogues of skip-gram model in graphs define a notion of neighbourhood and aim to find the vector representation for a node, which maximizes the likelihood of preserving this neighborhood. In this paper, we take a drastic departure from the existing notion of neighbourhood of a node by utilizing the idea of coreness. More specifically, we utilize the well-established idea that nodes with similar core numbers play equivalent roles in the network and hence induce a novel and an organic notion of neighbourhood. Based on this idea, we propose core2vec, a new algorithmic framework for learning low dimensional continuous feature mapping for a node. Consequently, the nodes having similar core numbers are relatively closer in the vector space that we learn. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of core2vec by comparing word similarity scores obtained by our method where the node representations are drawn from standard word association graphs 11In linguistics, such networks built from various linguistic units are known to have a core-periphery structure (see [3] and the references therein), against scores computed by other state-of-the-art network representation techniques like node2vec, Deep-Walk and LINE. Our results always outperform these existing methods, in some cases achieving improvements as high as 46 % on certain ground-truth word similarity datasets.

The prime challenging aspect of sentiment analysis is the presence of sarcasm in message. Sarcasm is one kind of sentiment that is expressed verbally through the use of rolling of eyes and tonal stress. It consist of words mean the opposite of what user want to convey in order to be funny, or to show some irritation. The active online users and their reviews on websites are large in number so it is hard to detect even for humans, so in order to achieve error-free sentiment analysis it is imperative for machines to detect it accurately. The paper proposes the use of three different classes of features to help computers identify sarcasm reasonably well. In this paper, we intend to implement and empirically analyze number of computing techniques like Support Vector Machine, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors and Neural Networks for sarcasm detection on social media. The experimentation was done using three datasets i.e. SemEval 2015 Twitter benchmark dataset; random tweets collected using the Streaming API and a publicly available dataset of Reddit posts. The datasets provide interesting insights into how different forms of social media use the tool of sarcasm differently. The evaluated results were based on the performance measures like precision, recall, accuracy and F score. Amongst all, Twitter datasets had achieved the highest accuracy of around 91% to 92%, while the Reddit dataset had obtained peak accuracy of 80%.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-30577-2_61", "venue": "Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering", "journal": "Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering", "mag_id": "2975297849", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204082140"}

We use the term predictive sentiment analysis to denote the approach in which sen- timent analysis is used to predict the changes in the phenomenon of interest. In this paper, positive sentiment probability is proposed as a new indicator to be used in predictive sentiment analysis in finance. By using the Granger causality test we show that sentiment polarity (positive and negative sentiment) can indi- cate stock price movements a few days in advance. Finally, we adapted the Support Vector Machine classification mechanism to categorize tweets into three sentiment categories (positive, negative and neutral), resulting in im- proved predictive power of the classifier in the stock market application.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2535970291", "mag_field_of_study": ["Economics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:157433366"}
