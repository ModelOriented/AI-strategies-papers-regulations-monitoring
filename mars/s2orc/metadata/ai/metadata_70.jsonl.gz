While previous work employed a Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF) to perform deformation tolerant matching of periocular images, we show that the approach is not well-suited for facial images, which can contain significantly larger and more complex deformations across the image. Like the GMRF, the GCRF tries to find the maximum scoring assignment between a match pair in the presence of non-stationary deformations. However, unlike the GMRF, the GCRF directly computes the posterior probability that the observed deformation is consistent with the distortions exhibited in other authentic match pairs. The difference is the inclusion of a derived mapping between an input comparison and output deformation score. We evaluate performance on the CMU Multi-PIE facial dataset across all sessions and expressions, finding that the GCRF is significantly more effective at capturing naturally occurring large deformations than the previous GMRF approach.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CVPRW.2016.26", "venue": "2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)", "journal": "2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2471920278", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16272873", "6246582", "8598777", "13045471", "17576364", "11609948", "16068407", "7004602", "16450594", "208935309", "6339189", "122308290", "7827370", "277918", "2412689", "7533396", "327932", "1267739", "6879107", "1838914", "124539318", "17221751", "9085404", "16002878", "5969162", "1210309", "61652025", "1616901", "9443613", "13239636", "12331515", "44583807", "14134075"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18986807"}

Burn scar is an important parameter when modelling the impact of wildfires on the ecosystem and the climatic system. We have developed an automatic burn scar mapping method using daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, in which the Global Environment Monitoring Index (GEMI), a vegetation index VI3T and a new index, GEMI-Burn scar (GEMI-B), were used together to enhance the differences between burned and unburned pixels related to vegetation photosynthesis, surface temperature and vegetation water content, respectively, and an automatic region growing method based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) was used to classify burn scars without any predefined threshold. A case study was carried out to validate the new method at the border area between Mongolia and China, where a wildfire took place in May 2003. The results show that the burn scar area extracted by the new method is consistent with that from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data with high accuracy. The sound performance of the new technique is due to the following reasons: (1) multiple features of burn scar spectra were combined and used, (2) a reasonable assumption was made stating that the neighbourhoods of active fires (hotspots) are most likely to be burn scars, (3) an SVM classifier was adopted that works well with a small number of training samples, and (4) an iterative classification procedure was developed that is capable of running continuous training for the SVM classifier to deal with the transitionary features of burn scar pixels.

Using shape descriptors based on contour, moments and orientations, and also texture ones, the wear regions of the cutting inserts were characterised and using different classifiers the wear was modelled. The proposed models were evaluated on classic shape datasets as well as in new insert datasets created specifically for this problem. The motivation behind our work was that optimizing tool replacement operations may produce a significant improvement in manufacturing efficiency and competitiveness. It is known that changing tools at the right moment is essential,not only because of the cost of cutting tools themselves, but also for the indirect costs due to the unproductive time needed to carry out the tool replacement. This thesis addresses the task of tool wear monitoring in edge profile milling processes using computer vision and machine learning techniques allowing to replace the tools at the optimum moment and thus saving direct and indirect costs. We have created three insert datasets to assess our solutions in similar conditions to the real environment: Insert edges dataset, Insert region dataset, and Insert High-Resolution Dataset. The general shape can be extract from the boundary pixels of an image. For this reason, our first proposal for shape description was a contour-based approach. We proposed RCPDH and CPDH36R, both based on CPDH (Contour points distribution histogram). Next, we decided to describe the images using both moments and orientations. We introduced two new methods named aZIBO and B-ORCHIZ, both of them based on ZMEG approach. They are composed for global and local shape descriptors. The combination of local and global descriptors allows us to have an idea of the general form and to access the local details of the form. In this way, we take advantage of both methods of description. B-ORCHIZ proved to be the best moment-orientation descriptor obtaining an accuracy up to 91.92% in the shape description problem. Results were promising not only for generic shape datasets but also in real applications obtaining results up to 87.02% in terms of accuracy in the tool wear monitoring problem. As B-ORCHIZ descriptor proved to be useful in the tool wear monitoring field, we explored the combination of it with our shape descriptor proposal, ShapeFeat. ShapeFeat takes into account ten different features extracted from the binary region of each image. Combining ShapeFeat with B-ORCHIZ and evaluating three types of fusion methods, we obtained results which improves the performance significantly, yielding a 91.44% of hit rate in the complete dataset evaluation using two classes and a 82.90% using three classes. Our final proposal consisted of a new online, low cost and fast approach to determine the state and categorize the wear of cutting tools used in edge profile milling processes. The method proposed is based on dividing the region of the cutting edge in patches. We presented five alternatives to carry out this division and we described each patch with different texture methods. The experiments were carried out using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with intersection kernel. Results shown that our proposal \u201dSmall Edge Division\u201d (SED) outperforms the other region division proposals achieving an Fscore value of 0.9032.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2767254328", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:191621265"}

The current face liveness detection approaches utilize either static or dynamic features, but not both. In fact, the dynamic and static features have different advantages in face liveness detection. In this paper, we propose a scheme combining dynamic and static features to capture merits of them for face liveness detection. First, the dynamic maps are captured from the inter-frame motion in the video, which investigates motion information of the face in the video. Then, with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the dynamic and static features are extracted from the dynamic maps and the frame images, respectively. Next, in CNN, the fully connected layers containing the dynamic and static features are concatenated to form a fused feature. Finally, the fused features are used to train a binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, which classifies the frames into two categories, i.e. frame with real or fake face...", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1142/S0219691318400015", "venue": "IJWMIP", "journal": "IJWMIP", "mag_id": "2781785503", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["204229122", "201833752"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4946245"}

Our algorithmic architecture, called SGIM-D, allows efficient learning of high-dimensional continuous sensorimotor inverse models in robots, and in particular learns distributions of parameterised motor policies that solve a corresponding distribution of parameterised goals/tasks. This is made possible by the technical integration of imitation learning techniques within an algorithm for learning inverse models that relies on active goal babbling. After reviewing social learning and intrinsic motivation approaches to action learning, we describe the general framework of our algorithm, before detailing its architecture. In an experiment where a robot arm has to learn to use a flexible fishing line, we illustrate that SGIM-D efficiently combines the advantages of social learning and intrinsic motivation and benefits from human demonstration properties to learn how to produce varied outcomes in the environment, while developing more precise control policies in large spaces.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1804.07269", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10514-013-9339-y", "venue": "Autonomous Robots, Springer Verlag, 2014, 36 (3), pp.273-294", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2032077341", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["207155342", "16864200", "2718420", "1045325", "10280532", "20261086", "6042628", "6042628", "687961", "8918051", "12893811", "11880118", "40786802", "5679082", "12010272", "7498454", "43766241", "119805219", "10241552", "2419403", "2032391", "61986270", "10837930", "22748095", "14997956", "8111848", "238001", "14665418", "6933296", "15093313", "15454626", "14949756", "15148826", "17874844", "234198", "9098305", "9053126", "9140802", "108483799", "18546010", "41109184", "16004968", "14961077", "2260163"], "inbound_citations": ["47042723", "49863044", "215135453", "49571325", "54931355", "17791461", "39691934", "831517", "37341699", "89617541", "49429853", "3718509", "3703428", "3531724", "14809448", "29658409", "16609831", "3552662", "145051294", "49569263", "7406990", "53696244", "46984562", "14676037"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4948958"}

For each spike initiator we use the classic two time constant model, with independent noise added to the input. For each filter the operator provides an FIR (or truncated IIR) function; and for all spike initiators the operator specifies a single resting threshold level, one time constant of excitation, one of accommodation, and a mean random spike rate. The use of FIR filters allows us the flexibility to experiment with different types of filters, including those derived from in vivo experiments. The use of noisy spike initiators provides some biological realism, including the ability of the cochlea to give massively synchronous responses to temporal events.

Hence, some researchers have developed complex procedures to produce accurate forecast while considering significant features and optimum parameters. Therefore, a multistage optimization for hybrid Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) model is developed in this study to provide an accurate price forecast with optimized parameters and input features.

Our model is conditioned on the object images from their marginal distributions to generate a realistic image from their joint distribution by explicitly learning the possible interactions. We evaluate our model through qualitative experiments and user evaluations in both the scenarios when either paired or unpaired examples for the individual object images and the joint scenes are given during training. Our results reveal that the learned model captures potential interactions between the two object domains given as input to output new instances of composed scene at test time in a reasonable fashion.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1807.07560", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2885221386", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["4117071", "3613245", "31339674", "6561482", "2554264", "5002792", "1282515", "5216145", "10894094", "5808102", "6200260", "6099034", "4593810", "3568073", "1543021", "211227", "3692201", "3783306", "10627900", "459456", "12803511", "1099052", "2202933", "11758569", "1563370", "1515901", "2621730", "1687220", "14124313", "16985983", "1033001", "41805341", "14568616", "206595891", "1840346", "1277217", "50698", "6002134", "2842850", "206770979"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49876117"}

However, it is a challenging task primarily due to the abnormal and varying appearance of patients' teeth. The emerging utilization of intraoral scanners (IOSs) in clinics further increases the difficulty in automated tooth labeling, as the raw surfaces acquired by IOS are typically low-quality at gingival and deep intraoral regions. In recent years, some pioneering end-to-end methods (e.g., PointNet) have been proposed in the communities of computer vision and graphics to consume directly raw surface for 3D shape segmentation. Although these methods are potentially applicable to our task, most of them fail to capture fine-grained local geometric context that is critical to the identification of small teeth with varying shapes and appearances. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep-learning method, called MeshSegNet, for automated tooth labeling on raw dental surfaces. Using multiple raw surface attributes as inputs, MeshSegNet integrates a series of graph-constrained learning modules along its forward path to hierarchically extract multi-scale local contextual features. Then, a dense fusion strategy is applied to combine local-to-global geometric features for the learning of higher-level features for mesh cell annotation. The predictions produced by our MeshSegNet are further post-processed by a graph-cut refinement step for final segmentation. We evaluated MeshSegNet using a real-patient dataset consisting of raw maxillary surfaces acquired by 3D IOS. Experimental results, performed 5-fold cross-validation, demonstrate that MeshSegNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning methods for 3D shape segmentation.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "32031933", "doi": "10.1109/TMI.2020.2971730", "venue": "IEEE transactions on medical imaging", "journal": "IEEE transactions on medical imaging", "mag_id": "3004849003", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211064819"}

The dialect identification challenging task becomes more complicated when dealing with an under-resourced dialects belonging to a same county/region. In this paper, we start by analyzing statistically Algerian dialects in order to capture their specificities related to prosody information which are extracted at utterance level after a coarse-grained consonant/vowel segmentation. According to these analysis findings, we propose a Hierarchical classification approach for spoken Arabic algerian Dialect IDentification (HADID). It takes advantage from the fact that dialects have an inherent property of naturally structured into hierarchy. Within HADID, a top-down hierarchical classification is applied, in which we use Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) method to build a local classifier for every parent node into the hierarchy dialect structure. Our framework is implemented and evaluated on Algerian Arabic dialects corpus. Whereas, the hierarchy dialect structure is deduced from historic and linguistic knowledges. The results reveal that within {\\HD}, the best classifier is DNNs compared to Support Vector Machine. In addition, compared with a baseline Flat classification system, our HADID gives an improvement of 63.5% in term of precision. Furthermore, overall results evidence the suitability of our prosody-based HADID for speaker independent dialect identification while requiring less than 6s test utterances.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1703.10065", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2604763492", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2432347", "63766063", "8232419", "34800350", "150542535", "154354493", "2617020", "33919595", "2871920", "184459", "6290967", "11105920", "19282513", "5915161", "1275409", "18027665", "1327150", "38623317", "8032982", "4020110", "13968660", "131890464", "18641931", "163875886", "54566567", "3490317", "151652705", "12280341", "634693", "16950301", "1530131", "38320222", "15269416"], "inbound_citations": ["58673260", "203599779", "46961292", "52012926"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15691806"}

An efficient algorithm to compute the NTK, as well as its convolutional counterparts, appears in Arora et al. (2019a), which allowed studying performance of infinitely wide nets on datasets like CIFAR-10. However, super-quadratic running time of kernel methods makes them best suited for small-data tasks. We report results suggesting neural tangent kernels perform strongly on low-data tasks. 1. On a standard testbed of classification/regression tasks from the UCI database, NTK SVM beats the previous gold standard, Random Forests (RF), and also the corresponding finite nets. 2. On CIFAR-10 with 10 \u2013 640 training samples, Convolutional NTK consistently beats ResNet-34 by 1% - 3%. 3. On VOC07 testbed for few-shot image classification tasks on ImageNet with transfer learning (Goyal et al., 2019), replacing the linear SVM currently used with a Convolutional NTK SVM consistently improves performance. 4.

In this study, a total of 20 influential variables are taken into account including monthly electricity consumption, 14 weather variables, and 5 social variables. Based on support vector regression and fuzzy-rough feature selection with particle swarm optimization algorithms, the proposed method established a model with variables that relate to the forecast without ignoring some of these variables one may inevitably lead to forecasting errors. The proposed forecasting model was validated using historical data from South Korea. Its time period was from January 1991 to December 2012. The first 240 months were used for training and the remaining 24 for testing. The performance was evaluated using MAPE, MAE, RMSE, MBE, and UPA values. Furthermore, it was compared with that obtained from the artificial neural network, auto-regressive integrated moving average, multiple linear regression models, and the methods proposed in the previous studies, and found superior for every performance measure considered in this study. The proposed method has an advantage over the previous methods because it automatically determines appropriate and necessary variables for a reliable forecast. It is expected that the proposed model can contribute to more accurate forecasting of short-term electricity demand in residential sector. The ability to accurately forecast short-term electricity demand can assist power system operators and market participants in ensuring sustainable electricity planning decisions and secure electricity supply to the consumers.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.proeng.2015.08.459", "venue": null, "journal": "Procedia Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2210487714", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["158167687", "52148119", "115876127", "164360912", "26182175", "202095542", "7560559", "58670827", "189922189", "84832908", "15336196"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9834792"}

We demonstrated that DeepHiC is capable of reproducing high-resolution Hi-C data from as few as 1% downsampled reads.

In LS-SVM, the accuracy of the prediction is depends on the selection of kernel parameters. Unfortunately, there is no systematic methodology for selection of their optimal values. Therefore, a novel hybrid Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Programming \u2014 Least Squares Support Vector Machine (QIEP-SVM) is developed for accurate prediction. In QIEP-SVM, Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Programming (QIEP) is developed to optimise selected parameters for the LS-SVM which are gamma and sigma. QIEP is combining Evolutionary Programming (EP) with quantum mechanics concepts such as interference and superposition in order to enhance classical Evolutionary Programming (EP). The optimal output of DG is first generated using multiobjective Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Programming (QIEP) at various loading condition according to 24-hours load profile. The data from the simulations are then used as the inputs to the Least-Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM). There are three inputs which are active load (MW), reactive load (MVAR) and minimum voltage (p.u). Whereas, there are five outputs that represents the output of DG at five buses. The objective function for the optimisation process is to minimise the mean square error between predicted and targeted output. The performance of QIEP-SVM is then compared to classical LS-SVM using cross-validation technique and hybrid Artificial Neural Network-Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Programming (QIEP-ANN). The results of QIEP-SVM model had shown better prediction performance as compared to classical LS-SVM and QIEP-ANN.

One such example that attracts tremendous attention recently in machine learning is training Generative Adversarial Networks. We propose an algorithmic framework motivated by the inexact proximal point method, which solves the weakly monotone variational inequality corresponding to the original min-max problem by approximately solving a sequence of strongly monotone variational inequalities constructed by adding a strongly monotone mapping to the original gradient mapping. In this sequence, each strongly monotone variational inequality is defined with a proximal center that is updated using the approximate solution of the previous variational inequality. Our algorithm generates a sequence of solution that provably converges to a nearly stationary solution of the original min-max problem. The proposed framework is flexible because various subroutines can be employed for solving the strongly monotone variational inequalities. The overall computational complexities of our methods are established when the employed subroutines are subgradient method, stochastic subgradient method, gradient descent method and Nesterov's accelerated method and variance reduction methods for a Lipschitz continuous operator.

This paper proposes three random forest regression models (RFR) to predict water price in the western United States: a full variable set model and two reduced ones with optimal numbers of variables using a backward variable elimination (BVE) approach. Transactions of 12 semiarid states, from 1987 to 2009, and a dataset containing various predictors, were assembled. Multiple replications of k-fold cross-validation were applied to assess the model performance and their generalizability was tested on unused data. The importance of price influencing factors was then analyzed based on two plausible variable importance rankings. Results show that the RFR models have good predictive power for water price. They outperform a baseline model without leading to overfitting. Also, the higher degree of accuracy of the reduced models is insignificant, reflecting the robustness of RFR to including lower informative variables.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel metric learning approach to work directly on logarithms of SPD matrices. Specifically, our method aims to learn a tangent map that can directly transform the matrix logarithms from the original tangent space to a new tangent space of more discriminability.

The model is then selected by performing a gradient descent of the F\u03b2 loss function over the set of hyperparameters. Experiments on artificial and real-life data show the benefits of this method when the F\u03b2 score is considered. I. INTRODUCTION Support Vector Machines (SVM) introduced by Vapnik (18) have been widely used in the field of pattern recognition for the last decade. The popularity of the method relies on its strong theoretical foundations as well as on its practical results. Performance of classifiers is usually assessed by means of classification error rate or by Information Retrieval (IR) measures such as precision, recall, F\u03b2 , breakeven-point and ROC curves. Unfortunately, there is no direct connection between these IR criteria and the SVM hyperparameters: the regularization constant C and the kernel parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel method allowing the user to specify his requirement in terms of the F\u03b2 criterion. First of all, the F\u03b2 measure is reviewed as a user specification criterion in section II. A new SVM parametrization dealing with the \u03b2 parameter is introduced in section III. Afterwards, a procedure for automatic model selection according to F\u03b2 is proposed in section IV. This procedure is a gradient-based technique derived from the results of Chapelle, Vapnik et al. (4). Finally, experiments with artifical and real-life data are presented in section V. The two previous measures can be combined in a unique F\u03b2 measure in which the paramater \u03b2 specifies the relative importance of recall with respect to precision. Setting \u03b2 equals to 0 would only consider precision whereas taking \u03b2 = \u221e would only take recall into account. Moreover, precision and recall are of equal importance when using the F1 measure. The contingency matrix and estimations of precision, recall and F\u03b2 are given hereafter.

The effect of our loss supervision is to generate a more expanded feature space of compact classes where the overall level of the inter-identities\u2019 interference is reduced.

In the first stage, the input image and the conditional semantic guidance are fed into a cycled semantic-guided generation network to produce initial coarse results. In the second stage, we refine the initial results by using the proposed multi-scale spatial pooling \\& channel selection module and the multi-channel attention selection module. Moreover, uncertainty maps automatically learned from attention maps are used to guide the pixel loss for better network optimization. Exhaustive experiments on four challenging guided image-to-image translation tasks (face, hand, body and street view) demonstrate that our SelectionGAN is able to generate significantly better results than the state-of-the-art methods. Meanwhile, the proposed framework and modules are unified solutions and can be applied to solve other generation tasks, such as semantic image synthesis.

Oracle character recognition is important for modern archaeology, ancient text understanding, and historical chronology, etc. To overcome the limitation and class imbalance of training data in oracle character recognition, we propose a classification method based on deep metric learning. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to map the character images to an Euclidean space where the distance between different samples can measure their similarities such that classification can be performed by the Nearest Neighbor (NN) rule. Because new categories are still being discovered in reality, our model enables the rejection of unseen categories and the configuration of new categories. To accelerate NN classification, we also propose a prototype pruning method with little loss of accuracy. The proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the public dataset Oracle-20K and outperforms CNN with softmax layer on a new dataset Oracle-AYNU.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICDAR.2019.00057", "venue": "2019 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR)", "journal": "2019 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3003466563", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["33132413", "78363", "13710082", "125061137", "42272629", "13311218", "14201947", "207763512", "206597351", "7570553", "206592766", "24089567", "6844431", "6302074", "778934", "9433631", "5808102", "2239473", "206731103", "52874011", "6628106"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211026650"}

The effects of selectively targeting the predicted synthetic lethal genes is tested in silico using shRNA and drug screening data from cancer cell line databases. The clinical outcome in patients with mutation in primary gene and over/under-expression in the synthetic lethal gene is evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis.

For instance, the classification scores of the Bag of Features (BoF) model for image classification have been used to build a top-down categorization cost in a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model for semantic segmentation. Recent work shows that discriminative sparse dictionary learning (DSDL) can improve upon the unsupervised K-means dictionary learning method used in the BoF model due to the ability of DSDL to capture discriminative features from different classes. However, to the best of our knowledge, DSDL has not been used for building a top-down categorization cost for semantic segmentation. In this paper, we propose a CRF model that incorporates a DSDL based top-down cost for semantic segmentation. We show that the new CRF energy can be minimized using existing efficient discrete optimization techniques. Moreover, we propose a new method for jointly learning the CRF parameters, object classifiers and the visual dictionary. Our experiments demonstrate that by jointly learning these parameters, the feature representation becomes more discriminative and the segmentation performance improves with respect to that of state-of-the-art methods that use unsupervised K-means dictionary learning.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-10602-1_36", "venue": "ECCV", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "32681088", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["8773092", "90113", "13813737", "961425", "4246903", "6387937", "2117454", "9779450", "18382794", "14211670", "206590944", "53303132", "5574079", "33776056", "2068733", "277918", "3148797", "303727", "428083", "16462148", "14660874", "9952478", "242941", "978365", "1769943", "1458265", "8489515", "62424284", "62091811", "3014704", "10240161", "2908869"], "inbound_citations": ["2901004", "214624245", "69533278", "44404033", "16839249", "9185333", "22638233"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8647242"}

This complex translation process covers different phases, including instruction completion by adding obligatory information that is not explicitly given in human-oriented instructions. Robot action ontology is a common source of such additional information, and it is normally structured around a limited number of verbs, denoting robot specific action categories, each of them characterized by a certain action environment. Semi-manual action ontology building procedures are normally based on domain-specific human-language text mining, and one of the problems to be solved is the assignment of action categories for the obtained verbs. Verbs in English language are very polysemous, therefore action category, referring to different robot capabilities, can be determined only after comprehensive analysis of the verb\u2019s context. The task we solve is formulated as the text classification task, where action categories are treated as classes, and appropriate verb context \u2013 as classification instances. Since all classes are clearly defined, supervised machine learning paradigm is the best selection to tackle this problem. We experimentally investigated different context window widths; directions (context on the right, left, both sides of analyzed verb); and feature types (symbolic, lexical, morphological, aggregated). All statements were proved after exploration of two different datasets. The fact that all obtained results are above random and majority baselines allow us to claim that the proposed method can be used for predicting action categories. The best obtained results were achieved with Support Vector Machine method using window width of only 25 symbols on the right and bag-of-words as features. This exceeded random and majority baselines by more than 37% reaching 60% of accuracy.

We propose to train a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to regress lighting parameters from a single face image. Lacking massive ground truth lighting labels for face images in the wild, we use an existing method to estimate lighting parameters, which are treated as ground truth with noise. To alleviate the effect of such noise, we utilize the idea of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and propose a Label Denoising Adversarial Network (LDAN). LDAN makes use of synthetic data with accurate ground truth to help train a deep CNN for lighting regression on real face images.

Moreover, when learning clauses one by one, the induced clauses become less and less interesting as the algorithm is progressing to cover few remaining examples. In this paper, we propose a simulated annealing framework to overcome these problems. Using a refinement operator, we define neighborhood relations on clauses and on hypotheses (i.e. sets of clauses). With these relations and appropriate quality measures, we show how to induce clauses (in a coverage approach), or to induce hypotheses directly by using simulated annealing algorithms. We discuss the necessary conditions on the refinement operators and the evaluation measures to increase the effectiveness of the algorithm.

The manual interpretation of changes in brain volume based on visual examination by radiologist or a physician may lead to missing diagnosis when a large number of MRIs are analyzed. To avoid the human error, an automated intelligent classification system is proposed which caters the need for classification of brain MRI after identifying abnormal MRI volume, for the diagnosis of dementia. In this research work, advanced classification techniques using Support Vector Machines based on Particle Swarm Optimisation and Genetic algorithm are compared. Feature reduction by wavelets and PCA are analysed. From this analysis, it is observed that the proposed classification of SVM based PSO is found to be efficient than SVM trained with GA and wavelet based feature reduction technique yields better results than PCA.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5121/ijcseit.2011.1506", "venue": "International Journal of Computer Science, Engineering and Information Technology", "journal": "International Journal of Computer Science, Engineering and Information Technology", "mag_id": "2318078301", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61991848"}

According to Stuart Kauffman's view, (1) each cell type cycles through its own repeated pattern of gene expression, (2) the order of ontogeny is dependent on these cycles being short, and (3) evolution is possible because these cycles mutate gradually. This view of gene regulation reflects Kauffman's view that ontogeny is fundamentally the process of cells repeating cycles of activity. I criticize Kauffman's view of gene regulation networks and offer the connectionist theory of gene regulation as an alternative. On this view, the generic order of gene regulation mechanisms is due to the qualitatively consistent way that one gene product influences the expression of another. This allows networks to be stable and evolve to regulate accurately, allowing cells to react appropriately to their microenvironments, due to design by natural selection.IntroductionKauffman's Model of Gene RegulationExplaining the Order of Kauffman's K = 2 NetworksThe Importance and Relevance of Kauffman's Explanations of the Order of Gene RegulationAdditional Orderly Facts of TranscriptionThe Order of Network AccuracyThe Accuracy of Connectionist NetworksThe Evolvability of Gene Regulation NetworksLaws of Structure", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1093/bjps/axn005", "venue": null, "journal": "The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science", "mag_id": "1964277513", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["55841587"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:83556594"}

Although multi-atlas segmentation (MAS) has achieved many successes in the medical imaging area, this approach encounters limitations in segmenting anatomical structures associated with poor image contrast. To address this issue, we propose a new MAS method that uses a hypergraph learning framework to model the complex subject-within and subject-to-atlas image voxel relationships and propagate the label on the atlas image to the target subject image. To alleviate the low-image contrast issue, we propose two strategies equipped with our hypergraph learning framework. First, we use a hierarchical strategy that exploits high-level context features for hypergraph construction. Because the context features are computed on the tentatively estimated probability maps, we can ultimately turn the hypergraph learning into a hierarchical model. Second, instead of only propagating the labels from the atlas images to the target subject image, we use a dynamic label propagation strategy that can gradually use increasing reliably identified labels from the subject image to aid in predicting the labels on the difficult-to-label subject image voxels. Compared with the state-of-the-art label fusion methods, our results show that the hierarchical hypergraph learning framework can substantially improve the robustness and accuracy in the segmentation of anatomical brain structures with low image contrast from magnetic resonance (MR) images.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31502994", "doi": "10.1109/TNNLS.2019.2935184", "venue": "IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems", "journal": "IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems", "mag_id": "2972139070", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202412390"}

Currently, the recognition of physical effects from a video is mainly conducted by human experts. Although 4D effects are promising in giving immersive experience and entertainment, this manual production has been the main obstacle to faster and wider application of 4D effects. In this paper, we utilize pretrained models of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract local visual features and propose a new representation method that combines extracted features into video level features.

Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) learning algorithms using a generate and test approach produce hypotheses with redundant literals. Since the reduction is known to be a co-NP-complete problem, most algorithms are incomplete approximations. A complete algorithm proposed by Gottlob and Fermuller is optimal in the number of \u03b8-subsumption calls. However, this method is inefficient since it exploits neither the result of the \u03b8-subsumption nor the intermediary results of similar \u03b8-subsumption calls. Recently, Hirata has shown that this problem is equivalent to finding a minimal solution to a \u03b8-subsumption of a clause with itself, and proposed an incomplete algorithm based on a \u03b8-subsumption algorithm of Scheffer. This algorithm has a large memory consumption and performs many unnecessary tests in most cases. In this work, we overcome this problem by transforming the \u03b8-subsumption problem in a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, then we use an exhaustive search algorithm in order to find a minimal solution.

The current de-facto gold-standard approach to carcinogen testing adopts the two-year rodent bioassay, a time consuming and costly procedure. Alternative approaches, such as high-throughput in-vitro assays, show promise in addressing the limitations in carcinogen screening. Objectives: We developed a screening process for predicting chemical carcinogenicity and genotoxicity and characterizing modes of actions (MoAs) using in-vitro gene expression assays. Methods: We generated a large toxicogenomics resource comprising ~6,000 expression profiles corresponding to 330 chemicals profiled in HepG2 cells at multiple doses and in replicates. Predictive models of carcinogenicity were built using a Random Forest classifier. Differential pathway enrichment analysis was performed to identify pathways associated with carcinogen exposure. Signatures of carcinogenicity and genotoxicity were compared with external data sources including Drugmatrix and the Connectivity Map. Results: Among profiles with sufficient bioactivity, our classifiers achieved 72.2% AUC for predicting carcinogenicity and 82.3% AUC for predicting genotoxicity. Our analysis showed that chemical bioactivity, as measured by the strength and reproducibility of the transcriptional response, is not significantly associated with long-term carcinogenicity, as evidenced by the many carcinogenic chemicals that did not elicit substantial changes in gene expression at doses up to 40 \u03bcM. However, sufficiently high transcriptional bioactivity is necessary for a chemical to be used for prediction of carcinogenicity. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed several pathways consistent with literature review of pathways that drive cancer, including DNA damage and DNA repair.

The key idea is to leverage a large number of similar few-shot tasks in order to learn how to adapt a base-learner to a new task for which only a few labeled samples are available. As deep neural networks (DNNs) tend to overfit using a few samples only, typical meta-learning models use shallow neural networks, thus limiting its effectiveness. In order to achieve top performance, some recent works tried to use the DNNs pre-trained on large-scale datasets but mostly in straight-forward manners, e.g., (1) taking their weights as a warm start of meta-training, and (2) freezing their convolutional layers as the feature extractor of base-learners. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called meta-transfer learning (MTL) which learns to transfer the weights of a deep NN for few-shot learning tasks. Specifically, meta refers to training multiple tasks, and transfer is achieved by learning scaling and shifting functions of DNN weights for each task. In addition, we introduce the hard task (HT) meta-batch scheme as an effective learning curriculum that further boosts the learning efficiency of MTL. We conduct few-shot learning experiments and report top performance for five-class few-shot recognition tasks on three challenging benchmarks: miniImageNet, tieredImageNet and Fewshot-CIFAR100 (FC100). Extensive comparisons to related works validate that our MTL approach trained with the proposed HT meta-batch scheme achieves top performance.

The present paper explores the applications of a special approximation of the Type-2 Fuzzy Inference System, which is the Shadowed Type-2 Fuzzy Inference System, and the reason for using this approach (and not another one) is because it provides a good approximation to General Type-2 Fuzzy Inference Systems, but with a computational cost reduction.

However, visual versus near infrared (VIS-NIR) heterogeneous face recognition (HFR) is still a challenging issue in computer vision community due to the gap between sensing patterns of different spectrums as well as the lack of sufficient training samples. To solve the above problem, in this paper, we present an efficient Disentangled Spectrum Variations Networks (DSVNs) for VIS-NIR HFR. Two key strategies are introduced to the DSVNs for disentangling spectrum variations between two domains: Spectrum-adversarial Discriminative Feature Learning (SaDFL) and Step-wise Spectrum Orthogonal Decomposition (SSOD). The SaDFL consists of Identity-Discriminative subnetwork (IDNet) and Auxiliary Spectrum Adversarial subnetwork (ASANet). On the one hand, the IDNet is composed of a generator $G_H$ and a discriminator $D_U$ for extracting identity-discriminative feature. On the other hand, the ASANet is built by a generator $G_H$ and a discriminator $D_M$ for eliminating modality-variant spectrum information under the guidance of the discriminator $D_M$ ::: . The IDNet is trained using identity-label HFR dataset with triplet loss, while the ASANet is trained using modality-label HFR dataset. Both IDNet and ASANet can jointly enhance the domain-invariant feature representations via an adversarial learning. Furthermore, to disentangle spectrum variations effectively as well as making identity information and modality information unrelated to each other, we present a new topology of connection block called Disentangled Spectrum Variations (DSV). An orthogonality constraint is imposed to DSV at the convolution level for channel-wise orthogonal decomposition between the modality-invariant identity information and modality-variant spectrum information. In particular, the SSOD is built by stacking multiple modularized mirco-block DSV, and thereby enjoys the benefits of disentangling spectrum variation step by step. Moreover, we investigate the similarity calculation method to further improve the HFR performance. To sum up, the designed DSVNs leads to a purification of identity information as well as an elimination of modality information.

In this paper, we got the dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to find a best predictive machine learning model. Since the copy number variations (CNVs) is highly related with the breast cancer, CNVs is used as a fundamental indicator of each genome segmentation in the study.

We tested the predictive power of the Gradient Boosting Machine, Distributed Random Forest, XGBoost and Deep Learning Neural Network. With the different genome segmentation grouping dataset and different machine learning models, we finally found the Gradient Boost Machine is the most powerful model for this problem.

Tag recommendation methods may assist users in this task, improving the quality of the available information and, thus, the effectiveness of various tag-based information retrieval services, such as searching, content recommendation and classification. This work addresses the tag recommendation problem from two perspectives. The first perspective, centered at the object, aims at suggesting relevant tags to a target object, jointly exploiting the following three dimensions: (i) tag co-occurrences, (ii) terms extracted from multiple textual features (e.g., title, description), and (iii) various metrics to estimate tag relevance. The second perspective, centered at both object and user, aims at performing personalized tag recommendation to a target object-user pair, exploiting, in addition to the three aforementioned dimensions, a metric that captures user interests. In particular, we propose new heuristic methods that extend state-of-the-art strategies by including new metrics that estimate how accurately a candidate tag describes the target object. We also exploit three learning-to-rank (L2R) based techniques, namely, RankSVM, Genetic Programming (GP) and Random Forest (RF), for generating ranking functions that exploit multiple metrics as attributes to estimate the relevance of a tag to a given object or object-user pair. We evaluate the proposed methods using data from four popular Web 2.0 applications, namely, Bibsonomy, LastFM, YouTube and YahooVideo. Our new heuristics for object-centered tag recommendation provide improvements in precision over the best state-of-the-art alternative of 12% on average (up to 20% in any single dataset), while our new heuristics for personalized tag recommendation produce average gains in precision of 121% over the baseline. Similar performance gains are also achieved in terms of other metrics, notably recall, Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) and Mean-Reciprocal Rank (MRR). Further improvements, for both object-centered (up to 23% in precision) and personalized tag recommendation (up to 13% in precision), can also be achieved with our new L2R-based strategies, which are flexible and can be easily extended to exploit other aspects of the tag recommendation problem. Finally, we also quantify the benefits of personalized tag recommendation to provide better descriptions of the target object when compared to object-centered recommendation by focusing only on the relevance of the suggested tags to the object. We find that our best personalized method outperforms the best object-centered strategy, with average gains in precision of 10%.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ipm.2014.03.002", "venue": "Inf.

TFC has characteristics as follows: non-parametric learning, no mis-classification of training data. And then, in some real-world problems, the effectiveness of TFC is confirmed through way applications. However, TFC has a problem that it must be reconstructed even when any sub-set of data is changed. ::: In the successive learning, after recognition of a set of unknown objects, they are fed into the classifier in order to obtain a modified classifier.

Methods The US Food and Drug Administration approved methods previously used for the retrospective analysis of suicidality with antidepressants and anticonvulsants. Potential cases of suicidal thoughts and behavior were identified from searches of treatment-emergent adverse event preferred and verbatim terms; a review of serious adverse events; and searches of a priori\u2013identified free text comment fields in the case report forms. Blinded case reports for these potential cases, in addition to all serious adverse events, were categorized by using the Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment. Findings The dataset for this study comprised 1799 patients who received ropinirole (either formulation) and 1258 patients who received placebo. No signal for suicidality was detected for ropinirole in the treatment of patients with RLS.

For overcoming the lack of signature-based and static ransomware detection approach, we have proposed the dynamic ransomware detection system using data mining techniques such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Simple Logistic (SL) and Naive Bayes (NB) algorithms for detecting known and unknown ransomware.

These approaches have shown low prediction accuracy and high bug tossing length (BTL). Objective The objective of this paper is to develop a robust algorithm for reducing BTL based on the concept of developer expertise score (DES). Method None of the existing approaches to the best of our knowledge have utilized metrics to build developer expertise score. The novel strategy of DES is consisted of two stages: Stage-I consisted of an offline process for detecting the developers based on DES which computes the score using priority, versatility and average fix-time for his individual contributions. The online system process consisted of finding the capable developers using three kinds of similarity measures (feature-based, cosine-similarity and Jaccard). Stage-II of the online process consisted of simply ranking the developers. Hit-ratio and reassignment accuracy were used for performance evaluation. We compared our system against the ML-based bug triaging approaches using three types of classifiers: Navies Bayes, Support Vector Machine and C4.5 paradigms. Results By adapting the five open source databases, namely: Mozilla, Eclipse, Netbeans, Firefox, and Freedesktop, covering 41,622 bug reports, our novel DES system yielded a mean accuracy, precision, recall rate and F-score of 89.49%, 89.53%, 89.42% and 89.49%, respectively, reduced BTLs of up to 88.55%. This demonstrates an improvement of up to 20% over existing strategies. Conclusion This work presented a novel developer recommendation algorithm to rank the developers based on a metric-based integrated score for bug triaging. This integrated score was based on the developer's expertise with an objective to improve (i) bug assignment and (ii) reduce the bug tossing length.

To select the most representative instances for learning, a hybrid labeling strategy which includes an uncertainty strategy and an imbalance strategy is proposed. The uncertainty strategy applies a margin-based uncertainty criterion and a dynamic adjustment threshold. Based on the categorical distribution of the last data block, the imbalance strategy prefers to learn instances of the minority category. In addition, it also incorporates the advantages of the traditional random strategy and helps to capture the drifts away from the decision boundary.

Monroe (monroe@usc.edu) Department of Psychology, University of Southern California Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA Abstract A localist constraint satisfaction neural network model is presented to account for a broad collection of attitude and attitude change phenomena. Activations and weights among units in the recurrent network are used to vary the structure and properties of the attitude and a persuasive message. The model uses Hebbian learning to update weights, allowing it to represent long term changes in attitude as well as temporary construction of attitudes. Phenomena modeled include attitude strength, motivated reasoning, and heuristic vs. systematic persuasion. The same set of simple mechanisms is used to model all the phenomena, which allows the model to offer a parsimonious theoretical account of much of the literature on attitude change. The model also provides a specified structural description of attitudes that could lead to new predictions and a more complete understanding of the construct and its effects. Keywords: social cognition; attitudes; computer simulation; neural networks. Introduction Attitudes are not just important to social psychology researchers, but have very immediate and practical implications for everyday life: from stereotypes and prejudice to even larger scale human relations, such as politics, international conflicts, and acts of terrorism. Currently in social psychology there is no general theory of attitudes. Existing theoretical models of attitude change, such as the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM; Petty & Cacioppo, 1986) and Heuristic-Systematic Model (HSM; Chaiken, 1980; Chen & Chaiken, 1999) specify many postulates that address under which conditions attitudes might be more likely to change. Factors that influence the degree of attitude change include characteristics of the persuasive message, characteristics of the source of that message (such as credibility), and characteristics of the message receiver. Multiple pathways to persuasion have been identified and integrated into these models; some involve a minimal amount of thought and others involve quite elaborate, deliberate thought (Chaiken, 1980; Fazio, 1990; Petty & Cacioppo, 1986). The causes and effects of attitude change are not simply predicted though, and most often rest on contingent relationships between factors. These are not models that offer an explanation of the actual process involved. The antecedents of attitude strength are complex as well, the basis of which has proved to be far richer than the sheer amount of knowledge or related experience (Krosnick et al. 1993; Krosnick & Petty, 1995). The current state of attitude research, while sophisticated with respect to the concepts it invokes, ultimately rests not on a unified framework of precise mechanisms, but instead on a set of moderating variables and messy interactions that does not allow more precise prediction. Here I use a connectionist model to account for many of the phenomena with one framework. There are many reasons to think of attitudes as associative networks. I believe the existing research and evidence clearly suggests this kind of formulation. For example, elaboration has been found to be extremely important in predicting many attitude measures (Petty, Haugtvedt, & Smith, 1995), and specifically imparts more substantial and complex internal structure to attitudes (Wegener, Petty, Smoak, & Fabrigar, 2004). Processing of attitude information often proceeds in parallel (Holyoak & Simon, 1999), just as would be expected from a network. Attitudes appear to exhibit constraint satisfaction behavior (Kunda & Thagard, 1996; Simon, Snow, & Read, 2004) and nonlinear effects (Vallacher, Nowak, & Kaufman, 1994). Constraint satisfaction models have been used previously to model limited and specific phenomena related to attitudes. These include cognitive dissonance (Shultz & Lepper, 1996), stereotype acquisition (Queller & Smith, 2002), and hypothesis evaluation (Thagard, 1989). The current model uses a general architecture in a more comprehensive attempt to account for a wider range of attitude phenomena, and in the process offer a parsimonious theoretical unification that is currently lacking, rather than a painstaking reproduction of laboratory results. The Model Architecture The model (Figure 1) uses a recurrent localist connectionist architecture and consists of 102 interconnected units. They are organized into 4 layers for clarity of process and procedural considerations. One unit represents the attitude object. Another unit represents an evaluation dimension. This is consistent with virtually all current attitude theorizing, which says an attitude, minimally, is composed of a target entity or issue, and a connected evaluative component (e.g. Fazio, 1990). The evaluation unit represents not a general good-bad continuum, but the specific dimension of evaluation. Several dimensions could potentially be evaluated at the same time, although this is not explored here. The remaining 100 units are divided up into two parcels: an 80- unit cognitorium (the entire network of cognitions relevant to an attitude) and a 20-unit parcel representing persuasive communications. Both the cognitorium and the persuasive", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2767678475", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": ["39212150", "60554764", "142800662", "207984", "4431505", "187841055", "144923028", "12812766", "144027466", "204380072", "8549670", "20941174", "254992", "26224422", "140222180"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:37690391"}

Cascading of AdaBoost algorithm with LS greatly influences the OFDM system performance. Performance of Adaptive Boosting based symbol recovery was investigated on the performance of LS, MMSE, BLUE were also compared with the performance of AdaBoost algorithm and MMSE has been found the higher computational complexity. Furthermore, MMSE also requires apriori channel statistics and computational complexity O(5N3) of the MMSE increases exponentially as the number of carrier increases. For the Adaboost case the computational complexity calculation is little different.Therefore, in the training stage of the AdaBoost algorithm, the computational complexity is only O(nT M) Furthermore, as it is a classification algorithm so in the receiver side we will require a separate de-mapper (or decoder) to get the desired data bits, i.e., a.

While some methods are useful in some domains, they are not useful in other domains. Therefore it is very difficult to choose one of these methods. For this purpose, we introduce multiple testing based on recursive iteration of resampling methods for rule-induction (MULT-RECITE-R). This method consists of four procedures, which includes the inner loop and the outer loop procedures. First, original training samples(S0) are randomly split into new training samples(S1) and test samples(T1) using a resampling scheme. Second, S1 are again split into training sample(S2) and training samples(T2) using the same resampling scheme. Rule induction methods are applied and predefined metrics are calculated. This second procedure, as the inner loop, is repeated for 10000 times. Then, third, rule induction methods are applied to S1, and the metrics calculated by T1 are compared with those by T2. If the metrics derived by T2 predicts those by T1, then we count it as a success. The second and third procedures, as the outer loop, are iterated for 10000 times. Finally, fourth, the overall results are interpreted, and the best method is selected if the resampling scheme performs well. In order to evaluate this system, we apply this MULT-RECITE-R method to three UCI databases.

The prognosis for PBL has doubled from 40\u201380% 3yr EFS over the past 30 years secondary to the introduction of short and intensive multiagent chemotherapy including fractionated cyclophosphamide, high dose methotrexate and moderate to high dose cytosine arabinoside (Cairo et al Leukemia, 2002, Cairo et al Blood, 2007 and Cairo et al JCO, 2011). However, 20% of children still relapse and the prognosis is dismal in this subgroup (<20% OS) and more importantly the morbidity is extremely high resulting in a high incidence of severe mucositis, systemic infections and prolonged hospitalizations (Cairo et al, Blood 2007). Novel targeted therapy such as rituximab has been recently investigated in PBL (Cairo et al ASCO, 2010). However, additional targeted approaches are needed to reduce both morbidity and prevent relapse. Dave/Staudt et al (NEJM, 2006) at the NCI first identified a group of C-MYC target genes in BL. Subsequently, Klapper et al (Blood, 2008) within the BFM developed a molecular Burkitt lymphoma (MBL) index in PBL. ::: ::: OBJECTIVE: We therefore investigated and compared the genomic expression patterns and more importantly the common cellular functional pathways in PBL specimens obtained from children and adolescents treated on COG-ANHLO1P1 and compared the results to PBL specimens from the Dave/Staudt NCI and Klapper BFM experiences. ::: ::: METHODS: Children and adolescents with newly diagnosed and de-novo advanced PBL were consented and treated on the COG-ANHLO1P1 chemotherapy (Rituximab and FAB chemotherapy) (Cairo et al, ASCO, 2010). Briefly, total RNA was isolated from patient tumor samples,cDNA was generated from 100ng of total RNA, and cDNA was biotin-labeled by in vitro transcription (Affymetrix) as we have previously described (Jiang/Cairo, J. Immun, 2004, Exp Hem, 2009). Fragmented biotin labeled cDNA was hybridized to GeneChip U133A2 and subsequently scanned by GeneChip\u00ae Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix). The data (log values) was imported into GeneSpring GX 10 (Silicon Genetics) and Partek Ingenuity Pathway Analysis IPA 6.5. Additionally COG samples were validated by building a prediction model with Support Vector Machines using the Klapper BFM PBL specimens as training database (NCBI GEO GSEI0172 and [GSE4475][1]) and subsequently compared to Dave/Staudt et al. NCI PBL specimen (GSE 4732) data and analyzed by a one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey multiple comparison test. Furthermore, expression of selected genes was measured by qRT-PCR (Applied Biosystems, ABI7500) and compared to genomic profiling results. ::: ::: RESULTS: Within the 3 groups of PBL specimens there were 1,565 genes identified. There were 375 genes that were significantly over expressed among the 3 cohorts of PBL specimens representing a cross sectional PBL genetic signature. Utilizing the Ingenuity Pathway analysis software (IPA 6.5) we identified that 75% of the overexpressed genes were either protein kinases, receptor / cytokine binding proteins or transcriptional proteins (Figure 1). We further examined several signaling pathways including, JAK-STAT, MAPK and toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways. There was a significant increase in the expression of several antiapoptotic genes in the JAK-STAT pathway including PTPN11 (\u219126F), STAT1 (\u21919F) and PIM1 (\u21916F). Within the MAPK pathway there were several cell growth and proliferation genes significantly overexpressed including MAP2K (\u219112F), RAF1 (\u21919F) and MAPK9 (\u21917F). Lastly within the TLR pathway there was a significant over expression of IRAK1 (\u219123F) and NF- k\u03b2IA (\u219115F). BL classifier genes were also overexpressed: C-MYC (\u219127F) and DLEU1 (\u219110F). Comparative qRT-PCR vs. genomic profiling expression demonstrated consistent results: PTPN11: \u219135F vs. 26F, PIM1: \u21914.7 vs. 5.4F, STAT1: \u219110.3 vs. 9.2F, MAP2K1 \u21918.7 vs. 11.8F, RAF1: \u219121 vs. 9F and DLEU1 \u21918.1 vs. 9.9F. ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS: These comparative genomic data and analyses suggest a common genetic signature of children and adolescents with sporadic PBL in North America and Europe. Furthermore, there are a number of signal transduction pathways with overexpressed protein kinases that maybe amenable to small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors for future molecularly based targeted therapeutic approaches in children and adolescents with BL. ::: ::: Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare. ::: ::: [1]: /lookup/external-ref?link_type=NCBIGEO&access_num=GSE4475&atom=%2Fbloodjournal%2F118%2F21%2F1587.atom", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1182/blood.v118.21.1587.1587", "venue": null, "journal": "Blood", "mag_id": "2559244382", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:79150523"}

As terrestrial measurements are very time consuming and field inventories are often missing, the use of height information automatically derived from high resolution remote sensing data, e.g. digital stereo images, has great potential as an alternative technique to gain knowledge about the forest conditions. The main goal of this study was to arrive at a better exploitation of aerial stereo images by the following tasks: (i) derivation of dense 2.5d point clouds and surface models from digital stereo images via semi-global matching and orthoimage computation, (ii) area-based estimation of dominant tree height, stand density index and standing timber volume at the plot level and (iii) extrapolation of these estimation models to an adjacent forest area. ::: The study is conducted within the Steigerwald test site in the northwestern part of Bavaria, Germany. For two large forested areas (northern part 7742 ha and southern part 3469 ha), field measurements are available from a forest inventory conducted in 2010. In total, 1875 circular inventory plots (each with a size of 500 m\u00c2\u00b2) are located in the northern part and 835 plots in the southern part. The plots are arranged on a regular grid of 200m x 200m in both areas. For each plot, we calculated the dominant tree height, the stand density index and the standing timber volume. Digital aerial images (UltracamXP, PAN & RGBI, 20 cm GSD, forward overlap 75%, side overlap 30%), acquired in May 2011, and a bare-earth digital terrain model (DTM, 1m resolution) from ALS-data are used. ::: Up to now, the following analyses were conducted according to task (i): First, for both data sets, Semi-Global Matching was applied to obtain the absolute elevation of the canopy surface, i.e. 2.5d point clouds and a digital surface model (DSM) with 1m resolution. Second, canopy height models (CHM) were derived by subtracting the ALS-based terrain heights. Third, using the image-based DSM for rectification, we calculated orthoimages (RGBI) with 1m resolution. ::: In order to meet task (ii), subsequently the following explanatory variables were computed separately for each inventory plot: height metrics, amongst others percentiles of the height distribution; variability metrics describing the variability of heights; canopy cover metrics representing the spatial occupancy based on the CHM; color and texture metrics based on the spectral information of the orthoimages. ::: We applied the non-parametric Random Forests approach to generate models for the estimation of dominant tree height, stand density index and standing timber volume based on all plots in the northern part of the test site. Model evaluation was conducted via repeated 10-fold cross-validation and the model accuracies were examined by means of root mean squared error (RMSE) and bias. ::: According to task (iii) of this study, we scrutinize the predictive performance of the models when extrapolating to adjacent forest areas. It is assumed that reasonable predictions to areas outside the calibration test site strongly depend on the similarity of the forest stands with respect to the considered attributes. Thus, the forest attributes derived from the field measurements were compared in terms of their distributions in the two test areas. The non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test was applied for the statistical comparison since none of the three attributes was normally distributed in both areas. The tests revealed, that the distributions from both test areas were not significantly different for dominant tree height (p = 0.4849), stand density index (p = 0.7184) and standing timber volume (p = 0.3099). ::: Proven the similar forest conditions of the two areas, we will use the models built and calibrated in the northern part of the test site to predict the forest attributes for all inventory plots located in the southern part. Consequently, all plots in the southern part will be used as an independent test set. Again, the accuracy will be examined in terms of RMSE and bias to find out if an extrapolation of the area-based models to neighboring forests is feasible. ::: We conclude that the extrapolation method might substantially support forest decision makers for upcoming planning and monitoring tasks, especially if no terrestrial inventory information is available for those forests.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2510803760", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:131846657"}

The sub-image is defined by partitioning the image space into 4\u00d74 non-overlapping blocks So, thepartition of image definitely creates 16 equal-sized blocks regardless of the size of the original image. For texture feature, we used two features namely; Rotated local binary pattern (RLBP) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT). DWT provides an effective, scalable and intuitive representation of colors present in a area or picture. It is used to preserve the detailed contents of the images along with the reduction of the size of the featurevector and it describes the texture feature of an image. The implementation result based on precision and recall. The proposed precision is reached up to 88.37% and recall is decreased as compared to previous approach. For classification, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used. It classifies the data with class labels. The distance is calculated with different similarity metrics like, Manhattan Distance (L1), Euclidean Distance (L2), Jaccard distance (JD), Hamming Distance (HD) and relative standard deviation (RSD).", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/iceca.2017.8212748", "venue": "2017 International conference of Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology (ICECA)", "journal": "2017 International conference of Electronics, Communication and Aerospace Technology (ICECA)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2773673562", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["61403229", "8572491", "42568089", "9317467", "17520766", "61304346", "21133497", "703135", "19565078", "40066889"], "inbound_citations": ["212646680", "199489969"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:43839479"}

However, in many real applications, to provide instance level label is still costly. Thus, weakly supervised approach is proposed and naturally cast as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. Traditional MIL methods typically learn discriminative classifiers from positive and negative training bags. Alternatively, we propose to select more discriminative instances for learning classifiers to further improve detection accuracy. With the candidate set of positive instances, we can also train a Smoothing Latent Support Vector Machine (SLSVM) to finally detect objects from a bag of instances. We observed that object instances of a common category are visually similar and when characterized as high-dimensional feature representations, they approximately lie in a low-dimensional subspace. Therefore, we propose a formulation optimizes a labeling variable for each positive image and learns the subspace model by minimizing rank (via convex surrogate function) of the coefficient matrix associated with the subspace model. To improve discriminative power, we also promote incoherence between the subspace model and some \"hard\" negative instances by utilizing a \u03b5-insensitive loss.

However, there are two major obstacles making it challenging to implement for real life applications: (1) Learning new classes makes the trained model quickly forget old classes knowledge, which is referred to as catastrophic forgetting. (2) As new observations of old classes come sequentially over time, the distribution may change in unforeseen way, making the performance degrade dramatically on future data, which is referred to as concept drift. Current state-of-the-art incremental learning methods require a long time to train the model whenever new classes are added and none of them takes into consideration the new observations of old classes. In this paper, we propose an incremental learning framework that can work in the challenging online learning scenario and handle both new classes data and new observations of old classes. We address problem (1) in online mode by introducing a modified cross-distillation loss together with a two-step learning technique. Our method outperforms the results obtained from current state-of-the-art offline incremental learning methods on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1000 (ILSVRC 2012) datasets under the same experiment protocol but in online scenario.

The visual training samples are collected through the analysis of the spatial and temporal context of media data and events. While collecting positive samples can be achieved easily thanks to dedicated event machine-tags, finding the most representative negative samples from the vast amount of irrelevant multimedia documents is a more challenging task. Here, we argue and demonstrate that the most common negative samples, originating from the same location as the event to be modeled, are best suited for the task. A novel ranking approach is devised to automatically select a set of negative samples. Finally the automatically collected samples are used to learn visual event models using Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Several public efforts are aimed at discovering patterns or classifiers in high-dimensional bioactivity space that predict tissue, organ or whole animal toxicological endpoints. Supervised machine learning is a powerful approach to discover combinatorial relationships in complex in vitro/in vivo datasets. We present a novel model to simulate complex chemical-toxicology data sets and use this model to evaluate the relative performance of different machine learning (ML) methods.ResultsThe classification performance of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Na\u00efve Bayes (NB), Recursive Partitioning and Regression Trees (RPART), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) in the presence and absence of filter-based feature selection was analyzed using K-way cross-validation testing and independent validation on simulated in vitro assay data sets with varying levels of model complexity, number of irrelevant features and measurement noise. While the prediction accuracy of all ML methods decreased as non-causal (irrelevant) features were added, some ML methods performed better than others. In the limit of using a large number of features, ANN and SVM were always in the top performing set of methods while RPART and KNN (k = 5) were always in the poorest performing set. The addition of measurement noise and irrelevant features decreased the classification accuracy of all ML methods, with LDA suffering the greatest performance degradation. LDA performance is especially sensitive to the use of feature selection. Filter-based feature selection generally improved performance, most strikingly for LDA.ConclusionWe have developed a novel simulation model to evaluate machine learning methods for the analysis of data sets in which in vitro bioassay data is being used to predict in vivo chemical toxicology.

Previous studies found that change-proneness prediction cannot work well with limited training data, especially for new projects. To address this issue, the cross-project change-proneness prediction is proposed, which builds a prediction model by using sufficient data form other projects, i.e. the source projects, and predicts the change-prone files in a target project. However, the cross-project prediction is unstable due to the large metric distinction between source projects, leading to a challenge for classifying change-prone files. To improve the cross-project prediction, we propose a Deep Metric Learning (DML) model to minimize such feature distinction before the file classification. Specifically, DML maps files in source projects into a particular space, where files from the same category, e.g. change-prone files, are getting closer while files from different categories are getting further. Besides, we also leverage an over-sampling approach to handle the highly imbalanced dataset for model training. We verify our model on 20 change-proneness datasets, and compare it with 5 cross-project change-proneness models.

Despite the harsh environment and the extreme aridity conditions, drylands are among the most diverse ecosystems that contribute to more than 30 % of the global terrestrial net primary production. Assessing vegetation dynamics through remote sensing for dryland surfaces remain a challenge due to the appearance of soil and non-photosynthetic material that usually cause non-linear scattering of light. This aspect of remote sensing is investigated in this dissertation using mechanistic and unmixing remote sensing approaches to assess net primary productivity of the Chihuahuan Desert. The unmixing approach was demanded by the difficulties associated with assessing vegetation productivity with mechanistic remote sensing. We found that including soil and non-photosynthetic surface covers contribute to the predictions of NPP with Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis, Random Forest and stepwise regression. Erosion is considered one of the main complex drivers that contribute to vegetation cover change. The feedbacks between wind erosion and other environmental, and biological driver have not been fully studied. Wind erosion remains one of the most understudied drivers of shrub encroachment despite the evidence of the association of aeolian transport with grass cover decline and shrub encroachment. In this research, we introduce wind erosion processes as major disturbances to vegetation covers in drylands affecting the health and mortality of vegetation species. We investigated the damaging effects of wind transport on major vegetation community types in the Chihuahuan Desert using a linear wind tunnel. We quantified the damaging effects of sandblasting using plant mapping methods to emphasize leaf loss, color change, stem loss and plant height change. Our sandblasting experiment shows some similarities between the grasses and the shrubs in the response to sandblasting. However, the grasses were more sensitive to sandblasting than the shrubs due to their growing point and growth form. Our finding might explain shrub encroachment phenomena in drylandsAeolian and fluvial processes are fundamental drivers of arid land dynamics because of their effects on soil surfaces and microtopographies. In this research we investigate the coupling effects of wind and water transport in erosion and deposition in ephemeral streams in Moab, UT covering dry and wet periods. We used structure from motion and drone technologies to survey stream over 16 months period to investigate the soil surface elevation change due to wind and water activities. We performed differencing analysis and quantified soil erosion and deposition volume for 5 survey periods.

The readmission rates of ischemic stroke patients are usually higher than those of patients with other chronic diseases. Our aim was to identify the ischemic stroke readmission risk factors and establish a 90-day readmission prediction model for first-time ischemic stroke patients. Methods The readmission prediction model was developed using the extreme gradient boosting (XGboost) model, which can generate an ensemble of classification trees and assign a predictive risk score to each feature. The patient data were split into a training set (5159) and a validation set (911). The prediction results were evaluated with the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and time-dependent ROC curve, which were compared with the outputs from the logistic regression (LR) model. Results A total of 6070 adult patients (39.6% female, median age 67 years) without any ischemic attack (IS) history were included, and 520 (8.6%) were readmitted within 90 days. The XGboost-based prediction model achieved a standard area under the curve (AUC) value of .782 (.729-.834), and the best time-dependent AUC value was .808 in 54 days for the validation set.

Health insurance claims fraud is committed through service providers, insurance subscribers, and insurance companies. The need for the development of a decision support system (DSS) for accurate, automated claim processing to offset the attendant challenges faced by the National Health Insurance Scheme cannot be overstated.

Three GSVM classifiers were evaluated and their results compared.

The 32 samples used as input data for training the three SVR models are represented by the coordination value sets of points extracted from 3-D models built by the 3-D software according to the shapes of 32 actual hairdryer products. To train the SVR model, an adjective (streamline) is used to evaluate all the 32 samples by 37 subjects. Then the scores of all the subjects are averaged to be the target values of the training models. In addition, a technique called k-fold cross-validation (C-V) is used to find the optimal parameter combination for optimizing the SVR models. The performance of the SVR using these three kernels to estimate the product image values is determined by the values of the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The results show that the optimal SVR model using the polynomial kernel performed better than the one using the RBF kernel. However, it is important to note that the mixed kernel had the best performance of the three. It is also shown in this study that the single RBF has a local characteristic and cannot process the broadly distributed data well.

In this work, we first present a novel QR decomposition framework (QRSVM) to efficiently model and solve a large scale SVM problem by capitalizing on low-rank representations of the full kernel matrix rather than solving the problem as a sequence of smaller sub-problems. The low-rank structure of the kernel matrix is leveraged to transform the dense matrix into one with a sparse and separable structure. The modified SVM problem requires significantly lesser memory and computation. Our approach scales linearly with the training set size which makes it applicable to large datasets. This motivates towards our another contribution; exploring a distributed QRSVM framework to solve large-scale SVM classification problems in parallel across a cluster of computing nodes.

Nine meteorological variables, closely associated with daily rainfall variation, are used as inputs to the hybrid model. The causal variables are obtained from a General Circulation Model (GCM). In general, simulation of meteorological variables from GCM is much better than rainfall estimate and observed records of meteorological variables is sparsely available, if not completely unavailable at many locations. Thus, proposed scheme helps to establish the effectiveness of the DL approach in augmenting the quality of rainfall prediction, exploiting the potential of GCM in simulating meteorological variables. The developed hybrid model is applied to twelve different locations in different climatic regimes in terms of daily precipitation characteristics. The proposed hybrid approach is compared with a DL approach namely, Multi-Layered Perceptron (deep MLP) and another machine learning approach namely, Support Vector Regression (SVR). It is also found that the performance of the model gradually decreases as the prediction lead time (in days) increases.

We used an extended version of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with variable-sized feature vectors to efficiently and dynamically extract and classify requirements-related knowledge from the existing documents. To evaluate the performance of our approach intuitively and quantitatively, we used edit distance and precision/recall metrics. We show in three case studies that the snippets extracted by our method are intuitively relevant and reasonably accurate. Furthermore, we found that statistical and linguistic parameters such as smoothing methods, and words contiguity and order features can impact the performance of both extraction and classification tasks.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICSE.2019.00057", "venue": "2019 IEEE/ACM 41st International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)", "journal": "2019 IEEE/ACM 41st International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2954232981", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["644936", "11887728", "45718534", "2427083", "11408831", "14160425", "56591474", "6040861", "7967951", "33698550", "20897558", "5977068", "14071828", "18705553", "23293455", "6831705", "88407", "44317836", "16561259", "18511667", "26317271", "9878859", "18697189", "4701135", "11793083", "11751262", "3068022", "11495042", "18906127", "460862", "32800624", "5548799", "7968277", "1192563", "7923324", "669209", "5309592", "17333959", "5073927", "16292125", "6555412", "10314497", "9685476", "206560877", "52798223", "4918168", "26864239", "4860496", "4703509", "38150955", "11077516", "60827152", "17211369", "8844862", "20998207", "1656528", "32950061", "18287481", "2941443", "10173315", "961425", "1949931", "6695707", "1995619", "798925", "51676558", "52041272", "4634806", "21705916"], "inbound_citations": ["208208137"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:174800046"}

However, some of these alien trees and shrubs have become invasive over time, with important impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem services, and human well-being. Prosopis was introduced in Baringo County, Kenya, in the 1980s, but since then, it has spread rapidly from the original plantations to new areas. To assess land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes and dynamics in Baringo, we used a combination of dry and wet season Landsat satellite data acquired over a seven-year time interval between 1988\u20132016, and performed a supervised Random Forest classification. For each time interval, we calculated the extent of Prosopis invasion, rates of spread, gains and losses of specific LULC classes, and the relative importance of Prosopis invasion on LULC changes. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficients of the LULC classifications ranged between 98.1\u201398.5% and 0.93\u20130.96, respectively. We found that Prosopis coverage increased from 882 ha in 1988 to 18,792 ha in 2016. The highest negative changes in LULC classes were found for grasslands (\u22126252 ha; \u221286%), irrigated cropland (\u2212849 ha; \u221257%), Vachellia tortilis-dominated vegetation (\u22123602 ha; \u221242%), and rainfed cropland (\u22121432 ha; \u221237%). Prosopis invasion alone directly accounted for over 30% of these negative changes, suggesting that Prosopis invasion is a key driver of the observed LULC changes in Baringo County. Although the management of Prosopis by utilization has been promoted in Baringo for 10\u201315 years, the spread of Prosopis has not ::: stopped or slowed down.

The ToC method uses a constrained expression (an expression that always satisfies the differential equation constraints), which transforms the process of solving a differential equation into an unconstrained problem, and is ultimately solved via least-squares. In addition to individual analysis, the two methods are merged into a new methodology, called constrained SMVs (CSVM), by incorporating the SVM method into the ToC framework to solve unconstrained problems. Numerical tests are conducted on three sample problems: one first order linear ODEs, one first order non-linear ODE, and one second order linear ODE. Using the SVM method as a benchmark, a speed comparison is made for all the problems by timing the training period, and an accuracy comparison is made using the maximum error and mean-squared error on the training and test sets.

Understanding these geometrical properties is essential in machine learning in general. An application which has received much attention recently is the investigation of adversarial examples which can be easily identified by humans but which are misleading neural networks. We will argue that these examples can be understood (and consequently avoided) by an investigation of the dimension and geometry of the classification hypersurface of the underlying neural network as a manifold using the tools introduced in this paper.We argue that a key concept in the analysis is the dimension of a manifold. Many machine learning methods use dimension reduction techniques to understand or classify the input data. We point out different definitions of a dimension of a manifold. We use tools from the theory of topological manifolds to introduce local, or intrinsic and global dimensions. The local dimension describes the local similarity between the dataset and a Euclidean space. The global dimension is the lowest dimension of a Euclidean space into which the dataset can be embedded. For a data space with a Riemannian structure the isometric embedding dimension is the lowest dimensional space into which the dataset can be embedded under the condition that the metric tensor is preserved between the two spaces.We introduce a framework for dimension estimation and topological manifold learning based on the measure ratio method to estimate the dimensions and structure of the data manifold. As an illustration we use images of handwritten digits and points of a Klein-bottle embedded in a five-dimensional space. We compare the results obtained by the measure ratio method with the well-known local-principal component analysis estimation.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IJCNN.2019.8852081", "venue": "2019 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)", "journal": "2019 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2979159935", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["62359231", "147780", "16577977", "198120196", "604334", "6706414", "1033682", "51969097", "122900224", "1536455", "14879317", "67408370", "60058376", "1472609", "62066269", "631693", "207252002", "3528443", "10504003", "29913494", "844323", "21341450", "6674407", "1658773", "13248950", "117041671", "121484824", "9820237", "23861094", "12751983", "51604460", "18730754"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:203605294"}

Extraction of target values from the high-dimensional datasets either relies on pixel-wise processing of the full spectral information, appropriate selection of individual bands, or calculation of spectral indices. Limitations of such approaches are reduced classification accuracy, reduced robustness due to spatial variation of the spectral information across the surface of the objects measured as well as a loss of information intrinsic to band selection and use of spectral indices. In this paper we present an improved spatial-spectral segmentation approach for the analysis of hyperspectral imaging data and its application for the prediction of powdery mildew infection levels (disease severity) of intact Chardonnay grape bunches shortly before veraison. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Instead of calculating texture features (spatial features) for the huge number of spectral bands independently, dimensionality reduction by means of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was applied first to derive a few descriptive image bands. Subsequent classification was based on modified Random Forest classifiers and selective extraction of texture parameters from the integral image representation of the image bands generated. Dimensionality reduction, integral images, and the selective feature extraction led to improved classification accuracies of up to [Formula: see text] for detached berries used as a reference sample (training dataset). Our approach was validated by predicting infection levels for a sample of 30 intact bunches. Classification accuracy improved with the number of decision trees of the Random Forest classifier. These results corresponded with qPCR results. An accuracy of 0.87 was achieved in classification of healthy, infected, and severely diseased bunches. However, discrimination between visually healthy and infected bunches proved to be challenging for a few samples, perhaps due to colonized berries or sparse mycelia hidden within the bunch or airborne conidia on the berries that were detected by qPCR. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: An advanced approach to hyperspectral image classification based on combined spatial and spectral image features, potentially applicable to many available hyperspectral sensor technologies, has been developed and validated to improve the detection of powdery mildew infection levels of Chardonnay grape bunches. The spatial-spectral approach improved especially the detection of light infection levels compared with pixel-wise spectral data analysis.

The papers were refereed by an international panel of experts in the field. The workshop is the second held under the auspices of the HLT/NAACL to be directed at issues concerning the scalability of natural language understanding and generation systems. ::: ::: There is a growing need for systems that can understand and generate natural language in applications that require substantial amounts of knowledge as well as reasoning capabilities. Most current implemented systems for natural language understanding (NLU) are decoupled from any reasoning processes, which makes them narrow and brittle. Furthermore, they do not appear to be scalable in the sense that the techniques used in such systems do not appear to generalize to more complex applications. While significant work has been done in developing theoretical underpinnings of systems that use knowledge and reasoning (e.g., development of models of linguistic interpretation using abductive reasoning, intention recognition, formal models of dialogue, formal models of lexical and utterance meaning, and utterance planning), it has often proved difficult to utilize such theories in robust working systems. ::: ::: Another major barrier has been the vast amount of linguistic and world knowledge needed. However, there is now significant progress in compiling the required knowledge, using manual and increasingly automated techniques for ontology and grammar learning. But even as these resources become available, we still lack some key conceptual and computational frameworks that will form the foundation for effective scalable natural language systems, e.g., in terms of incremental processing, dialogical alignment or pragmatics.

{"paper_id": "86479371", "title": "Instrument Identification to improve OR Scheduling: Evaluating an RFID based Approach", "authors": [{"first": "Jeroen", "middle": [], "last": "Koffeman", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Hospitals are under an increased financial pressure, due to a significant growth in demand for healthcare, that is caused by an aging population. The operating rooms account for the largest costs of a hospital, and thus require a cost-efficient management. However, scheduling the operating rooms is a complex task that involves the estimation of surgery duration, which is often inaccurate. Delays in surgery duration, that are not accounted for in the estimation during scheduling, often result in upcoming surgeries being cancelled. Hence, the operating theatres are most of the time not fully utilized, which comes with great costs for the hospital. Poor communication of information about the progress of ongoing surgeries to the operating room (OR) schedulers prevents them from effectively (re)-scheduling accordingly. The OR personnel can not be assigned to additional tasks, and thus, there is a need for automated monitoring of the progress of ongoing surgeries. The instrument usage during surgeries is shown to provide relevant information about the progress of surgeries, using a Random Forest model to estimate surgical phases from intra-operative data.In this thesis, a Radiofrequency Identification (RFID) setup is used to detect instruments, equipped with RFID-tags, that are used by the surgeon during a Total Extraperitoneal Laparoscopic Hernia Repair (TEP) procedure at Reinier de Graaf Gasthuis (RdGG). The setup is evaluated on applicability into a surgical setting, which involves regulatory aspects, acceptance by the OR-personnel, and performance. A pilot study, of which the results are incorporated into realizing actual in-vivo tests, is performed in a near-surgical setting to eval- uate the extent to which the RFID-setup is applicable in a real surgical setting. During the pilot study, a total of 10 procedures is mimicked of which the data, that is extracted from the RFID-setup, is used to generate a Random Forest model that can estimate the surgical phases. The Random Forest model is used to evaluate the performance of the RFID-setup. After complying with all regulations to perform in-vivo testing, a total of three in-vivo tests is executed to evaluate the applicability of the RFID-setup in a real surgical setting. Lastly, a first step has been taken to extend the research to a greater range of surgery types.The RFID-setup has shown the ability to identify instruments, that are equipped with RFID-tags, during surgery. All regulations to perform in-vivo tests are complied with, and no discomfort of the RFID-setup is experienced by the OR-personnel during the in-vivo tests. Hence, future in-vivo testing is warranted to optimize the setup. The Random Forest model can estimate the phases of surgeries (38% overall accuracy), based on instrument usage data that is acquired through an RFID-setup. The current setup, however, needs to be optimized to improve the detection ability. So far, the first step to make the method of instrument identification applicable to a broader range of surgeries has resulted in a prototyped attachment design to equip instruments with RFID-tags. The attachment is designed in such a way that both the attachment and the RFID-tags are interchangeable between instruments. Further development is needed for the design to comply with a selection of regulations to perform in-vivo testing.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2916197507", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:86479371"}

Language mediated visual attention studies have shown sensitivity of the listener to phonological, visual, and semantic similarity when processing a word. In a computational model of language mediated visual attention, that models spoken word processing as the parallel integration of information from phonological, semantic and visual processing streams, we simulate such effects of competition within modalities. Our simulations raised untested predictions about stronger and earlier effects of visual and semantic similarity compared to phonological similarity around the rhyme of the word. Two visual world studies confirmed these predictions. The model and behavioral studies suggest that, during spoken word comprehension, multimodal information can be recruited rapidly to constrain lexical selection to the extent that phonological rhyme information may exert little influence on this process. Keywords: The Visual World Paradigm, Connectionist Modeling, Visual Attention, Spoken Word Comprehension. Introduction Words are complex entities that link representations across multiple modalities (e.g. phonological, orthographic, semantic, visual \u2026). When processing spoken words in natural, \u2018real world\u2019 settings the cognitive system often has access to information from many modalities each of which may provide a reliable source of information that can be used to constrain lexical selection. Yet comparatively little is known about how these various sources of information interact and the temporal structure of this multimodal process. Language mediated visual attention requires the ability to map between information activated by the visual environment and information activated by spoken language. Empirical studies of this process conducted using the visual world paradigm, in which participants view a visual display and simultaneously hear a spoken utterance while their eye gaze is recorded, have helped isolate the types of information involved in this mapping and the temporal structure of this process. Huettig and McQueen (2007), presented participants with scenes that contained objects that overlapped with the spoken target word (e.g. beaker) in either a visual dimension (e.g. bobbin), a semantic dimension (e.g. fork) or shared their phonological onset (e.g. beaver). They observed that participants looked first towards items that shared their phonological onset, then once the speech signal disambiguated between phonological representations of the target and onset competitor, participants looked more towards items that overlapped in either a visual or semantic dimension. Such eye gaze data has been used to index the timing of activation of specific forms of information by the speech signal and further has been offered as a measure of the relative influence of information types during spoken word comprehension. For example, the influence of phonological rhyme overlap on eye gaze in visual world studies is often only marginally significant, and less robust than onset overlap effects (Allopenna et al., 1998;McQueen & Huettig, 2012). This exposes features of the underlying mechanism that have been used to constrain models of speech processing. For example empirical evidence of rhyme effects has proved influential as they are predicted by continuous mapping models of spoken word recognition (e.g. TRACE: McClelland & Elman, 1986). Evidence provided by these studies demonstrates that as a spoken word unfolds information associated with the word in phonological, visual and semantic dimensions is rapidly activated. Further this information can be utilized by the cognitive system to connect the unfolding speech signal to information that has been activated through other modalities. In the case of language mediated visual attention to map to information activated by the visual environment. Although it has been established that phonological rhyme overlap can influence gaze behavior this has only been demonstrated under heavily constrained conditions in which a phonological mapping provides the only connection to spoken target words.

The existing methods typically conduct label propagation independently ahead of supervised cost-sensitive learning.

Our proposed algorithm is focused on detecting scarfing faults on the edge of slab, which is tiny and sometimes indistinct. A machine vision system with a line scan camera was designed, which facilitates the detection of brightness differences and texture differences between well-scarfed and poorly-scarfed slab surface. Scarfing faults are tiny on the edges, so we propose a new segmentation method that takes advantage of capabilities of the line scan camera.

Fifteen vegetation indices were calculated based on these images. In-situ wheat above-ground dry biomass was measured during the HJ-CCD data acquisition.

Then VSVM is investigated for the malignant cases detection. The aim of this step is to decide whether a detected abnormal case is benign or malignant. For the proposed VSVM algorithm, the whole training data are clustered into different soft vicinal areas in feature space by kernel based deterministic annealing (KBDA) method. The choice of different number of clusters makes VSVM be adaptive to different data structures in the input space. We tested the proposed scheme by using 90 clinical mammograms from MIAS database.

The key challenge in Visual Dialogue is thus maintaining a consistent, and natural dialogue while continuing to answer questions correctly. We present a novel approach that combines Reinforcement Learning and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate more human-like responses to questions. The GAN helps overcome the relative paucity of training data, and the tendency of the typical MLE-based approach to generate overly terse answers. Critically, the GAN is tightly integrated into the attention mechanism that generates human-interpretable reasons for each answer. This means that the discriminative model of the GAN has the task of assessing whether a candidate answer is generated by a human or not, given the provided reason. This is significant because it drives the generative model to produce high quality answers that are well supported by the associated reasoning.

In chapter 2, two modelling approaches are described to identify the frequency content of the events. The first one was based on the discrete wavelet transform, and the other was based on the wavelet packet transform.

We integrated spectral enhancement techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) transformation and different MLAs for an accurate mapping of rock types. A conjugate utilization of conventional geological map and spectral enhancement products derived from ASTER data were used for the preparation of a high-resolution reference lithology map. Feature selection and extraction methods were applied on the AVIRIS-NG data to derive different input dataset such as (a) all spectral bands, (b) shortwave infrared bands, (c) Joint Mutual Information Maximization (JMIM) based optimum bands, and (d) optimum bands using PCA, to choose optimum input dataset for automated lithological mapping. The comparative analysis of different MLAs shows that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) outperforms other Machine Learning (ML) models. The SVM achieved an Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa Coefficient (k) of 85.48% and 0.83, respectively, using JMIM based optimum bands. The JMIM based optimum bands were more suitable than other input datasets to classify most of the lithological units (i.e. metabasalt, amphibolite, granite, acidic intrusive and migmatite) within the study area . The sensitivity analysis performed in this study illustrates that the SVM is less sensitive to the number of samples and mislabeling in the model training than other MLAs.

Although the original formulation of the SVM method does not incorporate contextual information, there are different proposals to incorporate this type of information into it. Usually, these proposals modify the SVM training phase or make an integration of SVM classifications using stochastic models. This study presents a new perspective on the development of contextual SVMs. The main concept of this proposed method is to use the contextual information to displace the separation hyperplane, initially defined by the traditional SVM. This displaced hyperplane could cause a change of the class initially assigned to the pixel. To evaluate the classification effectiveness of the proposed method a case study is presented comparing the results with the standard SVM and the SVM post-processed by the mode (majority) filter. An ALOS/PALSAR image, PLR mode, acquired over an Amazon area was used in the experiment.

Most current speech recognition systems use Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to deal with the temporal variability of speech and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are exploited to model the emission probability of the HMM. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Deep Belief Networks(DBNs) have recently proven though to outperform GMMs in modeling the probability of emission in HMMs. Deep architectures such as DBNs with many hidden layers are useful for multilevel feature representation thus building a distributed representation at different levels of a certain input. These networks are first pre-trained as a multi-layer generative model of a window of feature vector without making use of any discriminative information in unsupervised mode. Once the generative pre-training is complete, discriminative fine-tuning is performed to adjust the model parameters to make them better at predicting. Our aim is to study different levels of representation for speech acoustic features that are produced by the hidden layers of DBNs. To this end, we estimate phoneme recognition error and use classification accuracy evaluated with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as a measure of separability between the DBN representations of 61 phoneme classes. In addition, we investigate the relation between different subgroups/categories of phonemes at various representation levels using correlation analysis.

We adopt Martin [1]'s framework, in which this problem is related to a particular definition of resilience. In a widely accepted definition, resilience is the capacity of a system to maintain some of its properties in spite of disturbance. Martin [1] proposed a precise mathematical interpretation of this concept, based on viability theory, together with methods to compute resilience values and restoration action policies. Resilience values are computed as the inverse of the cost for restoring a given interesting property, lost after a disturbance. This framework is very general, and is in principle of high interest for policy support. However, its current practical implementation is limited to problems in low dimensional space and the uncertainties on the parameters of the model are not taken into account. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm in order to deal with problems in higher dimensional space. It uses a classification method, Support Vector Machines, which is very efficient to deal with problems in high dimensional spaces. In addition, it defines more or less cautious action policies, in order to restore the viability of a system [6]. Starting from this new development, we propose an algorithm that integrates the specificities for computing resilience values, and restoration action policies. We apply this new approach to compute resilience values based on a model of lake eutrophication, including three parameters: the amount of phosphorus in the water, the annual phosphorus input from human activities and the amount of phosphorus in the sediments. We also include uncertainties on some parameters of the dynamical model. The results associated with each state of the system are, in one hand, the cost for restoring the property of interest and, on the other hand, the resilience in relation to potential exogenous disturbances. Comparing the results obtained in this paper with those in the literature, this work highlights the state areas where it is crucial to take into account the slow dynamics of the model (i.e. the amount of phosphorus in the sediments). It also emphasizes that the results are sensitive to the uncertainties on the parameters, precisely the parameters that were neglected when using the classical viability algorithm. To conclude, the combination of the definition of resilience proposed by [1] and the new algorithm of viability introduced in this paper offers an interesting approach to sustainable development, enabling to compute resilience values and restoration action policies on more realistic models than previously.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2905903774", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["53309505", "85409358", "13411972", "864876", "83974175", "120503482", "64543020", "28637672"], "inbound_citations": ["3773570", "15001700"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:133866016"}

This paper proposes an effective way to automatically collect large scales of news-related multi-document summaries with reference to social media's reactions. We utilize two types of social labels in tweets, i.e., hashtags and hyper-links. Hashtags are used to cluster documents into different topic sets. Also, a tweet with a hyper-link often highlights certain key points of the corresponding document. We synthesize a linked document cluster to form a reference summary which can cover most key points. To this aim, we adopt the ROUGE metrics to measure the coverage ratio, and develop an Integer Linear Programming solution to discover the sentence set reaching the upper bound of ROUGE. Since we allow summary sentences to be selected from both documents and high-quality tweets, the generated reference summaries could be abstractive. Both informativeness and readability of the collected summaries are verified by manual judgment. In addition, we train a Support Vector Regression summarizer on DUC generic multi-document summarization benchmarks. With the collected data as extra training resource, the performance of the summarizer improves a lot on all the test sets.

Indeed, while current ML systems have achieved impressive results in avariety of tasks, an obvious bottleneck appears to be the huge amount of labeleddata needed. This paper builds on the idea that data representation, which arelearned in an unsupervised manner, can be key to solve the problem. Classicalstatistical learning theory focuses on supervised learning and postulates that asuitable hypothesis space is given. In turn, under very general conditions, thelatter can be seen to be equivalent to a data representation. In other words,data representation and how to select and learn it, is classically not consideredto be part of the learning problem, but rather as a prior information. In practicead hoc solutions are often empirically found for each problem.The study in this paper is a step towards developing a theory of learningdata representation.

{"paper_id": "36855101", "title": "Modelling uncertainty in touch interaction", "authors": [{"first": "Daryl", "middle": [], "last": "Weir", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Touch interaction is an increasingly ubiquitous input modality on modern devices. It appears on devices including phones, tablets, smartwatches and even some recent laptops. Despite its popularity, touch as an input technology suffers from a high level of measurement uncertainty. This stems from issues such as the \u2018fat finger problem\u2019, where the soft pad of the finger creates an ambiguous contact region with the screen that must be approximated by a single touch point. In addition to these physical uncertainties, there are issues of uncertainty of intent when the user is unsure of the goal of a touch. Perhaps the most common example is when typing a word, the user may be unsure of the spelling leading to touches on the wrong keys. ::: ::: The uncertainty of touch leads to an offset between the user\u2019s intended target and the touch position recorded by the device. While numerous models have been proposed to model and correct for these offsets, existing techniques in general have assumed that the offset is a deterministic function of the input. We observe that this is not the case \u2014 touch also exhibits a random component. We propose in this dissertation that this property makes touch an excellent target for analysis using probabilistic techniques from machine learning. These techniques allow us to quantify the uncertainty expressed by a given touch, and the core assertion of our work is that this allows useful improvements to touch interaction to be obtained. ::: ::: We show this through a number of studies. In Chapter 4, we apply Gaussian Process regression to the touch offset problem, producing models which allow very accurate selection of small targets. In the process, we observe that offsets are both highly non-linear and highly user-specific. In Chapter 5, we make use of the predictive uncertainty of the GP model when applied to a soft keyboard \u2014 this allows us to obtain key press probabilities which we combine with a language model to perform autocorrection. In Chapter 6, we introduce an extension to this framework in which users are given direct control over the level of uncertainty they express. We show that not only can users control such a system succesfully, they can use it to improve their performance when typing words not known to the language model. Finally, in Chapter 7 we show that users\u2019 touch behaviour is significantly different across different tasks, particularly for typing compared to pointing tasks. We use this to motivate an investigation of the use of a sparse regression algorithm, the Relevance Vector Machine, to train offset models using small amounts of data.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1863087344", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["6731031"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:36855101"}

The method is based on a supervised pattern recognition technique called the Support Vector Machine (SVM). The classification relies on differences in signal energy distribution between natural and artificial seismic sources. We filtered seismic records via 20 narrow band-pass filters and divided them into four phase windows: P, P coda, S, and S coda. We then computed a short-term average (STA) value for each filter channel and phase window. The 80 discrimination parameters served as a training model for the SVM. We calculated station specific SVM models for 19 on-line seismic stations in Finland. The training data set included 918 positive (earthquake) and 3469 negative (non-earthquake) examples. An independent test period determined method and rules for integrating station-specific classification results into network results. Finally, we applied the network classification rules to independent evaluation data comprising 5435 fully automatic event determinations, 5404 of which had been manually identified as explosions or noise, and 31 as earthquakes. The SVM method correctly identified 94% of the non-earthquakes and all but one of the earthquakes.The result implies that the SVM tool can identify and filter out blasts and spurious events from fully automatic event solutions with a high level of accuracy. The tool helps to reduce the work-load and costs of manual seismic analysis by leaving only a small fraction of automatic event determinations, the probable earthquakes, for more detailed seismological analysis. The self-learning approach presented here is flexible and easily adjustable to the requirements of a denser or wider high-frequency network.

Among all techniques of FRF, the support vector machine (SVM) is the most newly developed, and one of the most accurate and effective techniques. This study is devoted to investigating an ensemble model of FRF by integrating bagging with an SVM to generate a data-driven SVM ensemble. Bagging is used to produce diverse training datasets on which multiple SVM classifiers are trained to make FRF for a target company. Simple voting is employed to produce a final decision from the SVM model committee. The empirical study has two objectives. One is to verify whether the data-driven SVM ensemble can produce a more dominating performance than the most frequently used techniques in the area of FRF, i.e. multivariate discriminant analysis, logistics regression and a single SVM. The other is to verify whether feature selection is necessary to help the SVM make more precise FRF, although the SVM can handle high-dimensional data. The results indicate that the data-driven SVM ensemble significantly improves the predictive ability of SVM-based FRF. Meanwhile, feature selection can effectively help the SVM achieve better predictive performance, which means that use of feature selection is necessary in SVM-based FRF.

We also discuss some limitations of our method with respect to the types of texture images it can synthesize, and compare it to other neural techniques for texture generation.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": "1611.08207", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "NIPS 2016 adversarial learning workshop, Barcelona, Spain", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2557969682", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["6662846", "9334387", "54970", "1282515", "8643626", "5878719", "1033682", "5808102", "980236", "6628106", "8970570", "2475577", "11758569", "12998557", "2865509", "16728483"], "inbound_citations": ["12487207", "215513651", "209495570", "36546776", "4727549", "53719694", "53222272", "104292364", "139104189", "11922819", "11403417", "211677591", "54444136", "155107383", "204872394", "153311930", "51976141", "51880208", "102352826", "71152259", "12471895", "209334443", "198120048", "3635311", "174797842", "38737775", "145052179", "209439636", "160010170", "129945843", "37974113", "204836706", "118674460", "214641222", "203566608", "59222691", "57825667", "4872519", "88523028", "513287", "85529479", "195883603", "210839653", "208002447", "21661885", "211041462", "208139437", "3310767", "196150698", "54796531", "211554149", "211020816", "3345908", "119255466", "209521274", "59234295", "204734230", "52287627", "215548219", "198986262", "49569686"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2581941"}

We survey a range of models of cognitive development in infants and children and identify the constraints on self-organization that lead to the emergence of target behaviors.

The idea is to learn a metric space induced from a normed vector space on which data from different classes are well separated. Different measures of the separation thus lead to various designs of the objective function in the metric learning model. One classical metric is the Mahalanobis distance, where a linear transformation matrix is designed and applied on the original dataset to obtain a new subspace equipped with the Euclidean norm. The kernelized version has also been developed, followed by Multiple-Kernel learning models. In this paper, we consider metric learning to be the identification of the best kernel function with respect to a high class separability in the corresponding metric space. The contribution is twofold: 1) No pairwise computations are required as in most metric learning techniques; 2) Better flexibility and lower computational complexity is achieved using the CLAss-Specific (Multiple) Kernel - Metric Learning (CLAS(M)K-ML). The proposed techniques can be considered as a preprocessing step to any kernel method or kernel approximation technique.

To achieve the goal, we propose a positive and unlabeled multi-graph learning (puMGL) framework to first select informative subgraphs to convert graphs into a feature space. To utilize unlabeled bags for learning, puMGL assigns a confidence weight to each bag and dynamically adjusts its weight value to select \"reliable negative bags.\" A number of representative graphs, selected from positive bags and identified reliable negative graph bags, form a \"margin graph pool\" which serves as the base for deriving subgraph patterns, training graph classifiers, and further updating the bag weight values.

The GAN has shown its capability in a variety of applications. In this paper, the usefulness and effectiveness of GAN for classification of hyperspectral images (HSIs) are explored for the first time. In the proposed GAN, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to discriminate the inputs and another CNN is used to generate so-called fake inputs. The aforementioned CNNs are trained together: the generative CNN tries to generate fake inputs that are as real as possible, and the discriminative CNN tries to classify the real and fake inputs. This kind of adversarial training improves the generalization capability of the discriminative CNN, which is really important when the training samples are limited. Specifically, we propose two schemes: 1) a well-designed 1D-GAN as a spectral classifier and 2) a robust 3D-GAN as a spectral\u2013spatial classifier. Furthermore, the generated adversarial samples are used with real training samples to fine-tune the discriminative CNN, which improves the final classification performance. The proposed classifiers are carried out on three widely used hyperspectral data sets: Salinas, Indiana Pines, and Kennedy Space Center. The obtained results reveal that the proposed models provide competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

However, the performance of conventional reconstruction algorithms is usually limited by complex and uncertain physical parameters due to heterogeneous tissue structure. In recent years, deep learning has emerged to show great potential in the reconstruction problem. In this work, for the first time to our best knowledge, we propose to infuse the classical signal processing and certified knowledge into the deep learning for PA imaging reconstruction.

Instead we relate features in different feature-spaces through the construction of metafeatures. We show how these techniques can utilize multiple source datasets to construct an ensemble learner which further improves performance. We apply FSR to an activity recognition problem and a document classification problem. The ensemble technique is able to outperform all other baselines and even performs better than a classifier trained using a large amount of labeled data in the target domain.

A novel approach involving the decomposition of gestures into single handed or double handed gesture has been presented in this paper. Classifying gesture into these subcategories simplifies the process of gesture recognition in the ISL due to presence of lesser number of gestures in each subcategory.

However, these variables are generally not available over ungauged catchments. ETo estimation usually needs measurements of weather variables such as wind speed, air temperature, solar radiation and dew point. After the development of reanalysis global datasets such as the National Centre for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and high performance modelling framework Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, it is now possible to estimate the rainfall and ETo for any coordinates. In this study, the WRF modelling system was employed to downscale the global NCEP reanalysis datasets over the Brue catchment, England, U.K. After downscaling, two statistical bias correction schemes were used, the first was based on sophisticated computing algorithms i.e., Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), while the second was based on the more simple Generalized Linear Model (GLM). The statistical performance indices for bias correction such as %Bias, index of agreement (d), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Correlation (r) indicated that the RVM model, on the whole, displayed a more accomplished bias correction of the variability of rainfall and ETo in comparison to the GLM. The study provides important information on the performance of WRF derived hydro-meteorological variables using NCEP global reanalysis datasets and statistical bias correction schemes which can be used in numerous hydro-meteorological applications.

Labeling errors were categorized as mislabeled, unlabeled, partially labeled, incompletely labeled and illegible label. In this study, the focus will be on mislabeled data. The problem of dealing with mislabeled data and in particular of constructing a classifier from such data has been approached from a number of different directions. Therefore, developing learning algorithms that effectively and efficiently deal with mislabeled data is a great practical importance and key aspect in machine learning. Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been widely accepted to be one of the most effective techniques in machine learning algorithms. One of the main drawbacks of SVM is it depends on only a small part of the data points (support vectors) and it treats all training data of a given class equally. To address this problem, one of the solution is the Weighted Support Vector Machines (WSVM). Wu & Liu proposed two different WSVM namely one-step WSVM (OWSVM) and iteratively WSVM (IWSVM). In this paper, a comparison of Weighted Support Vector Machine (WSVM), One-step WSVM (OWSVM) and Iteratively WSVM (IWSVM) for mislabeled data has been done to see the classification accuracy of each of the method. The three methods were compared based on correctly labeled, mislabeled data, data within margin, mislabeled data within margin and classification accuracy for eight KEEL repository datasets using 20% noise in training data. Based on the experimental results, the performance of OWSVM is better than both WSVM and IWSVM based on the correctly labeled, mislabeled data, data within margin, mislabeled data within margin and classification accuracy.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-36056-6_43", "venue": "SCDM", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2994004996", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209387665"}

With the development of information technology, computer vision-based plant identification is an effective and efficient solution. Many tradition plant identification algorithms utilize only one type of plant images, such as images from leaves, flowers and stems etc., which may bring misclassifications. In order to recognize plant accurately, we propose a new plant identification scheme based on image set analysis. In this method, uses image set as a taxonomic unit, each image set consists of multiple images (whole plant, fruits, leaves, flowers, stems, branches, leaves scan), the characteristics of plants are fused together as a basis for plant identification. Compared to the traditional single feature, this study has more characteristics and provides more information in the classification process. A face recognition algorithm based on image collection is used in our research, for example: AHISD/CHISD (Affine/Convex Hull based Image Set Distance), PLRC (Pairwise Linear Regression Classification), SSDML (Set-to-Set Distance Metric Learning), SANP (Sparse Approximated Nearest Point), RNP (Regularized Nearest Points). Data set contains 64,150 plant images, it can be divided into 369 training set (each training set contains 50 pictures) and 914 test sets (each test set contains 50 picture). The results show that CHISD has the highest recognition rate, at 77.02%, which is more suitable for requiring higher accuracy. RNP identifies a plant class took an average of 0.75 s, the algorithm is more suitable for the occasion with higher time requirement.

Because of the large number of variables involved in motor control studies, such multivariate methods have much to offer over the standard univariate techniques that are currently employed in the field to detect modifications. The SVM was used to uncover the principle differences underlying several variations of the task. Five variants of the task were used. An unconstrained reaching, two constrained at the focal level and two at the postural level. Using the electromyographic (EMG) data, the SVM proved capable of distinguishing all the unconstrained from the constrained conditions with a success of approximately 80% or above. In all cases, including those with focal constraints, the collective postural muscle EMGs were as good as or better than those from focal muscles for discriminating between conditions. This was unexpected especially in the case with focal constraints. In trying to rank the importance of particular features of the postural EMGs we found the maximum amplitude rather than the moment at which it occurred to be more discriminative. A classification using the muscles one at a time permitted us to identify some of the postural muscles that are significantly altered between conditions. In this case, the use of a multivariate method also permitted the use of the entire muscle EMG waveform rather than the difficult process of defining and extracting any particular variable. The best accuracy was obtained from muscles of the leg rather than from the trunk. By identifying the features that are important in discrimination, the use of the SVM permitted us to identify some of the features that are adapted when constraints are placed on a complex motor task.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3144191", "pubmed_id": "21814541", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0020732", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2020967192", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["63148422", "142738853", "72100639", "152195361", "10132959", "5173538", "1398308", "123997496", "62616044", "4934687", "10163166", "570952", "15453120", "14838139", "33926069", "37774764", "28637672", "7138354", "206787478", "59640222", "2872125", "37436499", "1206", "8059361", "21013634", "17625511", "7382684", "16919572", "23871994", "1276216", "9290258", "11848958", "18376880", "1846", "25816033"], "inbound_citations": ["6077267", "8752532", "18452148", "16834915", "204939807", "215214963", "11549718", "13699191"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2276720"}

How to monitor the working conditions of roller bearings are focus study in the world. Monitoring the vibration signals of roller bearings is important indirect mean for that they reveal the characteristics and feature of roller bearing faults. Therefore, monitor the vibration signals and diagnose the working states of roller bearings are widely used to ensure the safety operation of the machines. This paper studies a novel roller bearing faults discrimination method with harmonic wavelet packet and Multi-classification Relevance Vector Machine (MRVM). Indeed, the fault discrimination is a pattern recognition process including feature extraction and faulty patterns recognition. Therefore, this paper collects vibration signals and decomposes them with harmonic wavelet packet. After the wavelet coefficients of each node are available, compute the vector energy by corresponding coefficients. The feature vector is prepared after the vector energy has been standardized. With MRVM, the paper proposes three fault discrimination methods in order to identify good bearing, bearing with inner race fault, bearing with outer race fault and bearing with roller fault. The Decision Tree (DT) model, One Against Rest (OAR) model and One Against One (OAO) model are used to propose the classification methods respectively. The proposed OAO model is simplified in order to improve the computation efficiency and simplify the architecture of the model. Finally, capture the vibration signal from the roller bearing stand of electric engineering lab and the roller bearing fault simulation stand QPZZ-II to illustrate the proposed methods. The proposed feature extraction method with harmonic wavelet packet is compared with conventional wavelet packet. With the previous feature vectors, the accuracy and efficiency of the three fault discrimination methods are compared. The accuracy and efficiency of three fault discrimination methods are compared under different conditions including developing faults, noise involving and several faults developing simultaneously.

It was found that the drop of classification accuracy caused by such training data substitution ranged between 2.2% and 3.5% for deep learning models and between 5.5% and 13.25% for conventional methods such as LBP + Random Forests.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1904.08688", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-35430-5_9", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2936654725,2991438438", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2088679", "10988335", "52289143", "52305483", "11758569", "3568073"], "inbound_citations": ["210878083"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:121119934"}

Most traditional technologies usually first deploy a number of reference nodes which are able to communicate with each other, then select only some wireless links, whose signals are affected the most by the transceiver-free target, to estimate the target position. However, such traditional technologies adopt an ideal model for the target, the other link information and environment interference behavior are not considered comprehensively. In order to overcome this drawback, we propose a method which is able to precisely estimate the transceiver-free target position. It not only can leverage more link information, but also take environmental interference into account. Two algorithms are proposed in our system, one is Best K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm, the other is Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithm. Our experiments are based on TelosB sensor nodes and performed in different complex lab areas which have many different furniture and equipment. The experiment results show that the average localization error is round 1.1m.

Moreover, this capability benefits the stability of GANs. Our method takes advantages of both GANs and non-adversarial methods, as it is capable of both reconstructing training images and generating new high-quality images. Instead of learning a images representation by employing an encoder, we directly optimize a learnable image representation set for image reconstruction. Besides image reconstruction, adversarial regularization is adopted to match the aggregated distribution of the latent image representation with arbitrary prior distribution. Our framework is flexible as it is implemented by adding a latent image representation set and a representation discriminator to vanilla GANs. Experimental results show that our models are capable of reconstructing training images and mode collapse is alleviated significantly.

The dew point temperature is a significant parameter particularly required in various hydrological, climatological and agronomical related researches. This study proposes Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) models for the estimation of daily dew point temperature.

Following Rosch\u2019s (1975) analytical approach of concept formation, Younger (1985) showed that 10-month-olds could form one or two visual categories due to the experimental manipulation where the infants experienced the restricted or full range of feature covariance. The training and testing schemes in this simulation study were designed to mimic the same procedure of Younger\u2019s (1985) two experimental conditions. A fully connected two layer SOM network was constructed embedded with Kohonen competitve learning algorithm containing 4 and 143 nodes in the input layer and output layer respectively. Initially all connection weightings were randomly assigned decimal values (from 0 to 1). The quantity values of features of traing and testing pictures were converted into normalized vectors and consisted input and output patterns. For the training session, each network received 8 training input patterns with random sequential order and updated connection weightings afterwards. During the following testing session, 3 novel testing patterns were randomly fed to networks for validating the performance of networks. Mareschal & French (2000) proposed a three-layer feed-forward Autoencoder connectionist network which has the same number of input nodes and output nodes applied with a supervised error-correction algorithm to simulate Younger\u2019s (1985) study results. They assume that how infants process the familiarisation and testing tasks could be analogous to a specific training and testing regime of networks and suggest that infant\u2019s looking time are equivalent to the output errors of networks with positive correlation fashion. However, there are two crucial difficulties found when we tried to replicate Mareschal & French\u2019s (2000) simulations: 1) only the \u2018batch\u2019 updating training more could lead to a successful simulation outcome instead of the \u2018pattern\u2019 updating mode, which is a more realistic scenario for implementing humane cognitive processes, and 2) the output patterns of error could not completely fit Younger\u2019s (1985) experimental findings while considering all comparisons of experimental results. Results Compared with the experimental results (Younger, 1985), the outcome of SOM simulations indicates that, with \u2018pattern\u2019 updating training mode, networks can successfully simulate the processes of category formation based on the overall adjusted distances between the most activated output nodes and its neighbour nodes. The appealing properties of being more biologically plausible could provide an alternaltive to verify the underlying mechanisms about how young infants coin their primitive concepts and what kinds of information they require. Objective In contrast to Autoencoder model, we constructed a two-layer unsupervised connectionist model to simulate the same experimental tasks of categorisation processes in order to conquer those drawbacks. This model, based on the processing principles of \u2018Self-Organising Map\u2019 (SOM) (Kohonen, 1998) was considered to compute the property of similarity of features. Therefore, it was expected the convergence of output nodes would result in clusters topologically through the dynamic competition between network nodes without any explicit desired target value for the output nodes set required in Autoencoder networks. Besides, a substantial difference of SOM to Autoencoder regarding the investigation of the category formation, we reason, is the assumption that the amount of summed distances calculated between output nodes are parallel to the length of looking time observed from experiments.

An emerging field -- computational pathology -- applies such machine learning algorithms to the highly specialized vision task of diagnosing cancer or other diseases from pathology images. Importantly, labeling pathology images requires pathologists who have had decades of training, but due to the demands on pathologists9 time (e.g. clinical service) obtaining a large annotated dataset of pathology images for supervised learning is difficult.

In this paper, we extend this framework to the domain of bounded real variables which can be applied towards optimizing the dual cost function of a generic support vector machine (SVM). The approach can, therefore, not only be used to train traditional soft-margin binary SVMs, one-class SVMs, and probabilistic SVMs but can also be used to design novel variants of SVMs with different types of convex and quasi-convex loss functions. In this paper, we propose an efficient training algorithm based on polynomial growth transforms, and compare and contrast the properties of different SVM variants using several synthetic and benchmark data sets. The preliminary experiments show that the proposed multiplicative update algorithm is more scalable and yields better convergence compared to standard quadratic and nonlinear programming solvers.

Those forests are conditioned on the expression label of the first frame to reduce the variability of the ongoing expression transitions. When testing on a specific frame of a video, pairs are created between this frame and the previous ones. Predictions for each previous frame are used to draw trees from Pairwise Conditional Random Forests (PCRF) whose pairwise outputs are averaged over time to produce robust estimates.

The biggest challenge of integrating these two machine learning frameworks is how to estimate the probability of a logic clause only from the observation of grounded logic atoms. Many current methods models a joint probability by representing clause as graphical model and literals as vertices in it. This model is still too complicate and only can be approximate by pseudo-likelihood.

Visual features such as head orientation, eye gaze and confidence ratings are extracted, then statistical methods are used to perform failure analysis and calibration on the visual features. Non-visual features such as steering wheel angle and indicator position are extracted from a RaceLogic VBOX system. The approach is evaluated on a dataset containing multiple 60 second samples from 14 participants recorded while driving in a natural environment. We compare our multimodal approach to separate unimodal approaches using both Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forests (RF) classifiers. RF Mean Decrease in Gini Index is used to rank selected features which gives insight into the selected features and improves the classifier performance.

In this work, we define anything on roads that are within a certain distance of a driving vehicle and pose potential dangers for it as anomalies, such as traffic accidents, reckless driven vehicles and pedestrians. The proposed approach recognizes anomalies in urban road scenes by analysing appearances of single images captured by cameras on driving vehicles. To do so, first, we collect a large number of urban road scene images that do not contain any anomalies. Second, we segment the road regions from these images and represent the obtained road regions based on the bag of visual words method. After that, we apply k-means clustering to the region representations for acquiring a small set of reference images. Third, we establish dense correspondence between input images and the reference images to create representations for the input images. Following that, representations of normal images are used to train a one-class Support Vector Machine classifier. Finally, we use the classifier to recognize images containing anomalies.

The first one focuses on the use of the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization method instead of the orthogonal projection process adopted by the classic algorithm. The second one is focused on the development of a new implementation of the algorithm on commodity graphics processing units (GPUs). The proposed GPU implementation properly exploits the GPU architecture at low level, including shared memory, and provides coalesced accesses to memory that lead to very significant speedup factors, thus taking full advantage of the computational power of GPUs. The GPU implementation is specifically tailored to hyperspectral imagery and the special characteristics of this kind of data, achieving real-time performance of ATDCA for the first time in the literature. The proposed optimizations are evaluated not only in terms of target detection accuracy but also in terms of computational performance using two different GPU architectures by NVIDIA: Tesla C1060 and GeForce GTX 580, taking advantage of the performance of operations in single-precision floating point.

Since B cell epitopes that are recognized by the IgE antibodies act as antigenic determinants for allergy, they play a vital role in diagnostics. Hence, knowledge of an IgE binding epitope in a protein is of particular interest for identifying aller-genic proteins. Though IgE epitopes maybe conformational or linear, identification of the later is useful especially in food allergens that undergo processing or digestion. Very few computational tools are available for the prediction of linear IgE epitopes. Here we report a prediction system that predicts the exact linear IgE epitope. Since our earlier study on linear B cell epitope prediction demonstrated the effectiveness of using an exact epitope dataset (in contrast to epitope containing region datasets), the dataset in this study uses only experimentally verified exact IgE, IgG, IgM and IgA epitopes. Models for Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) were constructed adopting Dipeptide Deviation from the Expected mean (DDE) feature vector.

In this paper, a labelling method for the semantic analysis of ultra-high point density MLS data (up to 4000 points/m 2 ) in urban road corridors is developed based on combining a conditional random field (CRF) for the context-based classification of 3D point clouds with shape priors. The CRF uses a Random Forest (RF) for generating the unary potentials of nodes and a variant of the contrastsensitive Potts model for the pair-wise potentials of node edges. The foundations of the classification are various geometric features derived by means of co-variance matrices and local accumulation map of spatial coordinates based on local neighbourhoods. Meanwhile, in order to cope with the ultra-high point density, a plane-based region growing method combined with a rule-based classifier is applied to first fix semantic labels for man-made objects. Once such kind of points that usually account for majority of entire data amount are pre-labeled; the CRF classifier can be solved by optimizing the discriminative probability for nodes within a subgraph structure excluded from pre-labeled nodes. The process can be viewed as an evidence fusion step inferring a degree of belief for point labelling from different sources. The MLS data used for this study were acquired by vehicle-borne Z+F phase-based laser scanner measurement, which permits the generation of a point cloud with an ultra-high sampling rate and accuracy. The test sites are parts of Munich City which is assumed to consist of seven object classes including impervious surfaces, tree, building roof/facade, low vegetation, vehicle and pole. The competitive classification performance can be explained by the diverse factors: e.g. the above ground height highlights the vertical dimension of houses, trees even cars, but also attributed to decision-level fusion of graph-based contextual classification approach with shape priors. The use of context-based classification methods mainly contributed to smoothing of labelling by removing outliers and the improvement in underrepresented object classes. In addition, the routine operation of a context-based classification for such high density MLS data becomes much more efficient being comparable to non-contextual classification schemes.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-2-W7-971-2017", "venue": null, "journal": "ISPRS - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2755605798", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": ["18826537", "11157651", "61936075", "207251944", "10128146", "9923302", "15878485"], "inbound_citations": ["203119028", "61806176", "52559534"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55989338"}

Methods: MR ventilation maps were generated and registered to thoracic CT datasets. Images were segmented into volumes of interest (15x15x15mm), resulting in approximately 6,000 volumes-of-interest per subject participant. 85 firstorder and texture features were calculated to describe each volume, including a new texture feature based on the size and occurrence of CT clusters (we called the cluster volume matrix), which is similar to run-length-matrix. A Logistic Regression, Linear Support Vector Machine and Quadratic Support Vector Machine were trained using 5-fold crossvalidation on a cohort of seven subjects. The highest performing classification model was then applied to a test cohort of three subjects. Results: There was qualitative spatial agreement for the experimental MRI ventilation maps and the CT-predicted functional maps.

In this thesis, we propose Triangular Similarity Metric Learning (TSML) for automatically specifying a metric from data. A TSML system is loaded in a siamese architecture which consists of two identical sub-systems sharing the same set of parameters. Each sub-system processes a single data sample and thus the whole system receives a pair of data as the input. The TSML system includes a cost function parameterizing the pairwise relationship between data and a mapping function allowing the system to learn high-level features from the training data. In terms of the cost function, we first propose the Triangular Similarity, a novel similarity metric which is equivalent to the well-known Cosine Similarity in measuring a data pair. Based on a simplified version of the Triangular Similarity, we further develop the triangular loss function in order to perform metric learning, i.e. to increase the similarity between two vectors in the same class and to decrease the similarity between two vectors of different classes. Compared with other distance or similarity metrics, the triangular loss and its gradient naturally offer us an intuitive and interesting geometrical interpretation of the metric learning objective. In terms of the mapping function, we introduce three different options: a linear mapping realized by a simple transformation matrix, a nonlinear mapping realized by Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP) and a deep nonlinear mapping realized by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). With these mapping functions, we present three different TSML systems for various applications, namely, pairwise verification, object identification, dimensionality reduction and data visualization.

They combine several results from statistical learning theory, optimisation theory, and machine learning, and employ kernels as one of their most important ingredients. The present work covers the theory of SVMs with emphasis on SVMs for regression estimation, and the problem of chaotic time series prediction. It is organised in three parts. In the first part, the building blocks that contribute to the theory of SVMs are introduced. The necessary results from statistical learning theory, optimisation theory and kernels are summarised in a modular and self-contained way that makes them accessible as well to readers without background in these topics. The exposition complements already existing material on SVMs in so far as introductory literature that covers all theory employed by SVMs is hard to find. By viewing the function estimation problem as a learning problem, results from statistical learning theory allow the construction of linear learning machines. An application of Lagrangian theory casts these learning machines in forms that constitute the support vector algorithms for classification and regression estimation, which can employ rich classes of nonlinear modelling functions via the use of kernels. We consider in detail the derivation of the standard support vector algorithms for regression estimation and, as an example for a recently reported extension to the standard algorithms, describe the \u03bd-SVM which is capable of tuning one of the parameters involved in support vector training as a part of the training procedure. Then, the connection between maximum likelihood estimation and the choice of the loss function is established, and the introduction of kernels allows us to show how SVMs are related to other function estimation approaches. We finish the first part with a discussion on the important question of how the hyperparameters involved in the support vector algorithms can be assessed. The second part considers the application of SVMs to chaotic time series prediction. The properties of chaos as a feature of nonlinear deterministic dynamical system are reviewed, and it is discussed how observed chaotic data can be analysed via phase space reconstruction and time delay embedding. Practical methods for time delay embedding are reviewed, and we show how SVMs can be applied to the function approximation problem arising from the task of predicting chaotic time series from embedded data. In the third part, the prediction procedure with SVMs is described in detail. The setup of the numerical experiments and an analysis of the time series considered therein are given. We report and illustrate new results for chaotic time series prediction on the Henon time series, the Mackey-Glass time series, the Lorenz time series and the Santa Fe data set A, obtained with SVMs as global and local models employing different kernel functions.

Therefore, obtaining the CCT is still an interesting topic for investigation. This paper proposes a new technique for obtaining CCT based on numerical calculations and artificial intelligence techniques. First, the CCT is calculated by the critical trajectory method based on critical generation. Second, the CCT is learned by Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). This proposed method has the ability to obtain the CCT with load changes, different fault occurrences, accuracy, and fast computation, and considering the controller. This proposed method is tested by the IEEE 3-machine 9-bus system and Java-Bali 500 kV 54-machine 25-bus system. The proposed method can provide accurate CCTs with an average error of 0.33% for the Neural Network (NN) method and an average error of 0.06% for the ELM method. The simulation result also shows that this method is a robust algorithm that can address several load changes and different locations of faults occurring.

Regularized LDA (RLDA) provides a simple strategy to overcome the singularity problem by applying a regularization term, which is commonly estimated via cross-validation from a set of candidates. However, cross-validation may be computationally prohibitive when the candidate set is large. An efficient algorithm for RLDA is presented that computes the optimal transformation of RLDA for a large set of parameter candidates, with approximately the same cost as running RLDA a small number of times. Thus it facilitates efficient model selection for RLDA.An intrinsic relationship between RLDA and Uncorrelated LDA (ULDA), which was recently proposed for dimension reduction and classification is presented. More specifically, RLDA is shown to approach ULDA when the regularization value tends to zero. That is, RLDA without any regularization is equivalent to ULDA. It can be further shown that ULDA maps all data points from the same class to a common point, under a mild condition which has been shown to hold for many high-dimensional datasets. This leads to the overfitting problem in ULDA, which has been observed in several applications. Thetheoretical analysis presented provides further justification for the use of regularization in RLDA. Extensive experiments confirm the claimed theoretical estimate of efficiency. Experiments also show that, for a properly chosen regularization parameter, RLDA performs favorably in classification, in comparison with ULDA, as well as other existing LDA-based algorithms and Support Vector Machines (SVM).", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/1183614.1183691", "venue": "CIKM '06", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1978786559", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7036341", "124794109", "27272259", "119479891", "5839445", "2198160", "115981574", "5268653", "123458043", "1352566", "872270", "18439686", "117339117", "13602362", "8473401", "1069019", "64543020", "28637672", "121858740", "566237", "12383539", "9600286", "8406472"], "inbound_citations": ["3895263", "21723100", "15753148", "54081634", "16532443", "35692781", "53440612", "15880277", "13630063", "10765413", "14114424", "17859410", "115102483", "121565432", "20654027", "215041976", "21615840", "15944728", "14124239", "964044", "3079123", "11202038", "15048776", "12982906", "206688766", "17618932", "14269174", "17903305", "42413779", "215168875", "3456590", "28847275", "850859", "26282378", "597446", "11799589"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2694445"}

Language of uttered speech can easily be identified by extracting the language specific information from it. Identification of language of speech is known as Language Identification (LID). Identification of language from speech is helpful in its translation, speech recognition and speech activated automatic systems. LID system may also play an important role in speaker recognition as identification of language can be used to reduce search space. In this paper an approach based on Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) features for language identification is proposed using SVM and Random Forest (RF) classification techniques. Both LPC and MFCC features are vocal tract features. LPC and MFCC features extracted from uttered speech contain language as well as speaker related informations. Identification of language highly depends upon extraction of language specific features. Both these vocal tract parameters of speech contain lot of information about languages spoken compared to other parameters like excitation source parameters and prosodic parameters. Hence combination of these features performs better than individual. Experiments have been performed on the database obtained from IIIT-Hyderabad consisting of 5000 multilingual clean speech signals (Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Tamil, Marathi and Malayalam). For training the proposed model, 600 speech signals are taken arbitrarily from the above database. Language model are created for each language. Evaluation of the proposed models has been made using other 300 speech signals from same database. Language models are evaluated using individual features as well as combined features. Experiments performed by taking both features at a time give better result as compared to taking individual features one at a time. Using these features, the accuracy of language identification is not more than 80% so far as claimed by other researchers.

A seizure can be described as a brief, interim disturbance in the electrical activity of the brain and the cause of its occurrence is the quick firing of many nerve cells in the brain, causing an electrical storm. Almost 50 million people worldwide have epilepsy and its studies often rely on EEG signals for analyzing brains behavior during the occurrence of seizure. Many kinds of research around the world is carried out over past few years to analyze EEG signals automatically to detect epilepsy and type of seizure present. This paper presents classification of EEG signals into healthy/inter-ictal versus ictal EEGs using EMD based fuzzy entropy method and SVM classifier. In EMD, decomposition of the EEG signal from different epileptic states takes place to obtain IMFs. Fuzzy entropy reduces the detection time by reducing the data size of the EEG data without any loss of the information. So here EMD is followed by the calculation of FuzzyEn of the reconstructed signal obtained from IMFs. Finally, feature vectors are formed using fuzzy entropy that are applied to non-linear SVM classifier for classification purpose.

Those that have been conducted focused on using classification performance (e.g., Inception Score) and statistical metrics (e.g., Frechet Inception Distance). , Here, we consider a fundamental way to evaluate GANs by directly analyzing the images they generate, instead of using them as inputs to other classifiers. We characterize the performance of a GAN as an image generator according to three aspects: 1) Creativity: non-duplication of the real images. 2) Inheritance: generated images should have the same style, which retains key features of the real images. 3) Diversity: generated images are different from each other. A GAN should not generate a few different images repeatedly. Based on the three aspects of ideal GANs, we have designed two measures: Creativity-Inheritance-Diversity (CID) index and Likeness Score (LS) to evaluate GAN performance, and have applied them to evaluate three typical GANs. We compared our proposed measures with three commonly used GAN evaluation methods: Inception Score (IS), Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and 1-Nearest Neighbor classifier (1NNC).

The framework includes modules of probability fitting, Random Forest, a cluster-based time-domain analysis, and a visualization toolset. A case study is discussed based on the usage data from Mobike, one of the largest operating bike-sharing systems in Shanghai (China). The daily usage dynamics is modeled using log-normal distributions. Random Forest is adopted to explore the impact of factors on the usage frequency in different districts. It is found that residential area, park & green area, and population size are the top three factors influencing the frequency. Particularly, usage near metro stations is delved using the hierarchical clustering method, resulting in three typical usage modes. Visualization analysis is demonstrated to understand the time-varying flow patterns and the spatial distribution of shared bikes.

A relational analysis of features that discriminate its species and contribute to niche adaptation and survival remains to be fully described.

Three well-defined multi-species groups were identified: group A (including aureus/epidermidis); group B (including saprophyticus/xylosus) and group C (including pseudintermedius/delphini). The machine learning algorithm Random Forest was applied to prioritise orthologues that drive formation of the Staphylococcus species groups A-C. Orthologues driving staphylococcal intrageneric diversity comprised regulatory, metabolic and antimicrobial resistance proteins. Notably, the BraSR (NsaRS) two-component system (TCS) and its associated BraDE transporters that regulate antimicrobial resistance showed limited distribution in the genus and their presence was most closely associated with a subset of Staphylococcus species dominated by those that colonise human skin. Divergence of BraSR and GraSR antimicrobial peptide survival TCS and their associated transporters was observed across the staphylococci, likely reflecting niche specific evolution of these TCS/transporters and their specificities for AMPs. Experimental evolution, with selection for resistance to the lantibiotic nisin, revealed multiple routes to resistance and differences in the selection outcomes of the BraSR-positive species S. hominis and S. aureus. Selection supported a role for GraSR in nisin survival responses of the BraSR-negative species S. saprophyticus.

Horizontal stirred mills, such as the IsaMill, are designed for more efficient ultrafine grinding and have made significant inroads in the mineral processing industries since their introduction more than a decade ago. Despite their energy efficiency, significant improvement is possible via more efficient control of these mills. Advanced control generally requires online information on the key performance variables of the mill. In this regard, measurement of the particle size in the mill is problematic. However, this problem can be addressed by use of soft sensors, whereby the particle size can be estimated from the measurements of other process variables. In this investigation, such a soft sensor is developed for online estimation of particle size on an industrial IsaMill in Western Australia. The sensor consists of a random forest model that uses operational variables measured online as predictors to estimate the P80 particle size of the mill. Principal component analysis is used in conjunction with the random forest to enable it to assess the similarity of new process measurements to the data in its training data base.

Highlights include significant contributions towards solving the classical figure-ground problem for biological vision, the motor equivalence problem for flexible arm movement control including tool use, the problem of self-organizing body-centered spatial representations for movement planning and spatial orientation, and the problem of carrying out fast visual search for targets among multiple distractors. New research directions include projects which have been developed to frontally attack core problems concerning how a rapidly moving agent can self-organize spatial representations, use these representations for real-time movement planning, and transform spatial movement plans into appropriate motor commands for movement control and real-time navigation. Specific projects include retinal image processing, Formation of egocentric maps of object positions from optic flow, detection of moving objects from optic flow, integration of egocentric and allocentric representations for autonomous navigation investigation of spatial reference frames and transformations between frames for real-time flexible speech articulator control.", "year": 1994, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1578033925", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54102144"}

In recent years gene expression data have been successfully used to complement the clinical and histological criteria traditionally used in such prediction. Many \u201cgene expression signatures\u201d have been developed, i.e. sets of genes whose expression values in a tumor can be used to predict the outcome of the pathology. Here we investigate the use of several machine learning techniques to classify breast cancer patients using one of such signatures, the well established 70-gene signature. We show that Genetic Programming performs significantly better than Support Vector Machines, Multilayered Perceptron and Random Forest in classifying patients from the NKI breast cancer dataset, and slightly better than the scoring-based method originally proposed by the authors of the seventy-gene signature. Furthermore, Genetic Programming is able to perform an automatic feature selection. Since the performance of Genetic Programming is likely to be improvable compared to the out-of-the-box approach used here, and given the biological insight potentially provided by the Genetic Programming solutions, we conclude that Genetic Programming methods are worth further investigation as a tool for cancer patient classification based on gene expression data.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-12211-8_10", "venue": "EvoBIO", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2921714499,1513144067", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["15533213", "18918573"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:45606996"}

The goal is to spatially locate an arbitrarily shaped object. In many applications, it is desirable to minimize the number of measurements collected while ensuring sufficient localization accuracy. In surgery, for example, collecting a large number of localization measurements may either extend the time required to perform a surgical procedure or increase the radiation dosage to which a patient is exposed.Localization accuracy is a function of the spatial distribution of discrete measurements over an object when measurement noise is present. In previous work (J. of Image Guided Surgery, Simon et al., 1995), metrics were presented to evaluate the information available from a set of discrete object measurements. In this study, new approaches to the discrete point data selection problem are described. These include hillclimbing, genetic algorithms (GAs), and Population-Based Incremental Learning (PBIL). Extensions of the standard GA and PBIL methods that employ multiple parallel populations are explored. The results of extensive empirical testing are provided. The results suggest that a combination of PBIL and hillclimbing result in the best overall performance.

Here we show that reading profiles can be reliably identified based on Random Forest classification of incomplete behavioral datasets, after the missForest method is used to multiply impute missing values. Results from simulation analyses showed that reading profiles could be accurately classified across degrees of missingness (e.g., ~5% classification error for 30% missingness across the sample). The application of missForest to a real multi-site dataset (n = 924) showed that reading disability profiles significantly and consistently differed in reading and cognitive abilities for cases with and without missing data. The results of validation analyses indicated that the reading profiles (cases with and without missing data) exhibited significant differences for an independent set of behavioral variables that were not used to classify reading profiles.

Detecting the early indicators of dementia before it gets worsen and warning the caregivers and medical doctors would be helpful for further diagnosis. In this paper, the problem of activity recognition and abnormal behaviour detection is investigated for elderly people with dementia. First of all, the paper presents a methodology for generating synthetic data reflecting on some behavioural difficulties of people with dementia given the difficulty of obtaining real-world data. Secondly, the paper explores Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to model patterns in activity sequences and detect abnormal behaviour related to dementia. Activity recognition is considered as a sequence labelling problem, while abnormal behaviour is flagged based on the deviation from normal patterns. Moreover, the performance of CNNs is compared against the state-of-art methods such as Naive Bayes (NB), Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Hidden Semi-Markov Models (HSMM), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs).

The knowledge representation of NN is unreadable and this black box property restricts the application of NN to areas which needs proper explanations. Meanwhile CBR suffers from the feature-weighting problem, when CBR measures the distance between cases, some input features should be treated more importantly than others. This paper, we propose a hybrid prediction system of extreme learning machine (ELM) and Case-based reasoning (ELM-CBR). In our hybrid system, the feature weight set calculated from the trained ELM network plays the core role in connecting both the learning strategies, and the explanation on prediction can be given by presenting the most similar cases from the case base.

It is widely agreed that there is an increasingly urgent need for technologies which can integrate these disparate knowledge sources. In this paper we propose that not only is machine learning a good candidate technology for such data integration, but Inductive Logic Programming, in particular, has strengths for handling the relational aspects of this task. Relations can be used to capture, in a single representation, not only biochemical reaction information but also protein and ligand structure as well as metabolic network information. Resources such as the Gene Ontology (GO) and the Enzyme Commission (EC) system both provide isa-hierarchies of enzyme functions. On the face of it GO and EC should be invaluable resources for supporting automation within Functional Genomics, which aims at predicting the function of unassigned enzymes from the genome projects. However, neither GO nor EC can be directly used for this purpose since the classes have only a natural language description. In this paper we make an initial attempt at machine learning EC classes for the purpose of enzyme function prediction in terms of biochemical reaction descriptions found in the LIGAND database. To our knowledge this is the first attempt to do so. In our experiments we learn descriptions for a small set of EC classes including Oxireductase and Phosphotransferase.

Automated end-product assessment can be carried out by performance classifiers built from a set of expert performances. When applied to temporal bone surgery simulation, these classifiers can evaluate performance on the bone specimen they were trained on, but they cannot be extended to new specimens. Thus, new expert performances need to be recorded for each new specimen, requiring considerable time commitment from time-poor expert surgeons. To eliminate this need, we propose a transfer learning framework to adapt a classifier built on a single temporal bone specimen to multiple specimens. Once a classifier is trained, we translate each new specimens' features to the original feature space, which allows us to carry out performance evaluation on different specimens using the same classifier. In our experiment, we built a surgical end-product performance classifier from 16 expert trials on a simulated temporal bone specimen. We applied the transfer learning approach to 8 new specimens to obtain machine generated end-products. We also collected end-products for these 8 specimens drilled by a single expert. We then compared the machine generated end-products to those drilled by the expert.

As XML has become a de-facto standard for exchanging Web data, an interesting and practical research problem is the development of models and techniques to satisfy various needs and preferences in searching XML data. In this paper, we employ a list of simple XML tagged keywords as a vehicle for searching XML fragments in a collection of XML documents. In order to deal with the diversified nature of XML documents as well as user preferences, we propose a novel multi-ranker model (MRM), which is able to abstract a spectrum of important XML properties and adapt the features to different XML search needs. The MRM is composed of three ranking levels. The lowest level consists of two categories of similarity and granularity features. At the intermediate level, we define four tailored XML rankers (XRs), which consist of different lower level features and have different strengths in searching XML fragments. The XRs are trained via a learning mechanism called the Ranking Support Vector Machine in a voting Spy Naive Bayes framework (RSSF). The RSSF takes as input a set of labeled fragments and feature vectors and generates as output Adaptive Rankers (ARs) in the learning process. The ARs are defined over the XRs and generated at the top level of the MRM. We show empirically that the RSSF is able to improve the MRM significantly in the learning process that needs only a small set of training XML fragments. We demonstrate that the trained MRM is able to bring out the strengths of the XRs in order to adapt different preferences and queries.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s00778-007-0068-8", "venue": "The VLDB Journal", "journal": "The VLDB Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1975271527", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10872113", "5264324", "3231787", "158674", "17300151", "3077937", "7635678", "15513083", "14652609", "6274289", "7242590", "8405204", "16632383", "5652110", "52809432", "9505205", "209928701", "207605508", "53249246", "5700664", "8603568", "527125", "41177712", "26945495", "7311285", "18772942", "1508503", "3262314", "1768561", "6663623", "9997507", "3436602", "21035084", "16575407"], "inbound_citations": ["15668065", "18846204"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14462095"}

In this paper a decision support system to solve the problem of hen allocation to hen houses with the aim of minimizing the total cost is described. The total cost consists of farm utilization cost, hen transportation cost, and loss from mixing hens at different ages in the same hen houses. Clustering of hen houses using the traditional Growing Neural Gas (GNG) was first determined to allocate hens to the hen houses effectively. However, the traditional GNG often solves the clustering problem by considering distance only. Therefore the hybrid Growing Neural Gas (hGNG) considering both the distance from the centroids of the clusters to the hen houses and the weights of hen house sizes was proposed to solve the problem. In the second phase, allocating and determining routes to allocate hens to the hen houses using the nearest neighbor approach were carried out in order to minimize the total distance. The performance of the algorithm was measured using the relative improvement (RI), which compares the total costs of the hGNG and GNG algorithms and the current practice. The results obtained from this study show that the hGNG algorithm provides better total cost values than the firm's current practice from 7.92% to 20.83%, and from 5.90% to 17.91% better than the traditional GNG algorithm.

We extend this literature by using SVM during direct face processing. Individuals with SAD (n=47) and healthy controls (n=46) completed a validated emotional face matching task during functional MRI, which included a matching shapes control condition. SVM was based on brain response to threat (vs. happy) faces, threat faces (vs. shapes), and threat/happy faces (vs. shapes) in 90 regions encompassing frontal, limbic, parietal, temporal, and occipital systems. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) was used for feature selection and to rank the contribution of regions in predicting SAD diagnosis. SVM results for threat (vs. happy) faces revealed satisfactory accuracy (e.g., area under the curve=0.72); results with shapes as \"baseline\" yielded less optimal classification. RFE for threat (vs. happy) indicated that all 90 brain regions were necessary for classification. RFE-based ranking suggested diffuse neurofunctional activation to threat (vs. happy) faces in classification. When using an RFE cut-point, regions implicated in sensory and goal-directed processes contributed relatively more in differentiating SAD from controls than other regions.

The main challenge has been the fragmented nature of the often outdated detailed soil maps and small-scale less-informative country-wide soil maps. Recent advances in information and computational technology have created vast potential to collect, map, harness, communicate and update soil information. These advances present favorable conditions to support the already popular shift from qualitative (conventional) to quantitative (digital) soil mapping (DSM). In this study, two decision tree machine learning algorithms, J48 and Random Forest (RF), were applied to digitally predict k-means numerically classified soil clusters to update a soil map produced in 1959. Predictors were derived from 1 arc SRTM digital elevation data and a 5 m RapidEye satellite image. J48 and RF predicted the soil units of the legacy maps with greater detail. However, RF showed superiority for predicting clusters J48 could not predict and for showing higher pixel contiguity. No significant difference (P = 0.05) was observed between the soil properties of the predicted soil clusters and the actual field validation points.

Our current work aims to further prevent forgetting by encouraging the generator to accurately generate features important for task retention. More specifically, the generator is improved by introducing a second discriminator into the Generative Adversarial Network which learns to classify between real and fake items from the intermediate activation patterns that they produce when fed through a continual learning agent. Using Atari 2600 games, we experimentally find that improving the generator can considerably reduce catastrophic forgetting compared to the standard pseudo-rehearsal methods used in deep reinforcement learning.

MDP clusters metadata patterns at drift points and uses recurring patterns to encourage drift detection where metadata looks similar to past drift points and/or discourage drift detection where metadata looks different from past drift points. It avoids relying on statistical assumptions of underlying drift patterns.

FAEs have gained importance in biofuel, medicine and food industries due to their capability of acting on a large range of substrates for cleaving ester bonds and synthesizing high-added value molecules through esterification and transesterification reactions. During the past two decades extensive studies have been carried out on the production and partial characterization of FAEs from fungi, while much less is known about FAEs of bacterial or plant origin. Initial classification studies on FAEs were restricted on sequence similarity and substrate specificity on just four model substrates and considered only a handful of FAEs belonging to the fungal kingdom. Our study centers on the descriptor-based classification and structural analysis of experimentally verified and putative FAEs. Support Vector Machine model was constructed for the classification of 365 FAEs into the pre-assigned clusters and the model successfully recognized 98.2% of the training sequences and all the sequences of the blind test. The underlying functionality of the 12 proposed FAE families was validated against a combination of prediction tools and published experimental data. Another important aspect of the present work involves the development of pharmacophore models for the new FAE families, for which sufficient information on known substrates existed. The development of pharmacophore models for specific FAE sub-families will have a huge impact on the application of members of the particular group to completely novel and unexpected substrates. Virtual screening with the developed pharmacophores of chemical and natural compound databases could reveal unique opportunities for FAEs-based-biocatalytic modifications to synthesize compounds with altered or improved medicinal properties. ::: We expressed three enzymes representing different novel FEF families in Pichia pastoris and probed their specificity profiles. Structural and functional features of expressed FEF members were probed using Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and Molecular simulations were done to understand the structural-function relationships of the FAEs for engineering studies. The active site residues were detected for the three expressed FAEs based on titration curves of amino acid residues as a function of pH obtained through simulation systems.

The proposed methodology uses Sea Surface Temperature and Chlorophyll-a estimations from AQUA and ENVISAT satellite sensors for the period 2003-2011 to predict the dissolved oxygen content in the Dutch coastal waters. It does so by implementing various Machine Learning models, namely Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network and Gradient Boosting Regressors, with the latter demonstrating the best results. After extensive data pre-processing, the results show that dissolved oxygen can be predicted with an average Root-Mean-Squared error of 0.8 g/m3. Important steps towards a lower error include the use of gap-filled variables and their decomposition into their temporal components as inputs for the model. Furthermore, the effect of the Sea Surface Temperature on the dissolved oxygen is documented through its contribution in the estimation of the latter\u2019s seasonal variability, while the estimation of the maximum dissolved oxygen values is attributed to Chlorophyll-a. Further feature engineering and model development can possibly improve the estimation of the minimum dissolved oxygen values in the coast and the overall prediction in more complex intertidal areas, like the Wadden Sea.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2963690538", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199864453"}

These features drive a supervised whole-brain and tumor segmentation approach based on random forest-derived probabilities. The asymmetry-related features (based on optimal symmetric multimodal templates) demonstrate excellent discriminative properties within this framework.

The project has received extensive systematic geochemical soil sampling in addition to high resolution airborne geophysical coverage. This data-rich environment enables experimentation with machine learning strategies which aim to produce or refine geological maps from limited direct observations. In this study we present a series of three case studies that test lithological classification using the supervised Random Forests algorithm. These studies inform the situations encountered in mineral exploration including early stage lithology mapping and more mature stage map refinement. We also present a fourth study, using the unsupervised algorithms k-means and Self-Organising Maps, to identify clusters, potentially associated with lithology in absence of a priori geological information. Our case studies are most relevant to the situation where the geology of a prospect is largely concealed beneath extensive cover rocks, with some rock types being poorly expressed or even absent in outcrop. We find that sampling from limited outcrop produces a RF lithology prediction that is likely to be incorrect. We demonstrate that balancing sample size through a combination of decimation and bootstrapping can improve results. Additionally, we identify some important indicators in both the predicted geology and uncertainty metrics which could alert an explorer to an inability of their training data to make accurate predictions and to the presence of lithological classes not expressed in outcrop. Sampling from a mature lithology map enables further map refinement and acts as an objective audit of the existing product. Information entropy (H) is calculated as a metric to describe quantitatively the uncertainty associated with classification, provide valuable information on the geological complexity of the mapped region and highlight areas which are potentially misclassified. Clusters obtained using the k-means algorithm produced a result more consistent with lithology in this instance and was faster; however Self Organising Maps remains attractive due to the production of additional metrics to assess algorithm performance.

In this paper, Manifold Learning and Gestalt Psychology Theory are involved to solve the problem of incompatibility. A new holistic descriptor called Perceptual Uniform Descriptor (PUD) based on Gestalt psychology is proposed, which combines color and gradient direction to imitate human visual uniformity. PUD features in the same class images distributes on one manifold in most cases, as PUD improves the visual uniformity of the traditional descriptors. Thus, we use manifold ranking and PUD to realize image retrieval. Experiments were carried out on four benchmark data sets, and the proposed method is shown to greatly improve the accuracy of image retrieval. Our experimental results in Ukbench and Corel-1K datasets demonstrate that N-S score reached 3.58 (HSV 3.4) and mAP at 81.77% (ODBTC 77.9%) respectively by utilizing PUD which has only 280 dimensions.

Design of decoupling algorithms is a challenging topic due to the uncertainty of coupling errors. The conventional nonlinear decoupling algorithms by a standard Neural Network (NN) are sometimes unstable due to overfitting. In order to avoid overfitting and minimize the negative effect of random noises and gross errors in calibration data, we propose a novel nonlinear static decoupling algorithm based on the establishment of a coupling error model. Instead of regarding the whole system as a black box in conventional algorithm, the coupling error model is designed by the principle of coupling errors, in which the nonlinear relationships between forces and coupling errors in each dimension are calculated separately. Six separate Support Vector Regressions (SVRs) are employed for their ability to perform adaptive, nonlinear data fitting. The decoupling performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the conventional method by utilizing obtained data from the static calibration experiment of a 3-axis force sensor.

Traditionally, single models have been introduced to predict the future value of river flow. However, single models may not be suitable to capture the nonlinear and non-stationary nature of the data. In this study, a three-step-prediction method based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) and Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) model, referred to as EMD-KPCA-LSSVM is introduced. EMD is used to decompose the river flow data into several Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and residue. Then, KPCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, which are then input into LSSVM for forecasting purposes. This study also presents comparison between the proposed model of EMD-KPCA-LSSVM with EMD-PCA-LSSVM, EMD-LSSVM, Benchmark EMD-LSSVM model proposed by previous researchers and few other benchmark models such as Single LSSVM and Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, EMD-SVM, PCA-LSSVM, and PCA-SVM. These models are ranked based on five statistical measures namely Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Correlation Coefficient ( r ), Correlation of Efficiency (CE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Then, the best ranked model is measured using Mean of Forecasting Error (MFE) to determine its under and over-predicted forecast rate. The results show that EMD-KPCA-LSSVM ranked first based on five measures for Muda, Selangor and Tualang Rivers. This model also indicates a small percentage of under-predicted values compared to the observed river flow values of 1.36%, 0.66%, 4.8% and 2.32% for Muda, Bernam, Selangor and Tualang Rivers, respectively.

However, one main limitation of this technology is the aging, i.e., the degradation of storage capacity. This degradation happens in every condition, whether the battery is used or not, but in different proportions dependent on the usage and external conditions. Due to the complexity of aging phenomena to characterize, lifetime modeling and state of health (SoH) prediction of Li-ion cells attract the attention of researchers in recent years. This paper investigates the use of incremental capacity analysis (ICA) method to estimate the SoH for NCA lithium-ion batteries. To find the IC curves, it is essential to calculate the dQ/dV of the V-Q curves of the battery, which is infeasible due to the presence of noise and sampling intervals in the voltage measurements. Therefore, a simple and robust smoothing method is proposed, based on support vector regression (SVR), to fit a continuous function to the noisy voltage curves of the battery. By differentiating the fitted function, it is shown that the peak values of the IC curves can predict the SoH of the batteries cycled with different temperature, current rate, and state of charge. More than five hundred Q-V curves from testing 22 different cells in 8 different testing conditions are investigated. An average error of 1.86% for the SoH prediction shows that the developed SoH estimator is able to robustly predict the SoH of the cells cycled under different conditions. This technique can use partial charging voltage curves, and therefore testing time can be largely reduced, making it possible to be implemented in the battery management system (BMS).", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/PTC.2019.8810665", "venue": "2019 IEEE Milan PowerTech", "journal": "2019 IEEE Milan PowerTech", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2970804214", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["108958807", "113532796", "56176269", "116378691", "110128988", "109086026", "111076476", "111346102", "115593961", "116843689", "823263", "114524669", "117293901", "109657312", "15480929"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201742079"}

In order to improve the ability to deal with large datasets, a local method of LSSVM has been developed, where only the neighboring sampling points around the one to be estimated are used for computation. A numerical test indicated that LSSVM is more accurate than the classical smoothing methods including TPS and kriging, and its error surfaces are more evenly distributed. The real-world example of smoothing noise inherent in lidar-derived DEMs also showed that LSSVM has a positive smoothing effect, which is approximately as accurate as TPS.

The success of the deep learning process is based on the training of the model for a sufficient amount of and with a high quality, diverse and large-scale data set. When the training process lacks dataset in terms of quality, variety and quantity, Transfer Learning emerges as an effective solution from Deep Learning methods. In Transfer Learning, an untrained model benefits from a previously trained model and its dataset. Base function is defined to transfer the parameters from the trained model to the untrained model. Hence, it would increase the success of deep learning model on Image Steganalysis.

A mathematical model is proposed in this paper through which effectiveness of attributes for SVM model can be calculated. The validity of this SVM model is justified by comparing the effectiveness of a SVM model with the rate of pattern recognition for corresponding SVM model. Linear, Radial Basis Function (RBF), Polynomial Kernel SVM algorithms are used for pattern recognition. The percentage of accuracy of pattern recognition increases with the effectiveness of SVM model. The range of value of effectiveness of SVM model is 0 to <x. We have tested our proposed algorithm for noninvasive Brain Computer Interface (BCI) system. The proposed mathematical model is applicable for any other linear or nonlinear system.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICCITECHN.2016.7860223", "venue": "2016 19th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT)", "journal": "2016 19th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2589540844", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["62233349", "2443126", "6271017", "16185207", "10535316", "25250911", "17002960", "54483031"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6514345"}

Nowadays, there is no standard clinical procedure for assessing bone age and the most widely used approaches are the Greulich and Pyle and the Tanner and Whitehouse methods. Computer methods have been proposed to automatize the process; however, there is a lack of exploration about how to combine the features of the different parts of the hand, and how to take advantage of ensemble techniques for this purpose. This paper presents a study where the use of ensemble techniques for improving bone age assessment is evaluated. A new computer method was developed that extracts descriptors for each joint of each finger, which are then combined using different ensemble schemes for obtaining a final bone age value. Three popular ensemble schemes are explored in this study: bagging, stacking and voting. Best results were achieved by bagging with a rule-based regression (M5P), scoring a mean absolute error of 10.16 months. Results show that ensemble techniques improve the prediction performance of most of the evaluated regression algorithms, always achieving best or comparable to best results. Therefore, the success of the ensemble methods allow us to conclude that their use may improve computer-based bone age assessment, offering a scalable option for utilizing multiple regions of interest and combining their output.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "25012476", "doi": "10.1007/s10916-014-0087-0", "venue": "Journal of Medical Systems", "journal": "Journal of Medical Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1996708152", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["23429485", "72888893", "42950525", "10950042", "45989512", "2828353", "24215004", "1300681", "11275855", "22598366", "5526774", "15242659", "12366419", "26539354", "14028768", "62707267", "11149239", "189871814", "207738357", "61437731", "5895004", "13861754"], "inbound_citations": ["198910674", "1209034", "49275968", "148214946", "6327905", "49428358", "214999610", "210697319"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6809769"}

Circulating miRNA are found in small vesicles known as exosomes within biological fluids such as human serum. The aim of this work was to determine a set of differential exosomal miRNA biomarkers between healthy and AD patients, which may aid in diagnosis. Using next-generation deep sequencing, we profiled exosomal miRNA from serum (N=49) collected from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Flagship Study (AIBL). Sequencing results were validated using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR; N=60), with predictions performed using the Random Forest method. Additional risk factors collected during the 4.5-year AIBL Study including clinical, medical and cognitive assessments, and amyloid neuroimaging with positron emission tomography were assessed. An AD-specific 16-miRNA signature was selected and adding established risk factors including age, sex and apolipoprotein \u025b4 (APOE \u025b4) allele status to the panel of deregulated miRNA resulted in a sensitivity and specificity of 87% and 77%, respectively, for predicting AD. Furthermore, amyloid neuroimaging information for those healthy control subjects incorrectly classified with AD-suggested progression in these participants towards AD.

Despite the success made so far, the problems of intra-class diversity and inter-class similarity still remain two major challenges. To explore a possible solution to these challenges, this paper proposes a novel approach, termed duplex metric learning (DML), for image set classification. The proposed DML consists of two progressive metric learning stages with different objectives used for feature learning and image classification, respectively. The metric learning regularization is not only used to learn powerful feature representations but also well explored to train an effective classifier. At the first stage, we first train a discriminative stacked autoencoder (DSAE) by layer-wisely imposing a metric learning regularization term on the neurons in the hidden layers and meanwhile minimizing the reconstruction error to obtain new feature mappings in which similar samples are mapped closely to each other and dissimilar samples are mapped farther apart. At the second stage, we discriminatively train a classifier and simultaneously fine-tune the DSAE by optimizing a new objective function, which consists of a classification error term and a metric learning regularization term. Finally, two simple voting strategies are devised for image set classification based on the learnt classifier. In the experiments, we extensively evaluate the proposed framework for the tasks of face recognition, object recognition, and face verification on several commonly-used data sets and state-of-the-art results are achieved in comparison with existing methods.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TIP.2017.2760512", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2762381996", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["108422", "6901717", "15637053", "11843115", "1753801", "7868471", "16569745", "2814112", "1543125", "959853", "14396246", "1295016", "15981452", "4525490", "3217198", "125931353", "206592508", "14124239", "60697037", "4620251", "4523132", "4475141", "5797377", "22270920", "3046524", "678821", "15257598", "20909929", "9189303", "1872039", "7625065", "4335446", "2765391", "4303168", "17574759", "10549410", "15842125", "53082787", "21027625", "10050369", "2473565", "15179402", "3043202", "1216501", "2145760", "17217571", "2087262", "47325215", "206592766", "9388942", "17484648", "3136364", "9776222", "5764405", "42281583", "2814088", "10611748", "4711865", "852459", "4637184", "206596237", "505577", "15219783", "9898157", "38814373", "17500711", "206593949", "4300209", "6693806", "5771724", "15736175"], "inbound_citations": ["127221845", "202402603", "199452895", "51614947", "49561495", "57425487", "51715566", "52299225", "69549625", "181328914", "20158095", "23620457"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208483"}

However, due to the relatively low dosage of X-rays, accurate and efficient segmentation of murine kidneys in micro-CT imaging remains challenging. In this paper, we proposed an efficient kidney segmentation method in micro-CT images based on multi-atlas registration (MAR) and random forests (RFs). First, we constructed a probability map of kidneys by the MAR and obtained an initial shape estimation of kidneys. We acquired the transformations of MAR based on high-contrast organs and then mapped kidneys to the new micro-CT images. Second, we extracted multiple features (including intensity, texture, and context features) from the voxels with lower probabilities and fed these features to a RF classifier. The role of RF is to fine-tune kidney boundaries after MAR. Finally, combining the initial shape with high probabilities and the fine-tuning of RF, we obtained the final segmentation of kidneys. The experiments were conducted on datasets acquired by micro-CT imaging of mice with and without the administration of contrast agent (Dataset1 and Dataset2). The results demonstrated the proposed MAR-RF outperformed the level sets, statistical-atlas registration, active shape model, and other supervised learning methods, with the Dice coefficients of 0.9766 and 0.9255, and the mean surface distances of 1.25 and 0.98 mm on Dataset1 and Dataset2, respectively.

Research on RF can be classified into two categories: improving the classification accuracy and decreasing the number of trees in a forest. However, most of papers related to the performance improvement of RF have focused on improving the classification accuracy. Only some papers have focused on reducing the number of trees in a forest. In this paper, we propose a new Covariance-Based Dynamic RF algorithm, called C-DRF. Compared to the previous works, while ensuring the good-enough classification accuracy, the proposed C-DRF algorithm reduces the number of trees. Specifically, by computing the covariance between the number of trees in a forest and -measure at each iteration, the proposed algorithm determines whether to increase the number of trees composing a forest. To evaluate the performance of the proposed C-DRF algorithm, we compared the learning time, the test time, and the memory usage with the original RF algorithm under the different areas of datasets. Under the same or higher classification accuracy, it is shown that the proposed C-DRF algorithm improves the performance of the original RF algorithm by as much as 58.68% at learning time, 47.91% at test time, and 68.06% in memory usage on average.

In the proposed approach, a Random Forest (RF) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to produce a forest fire susceptibility map for the Dayu County which is located in southwest of Jiangxi Province, China. For this purpose, historic forest fires and thirteen forest fire related variables were analyzed, namely: elevation, slope angle, aspect, curvature, land use, soil cover, heat load index, normalized difference vegetation index, mean annual temperature, mean annual wind speed, mean annual rainfall, distance to river network and distance to road network. The Natural Break and the Certainty Factor method were used to classify and weight the thirteen variables, while a multicollinearity analysis was performed to determine the correlation among the variables and decide about their usability. The optimal set of variables, determined by the GA limited the number of variables into eight excluding from the analysis, aspect, land use, heat load index, distance to river network and mean annual rainfall. The performance of the forest fire models was evaluated by using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) based on the validation dataset. Overall, the RF models gave higher AUC values. Also the results showed that the proposed optimized models outperform the original models. Specifically, the optimized RF model gave the best results (0.8495), followed by the original RF (0.8169), while the optimized SVM gave lower values (0.7456) than the RF, however higher than the original SVM (0.7148) model.

Incident Information Management System (IIMS) is electronic software that stores clinical mishaps narratives in places where patients are treated. It is estimated that in one state alone over one million electronic text documents are available in IIMS. In this paper we investigate the data density available in the fields entered to notify an incident and the validity of the built in classification used by clinician to categories the incidents. Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) software was used to test the classes. Four statistical classifier based on J48, Na\u00efve Bayes (NB), Na\u00efve Bayes Multinominal (NBM) and Support Vector Machine using radial basis function (SVM_RBF) algorithms were used to validate the classes. The data pool was 10,000 clinical incidents drawn from 7 hospitals in one state in Australia. In first part of the study 1000 clinical incidents were selected to determine type and number of fields worth investigating and in the second part another 5448 clinical incidents were randomly selected to validate 13 clinical incident types. Result shows 74.6% of the cells were empty and only 23 fields had content over 70% of the time. The percentage correctly classified classes on four algorithms using categorical dataset ranged from 42 to 49%, using free-text datasets from 65% to 77% and using both datasets from 72% to 79%. Kappa statistic ranged from 0.36 to 0.4. for categorical data, from 0.61 to 0.74. for free-text and from 0.67 to 0.77 for both datasets. Similar increases in performance in the 3 experiments was noted on true positive rate, precision, F-measure and area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) scores. The study demonstrates only 14 of 73 fields in IIMS have data that is usable for machine learning experiments.

Recently, Non-Iterative Methods based on Artificial Neural Networks have been revisited in the form of Random Vector Functional-Link Networks (RVFL) and its most recent derivation, the so-called Extreme Learning Machines (ELM). In this work, we evaluate the performance and potentialities of RVFL and ELM with Moore-Penrose (RVFL and ELM) and Ridge-Regression (R-ELM and R-RVFL) methods to classify 17 different upper-limb movements through surface electromyography (sEMG) signal processing. 341 different sets of tests involving sEMG channels and features were performed for each one of the 20 subjects (ten amputees and ten non-amputees) from NINAPro database. Overall, the NIM methods presented consistent advantages of accuracy rate and time processing when compared with most traditional classifiers. Once the best setup of inputs was defined, the R-ELM presented the best accuracy rate. While results up to 80% were already reported for NINAPro data using Deep Learning techniques which are blatantly costly on a computational perspective, there is no evaluation performed in embedded platforms using this database.

For example, error is the sum of false positives and false negatives and a univariate test on error cannot make a distinction between these two sources, but a 2-variate test can. Similarly, instead of combining precision and recall in $F$ measure, we can have a 2-variate test on (precision, recall). We use Hotelling's multivariate $T^2$ test for comparing two algorithms, and when we have three or more algorithms we use the multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) followed by pairwise post hoc tests. In our experiments, we see that multivariate tests have higher power than univariate tests, that is, they can detect differences that univariate tests cannot.

Then, we introduce a neighborhood repulsed correlation metric learning (NRCML) method for facial kinship verification. Most existing metric learning-based kinship verification methods are developed with the Euclidian similarity metric, so that they are not powerful enough to measure the similarity of face samples. Since face images are usually captured in wild conditions, our NRCML method uses the correlation similarity measure, where the kin relation of facial images can be better highlighted. Moreover, since negative kinship samples are usually less than positive samples, the NRCML method automatically identifies the most discriminative negative samples in the training set to learn the distance metric so that the most discriminative encoded by negative samples can better exploited. Next, we introduce a discriminative multi-metric learning (DMML) method for kinship verification.

Our RF model not only discriminated Westlake Xihu Longjing green tea (XHLJ) from other regions with an accuracy of 97.6%, but also correctly identified green tea from surrounding regions with an accuracy of 97.9%. The geographical discrimination of tea subsequently harvested in the following years also showed good reliability. Predictive accuracies were higher than 91%. 85Rb, 24Mg, \u03b413C and 39K were the most important geographical proxies for determining geographical origin of tea with a relative contribution of 20.6%, 12.5%, 12.1% and 7.4%, respectively. This RF model showed higher classification accuracy than other commonly used chemometrics models and provides a new insight into the use of predictive models utilizing historical data for geographical authentication of agricultural products with Protected Designation of Origin (PDO).", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.foodcont.2019.106807", "venue": null, "journal": "Food Control", "mag_id": "2965016336", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201203427"}

In healthy individuals, this system is generally able to fight and clear any pathogen it encounters. Blood stream infections can be caused by several pathogens such as viruses, fungi and bacteria. Delivery of appropriate treatment requires rapid identification of the invading pathogen. The use of in situ experiments attempts to identify pathogen specific immune responses but these often lead to heterogeneous biomarkers due to the high variability in methods and materials used. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) allow using gene expression patterns to discriminate between two types of infection. Comparing gene lists from independent studies shows a high degree of inconsistency. To produce consistent gene signatures, capable of discriminating fungal from bacterial infection, SVMs using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) were employed allowing the combination of classifiers using different datasets. Employing this method demonstrated the improvement in consistency of the produced gene signatures that distinguished fungal from bacterial infections irrespective of the type of the leukocyte or the experimental setup. The produced biomarker list showed an increase in consistency of 42% when compared to single classifiers and predicted the infecting pathogen on an unseen dataset with an average accuracy of 87%. Restricting the analysis to datasets comprised of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and monocytes, showed an enrichment of genes from the lysosome pathway that was not shown when using independent classifiers. Moreover, the results suggested that the lysosome pathway is specifically induced in monocytes.

In this paper, a practical and effective method of pruning SVM classifiers is systematically developed. The kernel row vectors, with one-to-one correspondence to the SVs, are first organized into clusters. The pruning work is divided into two phases. In the first phase, orthogonal projections (OPs) are performed to find kernel row vectors that can be approximated by the others. In the second phase, the previously found vectors are removed, and crosswise propagations, which simply utilize the coefficients of OPs, are implemented within each cluster. The method circumvents the problem of explicitly discerning SVs in the high-dimensional feature space as the SVM formulation does, and does not involve local minima. With different parameters, 3000 experiments were run on the LibSVM software platform. After pruning 42% of the SVs, the average change in classification accuracy was only - 0.7%, and the average computation time for removing one SV was 0.006 of the training time. In some scenarios, over 90% of the SVs were pruned with less than 0.1% reduction in classification accuracy. The experiments demonstrate the existence of large numbers of superabundant SVs in trained SVMs, and suggest a synergistic use of training and pruning in practice.

One challenge of activity recognition is the need for collecting and annotating huge amounts of data for each new physical setting in order to be able to carry out the conventional activity discovery and recognition algorithms. This extensive initial phase of data collection and annotation results in a prolonged installation process and excessive time investment for each new space. In this paper we propose a new method of transferring learned knowledge of activities to a new physical space in order to leverage the learning process in the new environment. Our method called \"Home to Home Transfer Learning\" (HHTL) is based on using a semi EM framework and modeling activities using structural, temporal and spatial features. This method allows us to avoid the tedious task of collecting and labeling huge amounts of data in the target space, and allows for a more accelerated and more scalable deployment cycle in the real world.

The SLPA algorithm is an extended algorithm for the Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA), which makes the original algorithm transition from only exploring non-overlapping communities to overlapping communities. However, due to the randomness of its initialization phase and label update phase, the SLPA algorithm has fatal disadvantages - the instability of the partitioning results and the quality of the partition cannot be guaranteed. This paper proposes an improved algorithm for SLPA algorithm, which uses the index of degree centrality to reconstruct the initialization sequence. At the same time, we proposes a concept of contribution value to rewrite the update rule, eliminating the randomness of the phase of initialization, and updating the label value by the contribution value. Making dense areas are more compact and loose areas are more sparse in the network, and eventually achieving detection of overlapping communities.

At present, there are relatively few studies on network representation for heterogeneous information network which contains different types of nodes and link relationships. Most studies on network science are based on the homogeneous networks where nodes are objects of the same entity type and the links between nodes are also of the same type. In this paper, we propose a new network representation learning method for heterogeneous network. The core of this method contains tow parts: First, according to semantic of different meta-paths, we get weights between nodes of the same type in heterogeneous information network based on attention mechanism. And then, through biased random walk on nodes of the same type, we get node sequences which can be processed by the skip-gram model to generate representation vectors of nodes. To verify our method, we do experiments on DBLP and Aminer dataset.

This process is crucial to ::: guarantee the success of the data analysis methodologies and will be a core contribution of this ::: thesis. ::: In this work we will develop general data representation techniques in the framework of Functional ::: Data Analysis (FDA) for classification and clustering problems. In Chapter 1 we motivate ::: the problems to solve, describe the roadmap of the contributions and set up the notation of this ::: work. ::: In Chapter 2 we review some aspects concerning Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs), ::: Regularization Theory Integral Operators, Support Vector Machines and Kernel Combinations. ::: In Chapter 3 we propose a new methodology to obtain finite-dimensional representations of ::: functional data. The key idea is to consider each functional curve as a point in a general function ::: space and then project these points onto a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) with the ::: aid of Regularization theory. We will describe the projection methods, analyze its theoretical ::: properties and develop an strategy to select appropriate RKHSs to represent the functional data. ::: Following the functional data analysis approach, we develop in Chapter 4 a new procedure to ::: deal with proximity (similarity or distance) matrices in classification problems by studying the ::: connection between proximity measures and a certain class of integral operators. The idea is to ::: come up with a methodology able to estimate an integral operator whose associated kernel function, ::: evaluated at the sample, approximates the sample proximity matrix of the problem. To show the ::: broad scope of application of the methodology, we will apply it to three cases: (1) classification ::: problems where the only available information about the data is an asymmetric similarity matrix ::: (2) partially labeled classification problems and (3) classification problems where several sources ::: of information are available and can be combined to obtain the discrimination function. ::: In Chapter 5 we propose an spectral framework for information fusion when the sources of ::: information are given by a set of proximity matrices. Our approach is based on the simultaneous ::: diagonalization of the original matrices of the problem and it represents a natural way to manage ::: the redundant information involved in the fusion process.

One of the main challenges in monitoring these degradation phenomena is to adequately measure a statistically significant number of signals from each of the sources acting on the asset under test. However, in industrial environments the presence of large amplitude noise sources or the simultaneous presence of multiple PD sources may limit the acquisition of the signals and therefore the final diagnosis of the equipment status may not be the most accurate. Although different procedures and separation and identification techniques have been implemented with very good results, not having a significant number of PD pulses associated with each source can limit the effectiveness of these procedures.

The sensors were used to measure the activity and lying behavior, including the total time spent lying down, the number of lying bouts, the duration of each bout for individual cows and maximal/minimal bout duration. A total of 30 lactating Holstein dairy cows were selected based on their locomotion score (NRS \u2264 2). These cows were gait scored according to a 5-point numerical rating system (NRS) and categorized during the experiment as NRS \u2264 2, NRS = 3, NRS = 3.5. This resulted in a dataset of 549 labeled days from eleven cows in total, with approximately the same amount of lame and non-lame days. Huge differences in daily behavior between individual cows were observed. Those differences were significantly larger than the change in daily behavior caused by lameness for each cow. Therefore, it was concluded that thresholds and usage of the absolute values were not feasible to predict lameness for all cows. Hence, instead of using absolute measurements for prediction, the deviation from normal behavior was used for classification. As this deviation was in some features equally likely to differ in positive and negative direction, non-linear prediction models had to be used. In addition, single features were not informative enough to reveal lameness and thus a model combining all features for prediction was necessary. For classification, Support Vector Machines with an RBF-kernel were used. In contrast to a prediction accuracy of 65% from the model derived for absolute values, we were able to predict lameness with an accuracy of 76% using the deviation from normal behavior as features. Our results demonstrate that ALT-pedometer measurements in combination with machine learning tools have the potential to detect lameness accurately on-farm.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.applanim.2012.10.001", "venue": null, "journal": "Applied Animal Behaviour Science", "mag_id": "1978722962", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["11152191", "85518598", "9335895", "56098226", "12572741", "54175853", "64601268", "15096621", "36147466", "215647973", "211139490", "202636744", "26110580", "210877995", "58952425", "2955614", "215210719", "114854686"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:143813847"}

Each task is formulated as a structured prediction problem and modeled by a hidden conditional random field (HCRF) model.

Since it was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) before about 14 hundreds years, Quran is preserved in all imaginable ways from distortion. The rapid and huge growth of digital media and internet usage, cause a wide spread of the Quranic knowledge as well as Quranic Verses, scripts, Translations, and many other Quranic sciences in its digital formats. Some of the online sources, websites, services and social network users are introducing a less authentic Quranic content, services and applications. The ordinary user of such online resources could not detect and authenticate the provided Quranic verses. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to detect Quranic words in a text extracted from online sources. The proposed approach of detection utilizes Support Vector Machine to generate a learning model of Quranic words by training the learner on the Quranic words dataset. The generated classification model is used later to classify the words from online content. Experiments based on different features categories such as the Diacritics, and Statistical features are performed and a prototype is developed, Results show that the accuracy and other evaluation measurements achieved by the proposed approach are higher than the previous measurement in the domain.

However, interpreting predictive sequence patterns learned by gkm-SVMs can be challenging. Existing interpretation methods such as deltaSVM, in-silico mutagenesis (ISM) or SHAP either do not scale well or make limiting assumptions about the model that can produce misleading results when the gkm kernel is combined with nonlinear kernels. Here, we propose GkmExplain: a computationally efficient feature attribution method for interpreting predictive sequence patterns from gkm-SVM models that has theoretical connections to the method of Integrated Gradients. Using simulated regulatory DNA sequences, we show that GkmExplain identifies predictive patterns with high accuracy while avoiding pitfalls of deltaSVM and ISM and being orders of magnitude more computationally efficient than SHAP. By applying GkmExplain and a recently developed motif discovery method called TF-MoDISco to gkm-SVM models trained on in vivo transcription factor (TF) binding data, we recover consolidated, non-redundant TF motifs. Mutation impact scores derived using GkmExplain consistently outperform deltaSVM and ISM at identifying regulatory genetic variants from gkm-SVM models of chromatin accessibility in lymphoblastoid cell-lines. ::: ::: ::: AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION ::: Code and example notebooks to reproduce results are at https://github.com/kundajelab/gkmexplain. ::: ::: ::: SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION ::: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6612808", "pubmed_id": "31510661", "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btz322", "venue": "Bioinformatics", "journal": "Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2962038738", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["3041302", "17621858", "4345217", "91479189", "23040938", "10417280", "749967", "8340441", "11894600", "21889700", "3385018", "16747630", "205424148"], "inbound_citations": ["211840533", "202624907", "210883380"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195891022"}

In this research, we apply the ELM-based Word Embeddings to the NLP task of Text Categorization, specifically Sentiment Analysis and Sequence Labeling. The ELM-based Word Embeddings utilizes a count-based approach similar to the Global Vectors (GloVe) model, where the word-context matrix is computed then matrix factorization is applied. A comparative study is done with Word2Vec and GloVe, which are the two popular state-of-the-art models. The results show that ELM-based Word Embeddings slightly outperforms the aforementioned two methods in the Sentiment Analysis and Sequence Labeling tasks.In addition, only one hyperparameter is needed using ELM whereas several are utilized for the other methods. ELM-based Word Embeddings are comparable to the state-of-the-art methods: Word2Vec and GloVe models.

Integration through EEG-fMRI trial-by-trial coupling has been proposed as a method to combine the different data sets and achieve temporal expansion of the fMRI data (Eichele et al., 2005). To fully benefit of this type of analysis simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisitions are necessary (Debener et al., 2006). Here we address the issue of predicting the signal in one modality using information from the other modality. We use multivariate Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) regression to \u201clearn\u201d the relation between fMRI activation patterns and simultaneously acquired EEG responses in the context of a complex cognitive task entailing an auditory cue, visual mental imagery and a control visual target. We show that multivariate regression is a valuable approach for predicting evoked and induced oscillatory EEG responses from fMRI time series. Prediction of EEG from fMRI is largely influenced by the overall filtering effects of the hemodynamic response function. However, a detailed analysis of the auditory evoked responses shows that there is a small but significant contribution of single trial modulations that can be exploited for linking spatially-distributed patterns of fMRI activation to specific components of the simultaneously-recorded EEG signal.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "20691274", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.07.068", "venue": "NeuroImage", "journal": "NeuroImage", "mag_id": "2155625774", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["16762154", "25571112", "11859118", "53013764", "14690693", "14707632", "12058154", "17905978", "102334484", "18307900", "625731", "813082", "213014726", "55901205", "18118158", "16009258", "10982827", "8998642", "18001054", "8566118"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8619454"}

Such complex sequential acts are broken down into distinct motor control synergies, or muscle groups, whose activities overlap in time to generate continuous, curved movements that obey an inverse relation between curvature and speed. How are such complex movements learned through attentive imitation? Novel movements may be made as a series of distinct segments, but a practiced movement can be made smoothly, with a continuous, often bell-shaped, velocity profile. How does learning of complex movements transform reactive imitation into predictive, automatic performance? A neural model is developed which suggests how parietal and motor cortical mechanisms, such as difference vector encoding, interact with adaptively timed, predictive cerebellar learning during movement imitation and predictive performance. To initiate movement, visual attention shifts along the shape to be imitated and generates vector movement using motor cortical cells. During such an imitative movement, cerebellar Purkinje cells with a spectrum of delayed response profiles sample and learn the changing directional information and, in turn, send that learned information back to the cortex and eventually to the muscle synergies involved. If the imitative movement deviates from an attentional focus around a shape to be imitated, the visual system shifts attention, and may make an eye movement, back to the shape, thereby providing corrective directional information to the arm movement system. This imitative movement cycle repeats until the cortico-cerebellar system can accurately drive the movement based on memory alone. A cortical working memory buffer transiently stores the cerebellar output and releases it at a variable rate, allowing speed scaling of learned movements which is limited by the rate of cerebellar memory readout. Movements can be learned at variable speeds if the density of the spectrum of delayed cellular responses in the cerebellum varies with speed. Learning at slower speeds facilitates learning at faster speeds. Size can be varied after learning while keeping the movement duration constant (isochrony). Context-effects arise from the overlap of cerebellar memory outputs. The model is used to simulate key psychophysical and neural data about learning to make curved movements, including a decrease in writing time as learning progresses; generation of unimodal, bell-shaped velocity profiles for each movement synergy; size and speed scaling with preservation of the letter shape and the shapes of the velocity profiles; an inverse relation between curvature and tangential velocity; and a Two-Thirds Power Law relation between angular velocity and curvature.", "year": 2000, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "11156206", "doi": "10.1016/S0893-6080(00)00065-4", "venue": "Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society", "journal": "Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society", "mag_id": "2064192233", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["20956828", "166373", "32643128", "7488205", "60689238", "12252842", "6851482", "17430911", "17943267", "195808579", "109137453", "14288404", "6756560", "16688450", "58669763", "19100788", "11179306", "36501524", "53771270", "10217591", "12799976", "15756376", "11711621", "9418890", "131776455", "3880955", "14648543", "6027934", "40079540", "55347389", "39452294", "13219734", "215105063", "14435269", "15383460", "11066620", "2448583", "39319598", "18228365", "8101473", "23572883", "8491053", "24019476", "24212271", "214906424"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2665863"}

In this study, we use untargeted metabolomics and Drosophila melanogaster to model how diet and genotype shape the metabolome of obese phenotypes. We used 16 distinct outbred genotypes of Drosophila larvae raised on normal (ND) and high-fat (HFD) diets, to produce three distinct phenotypic classes; genotypes that stored more triglycerides on a ND relative to the HFD, genotypes that stored more triglycerides on a HFD relative to ND, and genotypes that showed no change in triglyceride storage on either of the two diets. Using untargeted metabolomics we characterized 350 metabolites: 270 with definitive chemical IDs and 80 that were chemically unidentified. Using random forests, we determined metabolites that were important in discriminating between the HFD and ND larvae as well as between the triglyceride phenotypic classes. We found that flies fed on a HFD showed evidence of an increased use of omega fatty acid oxidation pathway, an alternative to the more commonly used beta fatty acid oxidation pathway. Additionally, we observed no correlation between the triglyceride storage phenotype and free fatty acid levels (laurate, caprate, caprylate, caproate), indicating that the distinct metabolic profile of fatty acids in high-fat diet fed Drosophila larvae does not propagate into triglyceride storage differences. However, dipeptides did show moderate differences between the phenotypic classes. We fit Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) of the metabolic profiles for HFD and ND flies to characterize changes in metabolic network structure between the two diets, finding the HFD to have a greater number of edges indicating that metabolome varies more across samples on a HFD.

This way, the performance advantage that boosting provides can be obtained for monolithic SVMs, i.e., without paying in classification computational effort because many learners are needed. However, SVMs are both stable and strong, and their use for boosting requires to unstabilize and to weaken them.

For linear transformation, a two-stage distance metric learning approach was developed: first, singular value decomposition was performed to get an orthogonal space, and then a linear programming was used to solve an optimal distance metric. For nonlinear transformation, we introduced Nystrom method for kernel approximation and used the revised distance metric for its radial basis function such that the merits of both linear and non-linear transformations can be utilized. 33,1622 URLs with 62 features were collected to validate the proposed feature engineering methods. The results showed that the proposed methods significantly improved the efficiency and performance of certain classifiers, such as k-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, and neural networks. The malicious URLs\u2019 identification rate of k-Nearest Neighbor was increased from 68% to 86%, the rate of linear Support Vector Machine was increased from 58% to 81%, and the rate of Multi-Layer Perceptron was increased from 63% to 82%.

They have been widely used to represent various network systems, such as social networks, biological networks and etc. Knowledge discovery on linked data is of great importance to many real applications. One of the major challenges of learning linked data is how to effectively and efficiently extract useful information from both node attributes and links in linked data. Current studies on this topic either use selected topological statistics to represent network structures, or linearly map node attributes and network structures to a shared latent feature space. However, while approaches based on statistics may miss critical patterns in network structure, approaches based on linear mappings may not be sufficient to capture the non-linear characteristics of nodes and links. To handle the challenge, we propose, to our knowledge, the first deep learning method to learn from linked data. A restricted Boltzmann machine model named LRBM is developed for representation learning on linked data. In LRBM, we aim to extract the latent feature representation of each node from both node attributes and network structures, non-linearly map each pair of nodes to the links, and use hidden units to control the mapping. The details of how to adapt LRBM for link prediction and node classification on linked data have also been presented.

Each participant underwent a structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) examination that was pre-processed in Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8) using the standard pipeline of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies. Subsequently, we applied our multivariate feature selection algorithm, which also included an L2 norm regularization to account for the clustering nature of MRI data, and a transduction-based refinement to further control overfitting. Our approach proved to be superior to two state-of-the-art feature selection methods (i.e., mass-univariate t-Test selection and recursive feature elimination), since, following the application of transductive refinement, we obtained a lower test error rate of the final classifier. Importantly, the regions identified by our method have been previously reported to be altered in OCD patients in studies using traditional brain morphometry methods. By contrast, the discrimination patterns obtained with the t-Test and the recursive feature elimination approaches extended across fewer brain regions and included fewer voxels per cluster. These findings suggest that the feature selection method presented here provides a more comprehensive characterization of the disorder, thus yielding not only a superior identification of OCD patients on the basis of their brain anatomy, but also a discrimination map that incorporates most of the alterations previously described to be associated with the disorder.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "24556078", "doi": "10.1016/j.media.2014.01.006", "venue": "Medical image analysis", "journal": "Medical image analysis", "mag_id": "2038523955", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["3796738", "195813996", "3824255", "15425273", "52004463", "22906239", "85527517", "13637523", "22941487", "4687758", "34804224", "203880499"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6435418"}

Current practice of engine tune-up relies on the experience of the automotive engineer, and tune-up is usually done by trial-and-error method and then the vehicle engine is run on the dynamometer to show the actual engine performance. Obviously the current practice involves a large amount of time and money, and then may even fail to tune up the engine optimally because a formal performance model of the engine has not been determined yet. With an emerging technique, Support Vector Machines (SVM), the approximate performance model of a petrol vehicle engine can be determined by training the sample engine performance data acquired from the dynamometer. The number of dynamometer tests for an engine tune-up can therefore be reduced because the estimated engine performance model can replace the dynamometer tests to a certain extent. In this paper, the construction, validation and accuracy of the model are discussed. The study showed that the predicted results agree well with the actual test results.

While the application of such algorithms has been highly simplified in the last years due to their well-documented integration in commonly used statistical programming languages such as R, there are several practical challenges in the field of ecological modeling related to unbiased performance estimation, optimization of algorithms using hyperparameter tuning and spatial autocorrelation. We address these issues in the comparison of several widely used machine-learning algorithms such as Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), k-Nearest Neighbor (WKNN), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to traditional parametric algorithms such as logistic regression (GLM) and semi-parametric ones like generalized additive models (GAM). Different nested cross-validation methods including hyperparameter tuning methods are used to evaluate model performances with the aim to receive bias-reduced performance estimates. As a case study the spatial distribution of forest disease Diplodia sapinea in the Basque Country in Spain is investigated using common environmental variables such as temperature, precipitation, soil or lithology as predictors. Results show that GAM and RF (mean AUROC estimates 0.708 and 0.699) outperform all other methods in predictive accuracy. The effect of hyperparameter tuning saturates at around 50 iterations for this data set. The AUROC differences between the bias-reduced (spatial cross-validation) and overoptimistic (non-spatial cross-validation) performance estimates of the GAM and RF are 0.167 (24%) and 0.213 (30%), respectively.

Compared with current techniques for pose-invariant face recognition, which either expect pose invariance from hand-crafted features or data-driven deep learning solutions, or first normalize profile face images to frontal pose before feature extraction, we argue that it is more desirable to perform both tasks jointly to allow them to benefit from each other. To this end, we propose a Pose-Invariant Model (PIM) for face recognition in the wild, with three distinct novelties. First, PIM is a novel and unified deep architecture, containing a Face Frontalization sub-Net (FFN) and a Discriminative Learning sub-Net (DLN), which are jointly learned from end to end. Second, FFN is a well-designed dual-path Generative Adversarial Network which simultaneously perceives global structures and local details, incorporating an unsupervised cross-domain adversarial training and a meta-learning (\u201clearning to learn\u201d) strategy using siamese discriminator with dynamic convolution for high-fidelity and identity-preserving frontal view synthesis. Third, DLN is a generic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for face recognition with our enforced cross-entropy optimization strategy for learning discriminative yet generalized feature representations with large intra-class affinity and inter-class separability.

We confirm that training with aligned data results in better grounded sentence representations than training with disjoint data, as measured by image--sentence retrieval performance. In order to close this gap in performance, we propose a pseudopairing method to generate synthetically aligned English--German--image triplets from the disjoint sets. The method works by first training a model on the disjoint data, and then creating new triples across datasets using sentence similarity under the learned model.

This is largely due to limited access to overnight sleep testing using polysomnography (PSG). Our goal was to distinguish OSA from healthy individual using a simple maneuver during wakefulness in combination with machine learning methods. Methods: Participants have undergone an overnight PSG to determine their ground truth OSA severity. Separately, they were asked to breathe through a nasal mask or a mouth piece through which negative pressure (NP) was applied, during wakefulness. Airflow waveforms were acquired and several features were extracted and used to train various classifiers to predict OSA. Results and Discussion: The performance of each classifier and experimental setup was calculated. The best results were obtained using Random Forest classifier for distinguishing OSA from healthy individuals with a very good area under the curve of 0.80.

Further, in recent years, email spamming in particular has been subjected to an exponentially growing threat which affects both individuals and business world. Hence, a large number of studies have been proposed in order to combat with spam emails. In this study, instead of subject or body components of emails, pure use of hyperlink texts along with word level n-gram indexing schema is proposed for the first time in order to generate features to be employed in a spam/ham email classifier. Since the length of link texts in e-mails does not exceed sentence level, we have limited the n-gram indexing up to trigram schema. Throughout the study, provided by COMODO Inc, a novel large scale dataset covering 50.000 link texts belonging to spam and ham emails has been used for feature extraction and performance evaluation. In order to generate the required vocabularies; unigrams, bigrams and trigrams models have been generated. Next, including one active learner, three different machine learning methods (Support Vector Machines, SVM-Pegasos and Naive Bayes) have been employed to classify each link. According to the results of the experiments, classification using trigram based bag-of-words representation reaches up to 98,75% accuracy which outperforms unigram and bigram schemas.

Given the matched (positive) and unmatched (negative) image pairs from source domain cameras, as well as unmatched (negative) image pairs which can be easily generated from target domain cameras, we propose a Domain Transfer Ranked Support Vector Machines (DTRSVM) method for re-identification under target domain cameras. To overcome the problems introduced due to the absence of matched (positive) image pairs in target domain, we relax the discriminative constraint to a necessary condition only relying on the positive mean in target domain. By estimating the target positive mean using source and target domain data, a new discriminative model with high confidence in target positive mean and low confidence in target negative image pairs is developed.

With machine learning algorithms, it is possible to develop models to be used in disease and pest warning systems as a function of the weather in order to improve the efficiency of chemical control of pests of the coffee tree. Thus, we correlated the infection rates with the weather variables and also calibrated and tested machine learning algorithms to predict the incidence of coffee rust, cercospora, coffee miner, and coffee borer. We used weather and field data obtained from coffee plantations in production in the southern regions of the State of Minas Gerais (SOMG) and from the region of the Cerrado Mineiro; these crops did not receive phytosanitary treatments. The algorithms calibrated and tested for prediction were (a) Multiple linear regression (RLM); (b) K Neighbors Regressor (KNN); (c) Random Forest Regressor (RFT), and (d) Artificial Neural Networks (MLP). As dependent variables, we considered the monthly rates of coffee rust, cercospora, coffee miner, and coffee tree borer, and the weather elements were considered as independent (predictor) variables. Pearson correlation analyses were performed considering three different time periods, 1\u201310 d (from 1 to 10 days before the incidence evaluation), 11\u201320 d, and 21\u201330 d, and used to evaluate the unit correlations between the weather variables and infection rates of coffee diseases and pests. The models were calibrated in years of high and low yields, because the biannual variation of harvest yield of coffee beans influences the severity of the diseases. The models were compared by the Willmott\u2019s \u2018d\u2019, RMSE (root mean square error), and coefficient of determination (R2) indices. The result of the more accurate algorithm was specialized for the SOMG and Cerrado Mineiro regions using the kriging method. The weather variables that showed significant correlations with coffee rust disease were maximum air temperature, number of days with relative humidity above 80%, and relative humidity. RFT was more accurate in the prediction of coffee rust, cercospora, coffee miner, and coffee borer using weather conditions. In the SOMG, RFT showed a greater accuracy in the predictions for the Cerrado Mineiro in years of high and low yields and for all diseases.

In this architecture, the sample is unclassifiable if the values of more than two decision functions are positive or all the values are negative. In this paper, to overcome this problem, we propose fuzzy support vector machines (FSVMs). Using the decision functions obtained by training the SVM, for each class, we define a truncated polyhedral pyramidal membership function.

This is a common problem faced by brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCI) and poses a challenge for systems that try to reuse data from previous recordings to avoid a calibration phase for new users or new sessions for the same user. Method: We propose a method based on Procrustes analysis for matching the statistical distributions of two datasets using simple geometrical transformations (translation, scaling, and rotation) over the data points. We use symmetric positive definite matrices (SPD) as statistical features for describing the EEG signals, so the geometrical operations on the data points respect the intrinsic geometry of the SPD manifold. Because of its geometry-aware nature, we call our method the Riemannian Procrustes analysis (RPA). We assess the improvement in transfer learning via RPA by performing classification tasks on simulated data and on eight publicly available BCI datasets covering three experimental paradigms (243 subjects in total). Results: Our results show that the classification accuracy with RPA is superior in comparison to other geometry-aware methods proposed in the literature. We also observe improvements in ensemble classification strategies when the statistics of the datasets are matched via RPA.

This limitation often results in challenges with resolving fine details and structures of the imaged sample outside of the Depth-Of-Focus (DOF) range. We propose a novel technique for generating Laterally Resolved OCT (LR-OCT) images using OCT measurements acquired with intentional imbrications.

The proposed lateral resolution enhancement method was tested on synthetic OCT measurement as well as on a human cornea SDOCT image to evaluate the usefulness of the proposed approach in lateral resolution enhancement.

In this paper, a pose invariant deeply learned multiview 3D face recognition approach is proposed and aims to address two problems: face alignment and face recognition through identification and verification setups. The proposed alignment algorithm is capable of handling frontal as well as profile face images. It employs a nose tip heuristic based pose learning approach to estimate acquisition pose of the face followed by coarse to fine nose tip alignment using L2 norm minimization. The whole face is then aligned through transformation using knowledge learned from nose tip alignment. Inspired by the intrinsic facial symmetry of the Left Half Face (LHF) and Right Half Face (RHF), Deeply learned (d) Multi-View Average Half Face (d-MVAHF) features are employed for face identification using deep convolutional neural network (dCNN). For face verification d-MVAHF-Support Vector Machine (d-MVAHF-SVM) approach is employed.

Diagnosis is limited to physical examination. The gold standard, transanal ultrasonography and manometry, can be performed after a few weeks, whereas clinical practice requires that injury be detected as early as possible for optimal treatment. Therefore, we would like to validate an alternative technique, impedance spectroscopy. The aim of the study is to analyze the accuracy of problem detection within the 3\u20131000 kHz frequency range in 3 radial positions. 22 females (10 issued and 12 included in a control group) were engaged. Impedance moduli and phase shifts were estimated using a bipolar impedance spectrometer along with a specific anal probe. We calculated parameters assessing different subranges of analyzed frequencies and treated them as input vectors for detection. Accuracies were estimated for Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Quinlay\u2019s C5.0 models. We performed recursive feature elimination to find the most significant subranges of frequencies. An accuracy of 86.4% was observed for the Random Forest technique and entire set of considered parameters.

It is a crucial tool in knowledge and content management. Standard machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Perceptron have been successfully applied to this task. However, many real-world classification problems involve large numbers of overlapping categories that are arranged in a hierarchy or taxonomy. This poses a challenge to learning algorithms as they ignore the class hierarchies thereby losing valuable information. ::: In this thesis, we propose to systematically incorporate prior knowledge on category taxonomy directly into the learning architecture. We present two methods, hierarchical SVM learning and hierarchical Perceptron learning. Both methods take a ranking view of the multilabel problem by focusing on ranking category relevances. In the hierarchical SVM, the hierarchical learning problem is expressed as a joint large margin formulation that simultaneously learns the discriminant functions of each class. As the resulting optimization problem can be prohibitively large, we also present a variable selection algorithm to efficiently solve it. In the hierarchical Perceptron method, the construction of weight vectors and the update rule are made to capture the category taxonomy. Both methods can leverage kernel techniques, work with arbitrary directed acyclic graph taxonomy, and be applied to general settings where categories can be characterized by attributes. We also present an automatic approach to learn a taxonomy if one isn't available. Our approach is adapted from the hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm. The learned hierarchy can then be used in existing hierarchical classification approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate the performance advantage of our approaches.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2128899870", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["10805202", "37867846"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:123660110"}

Past research has been focused on centralized algorithms, which assume the existence of a central data repository (database) which stores and can process the data from all participants. Such an architecture, however, can be impractical when data are not centrally located, it does not scale well to very large datasets, and introduces single-point of failure risks which could compromise the integrity and privacy of the data. Given scores of data widely spread across hospitals/individuals, a decentralized computationally scalable methodology is very much in need. Objective We aim at solving a binary supervised classification problem to predict hospitalizations for cardiac events using a distributed algorithm. We seek to develop a general decentralized optimization framework enabling multiple data holders to collaborate and converge to a common predictive model, without explicitly exchanging raw data. Methods We focus on the soft-margin l1-regularized sparse Support Vector Machine (sSVM) classifier. We develop an iterative cluster Primal Dual Splitting (cPDS) algorithm for solving the large-scale sSVM problem in a decentralized fashion. Such a distributed learning scheme is relevant for multi-institutional collaborations or peer-to-peer applications, allowing the data holders to collaborate, while keeping every participant's data private. Results We test cPDS on the problem of predicting hospitalizations due to heart diseases within a calendar year based on information in the patients Electronic Health Records prior to that year. cPDS converges faster than centralized methods at the cost of some communication between agents. It also converges faster and with less communication overhead compared to an alternative distributed algorithm. In both cases, it achieves similar prediction accuracy measured by the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of the classifier. We extract important features discovered by the algorithm that are predictive of future hospitalizations, thus providing a way to interpret the classification results and inform prevention efforts.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5836813", "pubmed_id": "29500022", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2018.01.007", "venue": "International journal of medical informatics", "journal": "International journal of medical informatics", "mag_id": "2783522756", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["208006713", "207847245", "214594497", "208513099", "174798634", "201042222", "207757221", "195750777", "212716920", "52139752", "202888951", "201042214", "204575663", "211119588", "215548987", "59599820", "196699476", "212564997", "203836975", "210859156", "84833166", "211061012", "52917224", "119721681", "201691198", "215351951", "53734015", "212704963", "182823084", "207758011", "208617717", "211296702", "211083016", "196633155", "208058234"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3679574"}

An IR system needs knowledge about the domain of discourse in order to produce effective responses to the users' queries. Several methods have been developed in order to extract useful domain knowledge such as a thesaurus knowledge structure and classification rules for the conceptual classification of documents. ::: Most of the earlier work on the acquisition of such domain knowledge, in IR literature, involves intensive human effort. Although some studies for the automatic acquisition of such knowledge have been conducted, those approaches are ad hoc and computationally expensive and do not provide a systematic way of using that knowledge. ::: In this research, we investigate methods for acquisition and use of domain knowledge employing connectionist learning which can be conveniently realized in a Connectionist Model (CM). A class of CM, known as high-order CM, is modified in such a way that meaningful high-order correlations among terms are easily used, and a large number of terms are handled efficiently during the learning process. ::: We first investigate a method of automatic acquisition of thesaurus domain-knowledge termed as pseudo-thesaurus. Instead of establishing complex semantic relationships among terms such as synonymity or generality, we determine negative/positive semantic relationships among them by connectionist learning based on accumulated users' relevance feedback. The pseudo-thesaurus is optimal and is incorporated in the retrieval process systematically. ::: Secondly, a method of deriving characterization rules for conceptual classification of documents by using connectionist learning is developed. The domain expert knowledge in the form of conceptual categories are identified by a knowledge elicitation method known as Personal Construct Theory. The construction of the characterization rule is then achieved by a learning algorithm that analyzes samples from each conceptual category. This investigation not only provides a way to improve retrieval effectiveness and efficiency by having conceptual clusters of documents but also provides a systematic way of identifying concepts present in a natural language document. ::: In addition to the investigation described above, a precision measure, which is suitable for evaluating in a predictive sense IR systems that employ some sort of learning mechanism, is also provided based on sound theoretical basis.", "year": 1991, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "74843291", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59778454"}
