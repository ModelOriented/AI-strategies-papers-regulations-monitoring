Using public EEG data, a wide range of features is extracted from each segment and then applied to the classifiers. The analysis covers a patient-specific approach, so as to optimize the decision to each patient individually and a patient-independent approach in order to explore a global prediction approach that can discriminate randomly selected preictal and interictal segments from all patients. Overall, the first approach aims at revealing patient-specific epileptic characteristics, whereas the second seeks for potential general preictal-related signs.

{"paper_id": "125228228", "title": "Belief relational clustering and its application to community detection", "authors": [{"first": "Kuang", "middle": [], "last": "Zhou", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Communities are groups of nodes (vertices) which probably share common properties and/or play similar roles within the graph. They can extract specific structures from complex networks, and consequently community detection has attracted considerable attention crossing many areas where systems are often represented as graphs. We consider in this work to represent graphs as relational data, and propose models for the corresponding relational data clustering. Four approaches are brought forward to handle the community detection problem under different scenarios. We start with a basic situation where nodes in the graph are clustered based on the dissimilarities and propose a new c-partition clustering approach named Median Evidential C-Means (MECM) algorithm. This approach extends the median clustering methods in the framework of belief function theory. Moreover, a community detection scheme based on MECM is presented. The proposed approach could provide credal partitions for data sets with only known dissimilarities. The dissimilarity measure could be neither symmetric nor fulfilling any metric requirements. It is only required to be of intuitive meaning. Thus it expands application scope of credal partitions. In order to capture various aspects of the community structures, we may need more members rather than one to be referred as the prototypes of an individual group. Motivated by this idea, a Similarity-based Multiple Prototype (SMP) community detection approach is proposed. The centrality values are used as the criterion to select multiple prototypes to characterize each community. The prototype weights are derived to describe the degree of representativeness of objects for their own communities. Then the similarity between each node and community is defined, and the nodes are partitioned into divided communities according to these similarities. Crisp and fuzzy partitions could be obtained by the application of SMP. Following, we extend SMP in the framework of belief functions to get credal partitions so that we can gain a better understanding of the data structure. The prototype weights are incorporate into the objective function of evidential clustering. The mass membership and the prototype weights could be updated alternatively during the optimization process. In this case, each cluster could be described using multiple weighted prototypes. As we will show, the prototype weights could also provide us some useful information for structure analysis of the data sets. Lastly, the original update rule and propagation criterion of LPA are extended in the framework of belief functions. A new community detection approach, called Semi-supervised Evidential Label Propagation (SELP), is proposed as an enhanced version of the conventional LPA. One of the advantages of SELP is that it could take use of the available prior knowledge about the community labels of some individuals. This is very common in real practice. In SELP, the nodes are divided into two parts. One contains the labeled nodes, and the other includes the unlabeled ones. The community labels are propagated from the labeled nodes to the unlabeled ones step by step according to the proposed evidential label propagation rule. The performance of the proposed approaches is evaluated using benchmark graph data sets and generated graphs. Our experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed clustering algorithms and community detection approaches.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2557992924", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125228228"}

We hypothesized that HRV in such children would yield a biomarker of fetal ZIKV exposure. We investigated the HRV properties of 21 infants aged 4 to 25 months from Brazil. The infants were divided in two groups, the ZIKV-exposed (n=13) and controls (n=8). Single channel ECG was recorded in each child at ~15 months of age and HRV was analyzed in 5 min segments to provide a comprehensive characterization of the degree of variability and complexity of the heart rate. Using a cubic Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier we identified babies as Zika cases or controls with negative predictive value of 92% and positive predictive value of 86%. Our results show that HRV metrics can help differentiate between ZIKV-affected, yet asymptomatic, and non-ZIKV exposed babies. We identified the Grid Count as the best HRV measure in this study allowing such differentiation, regardless the presence of microcephaly.

Great progress has been made by previous research to increase the accuracy of AED. On the front end, multiple kinds of features such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Gammatone Cepstral Coefficients (GTCCs) and many other hand-crafted features were explored. While on the back end, models or methods such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Bags-of-Audio-Words (BoAW), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and various types of neural networks were experimented. Recent researches on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC) show the advantage of using Convolutional, Long Short-Term Memory, Deep Neural Networks (CLDNNs) on audio processing tasks. In this thesis, I am building a non-linguistic vocalization recognition system using CLDNNs. Log Mel-filterbank coefficients are adopted as input features and data augmentation methods such as random shifting and noise mixture are discussed. The built system is evaluated on a custom dataset collected from several resources and tested for real time application. The performance of CLDNNs for non-linguistic vocalization recognition is also compared with hybrid GMM-SVMs, Convolutional Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory and a fully connected Deep Neural Network trained on VGGish embeddings.

The classification of an input sample is determined by the majority classification by the ensemble. Traditional random forest classifiers can be highly effective, but classification using a random forest is memory bound and not typically suitable for acceleration using FPGAs or GP-GPUs due to the need to traverse large, possibly irregular decision trees. Recent work at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has developed several variants of random forest classifiers, including the Compact Random Forest (CRF), that can generate decision trees more suitable for acceleration than traditional decision trees. Our paper compares and contrasts the effectiveness of FPGAs, GP-GPUs, and multi-core CPUs for accelerating classification using models generated by compact random forest machine learning classifiers. Taking advantage of training algorithms that can produce compact random forests composed of many, small trees rather than fewer, deep trees, we are able to regularize the forest such that the classification of any sample takes a deterministic amount of time. This optimization then allows us to execute the classifier in a pipelined or single-instruction multiple thread (SIMT) fashion. We show that FPGAs provide the highest performance solution, but require a multi-chip / multi-board system to execute even modest sized forests. GP-GPUs offer a more flexible solution with reasonably high performance that scales with forest size. Finally, multi-threading via Open MP on a shared memory system was the simplest solution and provided near linear performance that scaled with core count, but was still significantly slower than the GP-GPU and FPGA.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/FCCM.2012.47", "venue": "2012 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines", "journal": "2012 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2162741763", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["89141", "108377", "3626971", "125683267", "59849738", "1305618", "870100", "13324291"], "inbound_citations": ["21338013", "15559267", "69407387", "208947034", "202888730", "62188039", "67443261", "52569908", "202159541", "49542000", "199441108", "165863", "52166233", "192519165", "24813859", "19379133", "202734856", "189824364", "18153951", "207226159", "16488846", "2383456", "52399852", "197672307", "7274861", "3337304", "14944403", "16004657", "19702344", "53311090", "4516014", "20511466", "168992", "202565808", "59231984", "9928463", "43124873", "11477355", "8321277", "155108893", "1190459", "1647722"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1615112"}

In this work, we investigate a novel embedding approach based on the intuition that source code has visual patterns of semantics. We further use these patterns to address the outstanding challenge of identifying semantic code clones. We propose the WYSIWIM (\"What You See Is What It Means\") approach where visual representations of source code are fed into powerful pre-trained image classification neural networks from the field of computer vision to benefit from the practical advantages of transfer learning. We evaluate the proposed embedding approach on two variations of the task of semantic code clone identification: code clone detection (a binary classification problem), and code classification (a multi-classification problem).

Prominent example applications are photo realistic changes of facial features and expressions, like changing the hair color, adding a smile, enlarging the nose or altering the entire context of a scene, like transforming a summer landscape into a winter panorama. Recent advances in attribute transfer are mostly based on generative deep neural networks, using various techniques to manipulate images in the latent space of the generator. In this paper, we present a novel method for the common sub-task of local attribute transfers, where only parts of a face have to be altered in order to achieve semantic changes (e.g. removing a mustache). In contrast to previous methods, where such local changes have been implemented by generating new (global) images, we propose to formulate local attribute transfers as an inpainting problem. Removing and regenerating only parts of images, our Attribute Transfer Inpainting Generative Adversarial Network (ATI-GAN) is able to utilize local context information, resulting in visually sound results.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2002.03040", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3005438315", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["26169625", "52889459", "9417016", "17579179", "52894495", "1033682", "10894094", "10957595", "3707204", "3568073", "211022860", "8239952", "199064571", "9459250", "459456", "12803511", "203588057", "2202933", "11758569", "54444399", "53047249", "24005817", "4072789", "47017068", "1277217", "50698", "206770979"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211069239"}

Some investigations have found correlations between parameters and necessary energy for defibrillating AF, but no tool exist for predicting whether an electric shock will be successful or not in low energy IC. Thirty eight patients with AF, for elective DC cardioversion at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast, were included in our study. Two catheters were positioned in the right atrial appendage (RAA) and the coronary sinus (CS), to deliver a biphasic shock waveform, synchronized with the R wave of the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. A voltage step-up protocol (50-300 V) was used for patient cardioversion. The ECG was analyzed for an average time interval of 52,8\u00b110.1 s (corresponding to segments before each shock). Residual atrial fibrillatory signal (RAFS) was estimated by means of bandpass filtering and ventricular ac- tivity (QRST) cancellation. QRST complexes were cancelled using a recursive least squared (RLS) adaptive filter. The atrial fibrillatory frequency (AFF) and the instantaneous fre- quency (IF) series were extracted from the RAFS. AFF was calculated from whole segments and from the 10 seconds of the RAFS previous shocks. The mean, standard deviation and approximate entropy of the IF time series were computed. RR intervals of the ECG segments were also analyzed. A total of 26 patients were successfully cardioverted, employing 167 shocks (141 non successful).

Ticks have trespassed the limits of forests and grasslands to start inhabiting green spaces within metropolitan areas. Hence, the transmission of pathogens causing tick-borne diseases is an important threat to public health. Using volunteered tick bite reports collected by two Dutch initiatives, here we present a method to model tick bite risk using human exposure and tick hazard predictors. Our method represents a step forward in risk modelling, since we combine a well-known ensemble learning method, Random Forest, with four count data models of the (zero-inflated) Poisson family. This combination allows us to better model the disproportions inherent in the volunteered tick bite reports. Unlike canonical machine learning models, our method can capture the overdispersion or zero-inflation inherent in data, thus yielding tick bite risk predictions that resemble the original signal captured by volunteers. Mapping model predictions enables a visual inspection of the spatial patterns of tick bite risk in the Netherlands. The Veluwe national park and the Utrechtse Heuvelrug forest, which are large forest-urban interfaces with several cities, are areas with high tick bite risk.

The model-based approach is quite straightforward but nontrivial, since people could not always have the desired 3D query model available by side. Recently, large amounts of wide-screen electronic devices are prevail in our daily lives, which makes the sketch-based 3D shape retrieval a promising candidate due to its simpleness and efficiency. The main challenge of sketch-based approach is the huge modality gap between sketch and 3D shape. In this paper, we proposed a novel deep correlated holistic metric learning (DCHML) method to mitigate the discrepancy between sketch and 3D shape domains. The proposed DCHML trains two distinct deep neural networks (one for each domain) jointly, which learns two deep nonlinear transformations to map features from both domains into a new feature space. The proposed loss, including discriminative loss and correlation loss, aims to increase the discrimination of features within each domain as well as the correlation between different domains. In the new feature space, the discriminative loss minimizes the intra-class distance of the deep transformed features and maximizes the inter-class distance of the deep transformed features to a large margin within each domain, while the correlation loss focused on mitigating the distribution discrepancy across different domains. Different from existing deep metric learning methods only with loss at the output layer, our proposed DCHML is trained with loss at both hidden layer and output layer to further improve the performance by encouraging features in the hidden layer also with desired properties.

This requires a detailed study of the effect of environmental forces of the marine structures. This paper aims at developing an unified framework to study the effect of wind force and moments on marine vessels. A neural network approach is developed to study the effect of longitudinal and side forces of wind, and the yaw moment. The study considers various types of marine vessels at different loading conditions, with a total of 22 marine vessels. Of these, 18 are used to train an ensemble of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) neural network. The network thus developed is tested for generalization on 2 new type of vessels at 2 different loading conditions. Thus, the developed model is capable of predicting the wind force and moment coefficients, irrespective of the type of vessel used. An Ensemble of extreme learning machine, each with input parameters initialized at different regions of the input space, are trained with all training samples.

Most researchers attribute such success to the substantially increased depth of deep learning models. However, training a deep model is time-consuming and need huge amount of data. Though techniques like fine-tuning can ease those pains, the generalization performance drops significantly in transfer learning setting with little or without target domain data. Since the representation in higher layers must transition from general to specific eventually, generalization performance degrades without integrating sufficient label information of target domain. To address such problem, we propose a transfer learning framework called manifold regularized convolutional neural networks (MRCNN). Specifically, MRCNN fine-tunes a very deep convolutional neural network on source domain, and simultaneously tries to preserve the manifold structure of target domain.

We advance this line of research by proposing an enhanced Random Subspace method, POS-RS, for sentiment classification based on part-of-speech analysis.

Ten publicly available sentiment datasets were investigated to verify the effectiveness of proposed method.

However, the evaluation of these habitats is highly hindered by limitations related to both waterborne surveys (slow acquisition, shallow water and low reactivity) and water clarity (turbid for most coastal areas). Substratum type/diversity and bathymetric features were elucidated using a supervised method applied to airborne bathymetric LiDAR waveforms over Saint-Sim\u00e9on-Bonaventure's nearshore area (Gulf of Saint-Lawrence, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada). High-resolution underwater photographs were taken at three hundred stations across an 8-km(2) study area. Seven models based upon state-of-the-art machine learning techniques such as Na\u00efve Bayes, Regression Tree, Classification Tree, C 4.5, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and CN2 learners were tested for predicting eight epi-macrobenthic species diversity metrics as a function of the class number. The Random Forest outperformed other models with a three-discretized Simpson index applied to epi-macrobenthic communities, explaining 69% (Classification Accuracy) of its variability by mean bathymetry, time range and skewness derived from the LiDAR waveform. Corroborating marine ecological theory, areas with low Simpson epi-macrobenthic diversity responded to low water depths, high skewness and time range, whereas higher Simpson diversity relied upon deeper bottoms (correlated with stronger hydrodynamics) and low skewness and time range. The degree of species heterogeneity was therefore positively linked with the degree of the structural complexity of the benthic cover. This work underpins that fully exploited bathymetric LiDAR (not only bathymetrically derived by-products), coupled with proficient machine learner, is able to rapidly predict habitat characteristics at a spatial resolution relevant to epi-macrobenthos diversity, ranging from clear to turbid waters.

The ability to identify the substrate specificity of the enzyme's adenylation (A) and acyl-transferase (AT) domains is essential to rationally deduce or engineer new products. We here report on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based ensemble method to predict the substrate specificity at high quality. We collected a new reference set of experimentally validated sequences. An initial classification based on alignment and Neighbor Joining was performed in line with most of the previously published prediction methods. We then created and tested single substrate specific HMMs and found that their use improved the correct identification significantly for A as well as for AT domains. A major advantage of the use of HMMs is that it abolishes the dependency on multiple sequence alignment and residue selection that is hampering the alignment-based clustering methods. Using our models we obtained a high prediction quality for the substrate specificity of the A domains similar to two recently published tools that make use of HMMs or Support Vector Machines (NRPSsp and NRPS predictor2, respectively). Moreover, replacement of the single substrate specific HMMs by ensembles of models caused a clear increase in prediction quality. We argue that the superiority of the ensemble over the single model is caused by the way substrate specificity evolves for the studied systems. It is likely that this also holds true for other protein domains.

In this paper, we investigate the sketch-to-image synthesis problem by using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN). We propose a model called auto-painter which can automatically generate compatible colors given a sketch. Wasserstein distance is used in training cGAN to overcome model collapse and enable the model converged much better.

Feature extraction methods for sound events have been traditionally based on parametric representations specifically developed for speech signals, such as the well-known Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC). However, the discrimination capabilities of these features for Acoustic Event Classification (AEC) tasks could be enhanced by taking into account the spectro-temporal structure of acoustic event signals. In this paper, a new front-end for AEC which incorporates this specific information is proposed. It consists of two different stages: short-time feature extraction and temporal feature integration. The first module aims at providing a better spectral representation of the different acoustic events on a frame-by-frame basis, by means of the automatic selection of the optimal set of frequency bands from which cepstral-like features are extracted. The second stage is designed for capturing the most relevant temporal information in the short-time features, through the application of Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) on their periodograms computed over long audio segments. The whole front-end has been evaluated in clean and noisy conditions. Experiments show that the removal of certain frequency bands (which are mainly located in the medium region of the spectrum for clean conditions and in low frequencies for noisy environments) in the short-time feature computation process in conjunction with the NMF technique for temporal feature integration improves significantly the performance of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based AEC system with respect to the use of conventional MFCCs.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2015.10.018", "venue": "Expert Syst.

Method: We propose a novel problem formulation, DCW-DS, and an analytics-based decision support methodology to guide workers in acceptance of offered development tasks. DCS-DS is evaluated using more than one year's real-world data from TopCoder, the leading CSD platform. Results: Applying Random Forest based machine learning with dynamic updates, we can predict a worker as being a likely quitter with 99% average precision and 99% average recall accuracy. Similarly, we achieved 78% average precision and 88% average recall for the worker winner class. For workers just following the top three task recommendations, we have shown that the average quitting rate goes down below 6%.

Firstly, given the low-resolution depth image and low-resolution color image, a generative network is proposed to leverage mutual information of color image and depth image to enhance each other in consideration of the geometry structural dependency of color-depth image in the same scene. Secondly, three loss functions, including data loss, total variation loss, and 8-connected gradient difference loss are introduced to train this generative network in order to keep generated images close to the real ones, in addition to the adversarial loss. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach produces high-quality color image and depth image from low-quality image pair, and it is superior to several other leading methods.

These entities are driven by different intracellular oncogenic signaling pathways that lead to a distinct clinical outcome (Fang, Xu, & Li, 2010; Lenz et al., 2008). Several immunohistochemical (IHC)-based DLBCL classification algorithms have been proposed, this considers the case when genetic expression profile (GEP) studies are not available. However, there is a major discrepancy within IHC algorithms, and when they are compared to GEP (Coutinho et al., 2013). To address these inconsistencies and determine if an automatic classifier could be used to accurately categorize DLBCL subtype, we perfomed a present a performance comparison between eight reported IHC algorithms (Colomo, Hans, Hans modified [Hans*], Nyman, Choi, Choi modified [Choi*] and Visco-Young with three [VY3] and four [VY4] antibodies) against their counterparts developed by automatic classification techniques, which consider the following structures: Bayesian Classifier (B), Bayesian Simple Classifier (BS), Naive Bayesian Classifier (BN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The Visco-Young database (Visco et al., 2012), which contains GEP, IHC raw data corresponding to GCET1, MUM1, FOXP1, BCL6, and CD10 antibodies, and clinical information of 475 de novo DLBCL patients, was used. According to GEP, the database contained 231 GCB, and 244 non-GCB cases. Each patient in VY database was ranked by survival rate as: low survival (0 - 34 months, 237 patients), medium survival (35 - 69 months, 173 patients), or high survival (70 - 106 months, 65 patients) rate. For the implementation of automatic classifiers, the database was split into training, testing and validation data subsets (75%, 20% and 5% respectively) by random selection, but to preserve the same proportion of ranked patients, the so-called k-fold cross-validation technique was applied. The automatic classifier versions of IHC algorithms used the same raw IHC data (antibody combination) as the input, e.g. VY3 used CD10, FOXP1, and BCL6 raw IHC as well as the ANN VY3. A total of 35 automatic classifiers were trained, where Colomo and Hans use the same set of antibodies and are represented by the same automatic classifiers. The stopping criterion during the training stage for all classification algorithms was an error less than 1x10-3 or 100 training epochs, whichever was satisfied first. The performance of the eight IHC algorithms and the automatic classifiers was evaluated by computing the accuracy (Acc), specificity (Spec), and sensitivity (Sens), according to the Receiver Operating Characteristic procedure. Five classifiers obtained the highest metrics: ANN Choi, BS Choi, and BS Choi* with 94.2% Acc, 93.1% Spec, and 95.2% Sens, followed by SVM Choi and SVM VY4 with 94.2% Acc, 91.4% Spec, and 96.8% Sens. Choi was the IHC algorithm with better metrics (92.5% Acc, 84.5% Spec, and 100% Sens), which ranked 11 out of 43 models tested, followed by VY3 and VY4 (ranked 22 and 23, respectively). Survival of GCB and non-GCB groups identified by these models were compared using Kaplan-Meier curves, and the significance was calculated using log-rank test. For the best five automatic classifiers and the Choi IHC algorithm, GCB overall survival was better than non-GCB cases (p To statistically compare the models with GEP, all automatic classifiers and IHC algorithms results were analyzed by Cohen9s kappa (\u03ba) for agreement analysis and Pearson9s chi-squared test. Only Choi IHC algorithm had a very good agreement when compared with GEP (\u03ba = 0.85, p Harnessing all of the available immunohistochemical data in order to increase the DLBCL classification accuracy when compared with decision three pre-existing algorithms, we conclude that 4 antibody-based BS Choi* automatic classifier provided the best metrics and represents an affordable and time-saving alternative for DLBCL molecular subtype identification.

Most of the state-of-the-art methods are highly dependent on the labelled training samples, which are difficult to collect in practical industrial applications. To address this problem, we propose a generative adversarial network based framework for unsupervised surface inspection. The generative adversarial network is trained to generate the fake images analogous to the normal surface images. It implies that a well-trained GAN indeed learns a good representation of the normal surface images in a latent feature space. And consequently, the discriminator of GAN can serve as a naturally one-class classifier. We use the first three conventional layer of the discriminator as the feature extractor, whose response is sensitive to the abnormal regions. Particularly, a multi-scale fusion strategy is adopted to fuse the responses of the three convolution layers and thus improve the segmentation performance of abnormal detection.

In recent times, few computational studies, in particular machine learning (ML) approaches have been applied in the prediction of 4mC site predictions. Although ML-based methods are promising for 4mC identification in other species, none are available for detecting 4mCs in the mouse genome. Our novel computational approach, called 4mCpred-EL, is the first method for identifying 4mC sites in the mouse genome where four different ML algorithms with a wide range of seven feature encodings are utilized. Subsequently, those feature encodings predicted probabilistic values are used as a feature vector and are once again inputted to ML algorithms, whose corresponding models are integrated into ensemble learning.

Most studies acquire pre-collision traffic conditions by matching the collision time in the national crash database with the time in the aggregated traffic database. Since the reported collision time sometimes differs from the actual time, the matching method may result in traffic conditions not representative of pre-collision traffic dynamics. This may subsequently lead to an incorrect calibration of the model used to predict the probability of a collision. In this study, this is overcome through the use of highly disaggregated vehicle-based traffic data (i.e. vehicle trajectories) from a traffic micro-simulation (i.e. VISSIM) and the corresponding traffic conflicts (i.e. dangerous concurrences between vehicles) data generated by the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM). In particular, the idea is to use traffic conflicts as surrogate measures of traffic safety, and data on traffic collisions are therefore not needed. Two classifiers are then employed to examine the proposed idea: (i) Support Vector Machines (SVMs) \u2013 a sophisticated classifier and (ii) k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) \u2013 a relatively simple classifier. Substantial efforts are devoted to making the traffic simulation as representative to real-world as possible by employing data from a motorway section in England. Four temporally aggregated traffic datasets (i.e. 30-second, 1-minute, 3-minute and 5-minute) are examined. The main results demonstrate the viability of using traffic micro-simulation along with the SSAM for real-time conflicts prediction and the superiority of 3-minute temporal aggregation in the classification results.

However, because perceptual competencies are implicit and not necessarily verbally accessible, these methods are ill-equipped to assess them. We address these shortcomings with a method that draws on similarity learning, a machine learning technique that detects visual features that account for participants' responses to triplet comparisons of visuals. In Experiment 1, 614 chemistry students judged the similarity of Lewis structures and in Experiment 2, 489 students judged the similarity of ball-and-stick models. Our results showed that our method can detect visual features that drive students' perception and suggested that students' conceptual knowledge about molecules informed perceptual competencies through top-down processes. Furthermore, Experiment 2 tested whether we can improve the efficiency of the method with active sampling. Results showed that random sampling yielded higher accuracy than active sampling for small sample sizes.

From the aspect of land-use planning and policy making, it is important to understand the determinants of residential land abandonment across rural areas as well as to know what rural residential land is vulnerable to be abandoned. However, neither of these can be known via qualitative evaluation of residential land abandonment or via remote sensing applications and land-use modelling. In this study, we develop an approach of combining machine learning techniques (Random Forest, Supported Vector Machine, and Naive Bayes) and land-as-an-object analysis to identify the rural residential land that has a high possibility of being abandoned in mountainous areas. We applied this approach to Fang County, Central China. The results indicate a reasonable and reliable prediction of rural residential land abandonment based on our approach, particularly in estimating the potential occurrence of local land abandonment. The geographic characteristics of the land and the living conditions of the land user were found to have relatively significant impacts on rural residential land use. Our approach also provides a pathway to evaluate specific land use and identify its potential change. This approach can be useful for the development of a standardized protocol for the evaluation of residential land abandonment across other rural areas and may be applicable for the investigation of other land types that may be vulnerable to abandonment. Quantitatively assessing the influential factors of residential land use can also provide alternative insights for the development of planning protocols in order to ultimately improve the quality of life and living environments in rural areas.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.habitatint.2018.12.006", "venue": null, "journal": "Habitat International", "mag_id": "2907025726", "mag_field_of_study": ["Economics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:158739994"}

Motivated by the fact that age labels are usually correlated in the real-world applications, we carefully develop a similarity-aware function in our approach, which dynamically measures each face pair with different weights based on different age value gaps. During the learning process, we jointly optimize both procedures of generating hard-examples and learning age estimator via a sequence of adversarial-game iterations.

SA uses technologies including graph analysis, dynamic tracking, and machine learning to detect structural anomalies in large-scale information network data, while PP constructs dynamic psychological profiles from behavioral patterns.

The data set contains behavior traces from over 350,000 characters observed over a period of 6 months. SA is used to predict if and when characters quit their guild (a player association with similarities to a club or workgroup in non-gaming contexts), possibly causing damage to these social groups.

Hence, the two criteria are developed from the perspective of model selection rather than a generalization of the radius-margin bound for multiclass SVMs. As demonstrated by extensive experimental study, the minimization of these two criteria achieves good model selection on most data sets.

This paper establishes a model of sales prediction based on improved support vector machines, to forecast the sales data. Support vector regression provides global optimal solutions which avoid overtraining. To check the efficiency of forecasting model various accuracy parameters are used, including Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) etc. Development of an improved Sales forecasting model was done which is based on kernel based support vector machine and other optimization parameters. Traditional SVM classifier is a linear classifier, Kernel approach gives nonlinear classifier and maximum margin hyperplanes which in turn fit the maximum margin hyperplane into a transformed feature space. Due to the non-linear nature, kernel based SVM used to build the forecasting model to improve the forecast precision.

Two important concepts in MDA, manifold-based within-class scatter (MWCS) and manifold-based between-class scatter (MBCS), are introduced in the proposed method, the separating hyperplane found by which ensures MWCS is minimized and MBCS is maximized. Based on the above analysis, the corresponding optimal problem can be established, and then MDA transforms the original optimization problem to the QP dual form and we can obtain the support vectors and decision function. The classes of test samples are decided by the decision function. The advantage of the proposed method is that it not only focuses on the information between classes and distribution characteristics, but also preserves the manifold structure of each class.

Simulation results show that the model has better generalization and prediction accuracy, and can meet the real-time control requirements of the grinding process.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2970429", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3004054259", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["136294374", "119622055", "30719876", "121463148", "125465458", "28705264", "125198674", "29192934", "33239786", "108704957", "110238902", "54031842", "108835660", "112064977", "15279783", "111666575", "59736124", "111581378", "19367742", "26579751", "53427821", "116858", "1655107", "5348786", "10906016", "11650019", "10361983", "51610252", "23585162", "53046368", "19748631", "3634180", "13952162", "7368994"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211119901"}

In this study, we investigate the potential issues related to the stability of the matched sets created by different propensity score models and we propose some diagnostic tools to evaluate them. Methods : Matched groups of patients were created using five different methods: Logistic Regression, Classification and Regression Trees, Bagging, Random Forest and Generalized Boosted Model. Differences between subjects in the matched sets were evaluated by comparing both pre-treatment covariates and propensity score distributions. We applied our proposal to a cardio-surgical observational study that aims to compare two different procedures of cardiac valve replacement. Results : Both baseline characteristics and propensity score distributions were systematically different across matched samples of patients created with different models used to estimate propensity score. The most relevant differences were observed for the matched set created by estimating individual propensity scores with Classification and Regression Trees algorithm. Conclusion : Clinical stability of matched samples created with different statistical methods should always be evaluated to ensure reliability of final estimates.

After segmentation, in the first technique, we extract features such as texture, invariant moments, edge, shape information, and spectral contents of the segmented object. These features are fed to classifiers including Naive Bayesian (NB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for human against animal classification. In the second technique, the speeded up robust feature (SURF) extraction algorithm is applied to the segmented objects. A code book technique is used to classify objects based on SURF features. Human and animal data acquired-using the pyroelectric sensor in different terrains, are used for performance evaluation of the algorithms. The evaluation indicates that the features extracted in the first technique in conjunction with the NB classifier provide the highest classification rates.

Attackers are consistently shifting to stealthier and more complex forms of attacks in an attempt to bypass known mitigation strategies. In recent years, attackers have begun to focus their attack efforts on the application layer, allowing them to produce attacks that can exploit known issues within specific application protocols. Slow HTTP Denial of Service attacks are one such attack variant, which targets the HTTP protocol and can imitate legitimate user traffic in order to deny resources from a service. Successful mitigation of this attack type requires network analysts to evaluate large quantities of network traffic to identify and block intrusive traffic. The issue, is that the number of legitimate traffic instances can far outnumber the amount of attack instances, making detection problematic. Machine learning techniques can be used to aid in detection, but the large level of imbalance between normal (majority) and attack (minority) instances can lead to inaccurate detection results. In this work, we evaluate the use of data sampling to produce varying class distributions in order to counteract the effects of severely imbalanced Slow HTTP DoS big datasets. We also detail our process for collecting real-world representative Slow HTTP DoS attack traffic from a live network environment to create our datasets. Five class distributions are generated to evaluate the Slow HTTP DoS detection performance of eight machine learning techniques. Our results show that the optimal learner and class distribution combination is that of Random Forest with a 65:35 distribution ratio, obtaining an AUC value of 0.99904. Further, we determine through the use of significance testing, that the use of sampling techniques can significantly increase learner performance when detecting Slow HTTP DoS attack traffic.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1186/s40537-019-0230-3", "venue": "Journal of Big Data", "journal": "Journal of Big Data", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2965604686", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["17830282", "22706176", "13446425", "53164212", "15311863", "125640783", "9010330", "52166576", "19022510", "214797870", "14343487", "13861754", "1350330", "61568722", "31363328", "60753166", "29812549", "40695073", "9131045", "102354936", "15705187", "43746098", "205357047", "806596", "131842738", "169040960"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:198997515"}

The analytical lines which will be used as input variables of regression model are determined adaptively according to the samples for both training and testing. Second, an LIBS quantitative analysis method based on RVM is presented. The intensities of analytical lines and the elemental concentrations of certified standard samples are used to train the RVM regression model. The predicted elemental concentration analysis results will be given with a form of confidence interval of probabilistic distribution, which is helpful for evaluating the uncertainness contained in the measured spectra. Chromium concentration analysis experiments of 23 certified standard high-alloy steel samples have been carried out. The multiple correlation coefficient of the prediction was up to 98.85%, and the average relative error of the prediction was 4.01%.

Changes per year in GFR, FPG, and triglycerides were recognized as predictors of late development. In conclusion, ML-based methods successfully identified predictive factors for DN among patients with T2DM.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6742939", "pubmed_id": "31112000", "doi": "10.1111/cts.12647", "venue": "Clinical and Translational Science", "journal": "Clinical and Translational Science", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2999228619,2945447024", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["23896305", "24844830", "15689635", "45140636", "21635356", "35131215", "632383", "4573810", "23556814", "1554582", "140109802", "37928803", "4475073", "22574667", "207368060", "205864385", "195915451", "2367747", "3686012", "1044948", "23550879", "22705033", "31081859", "11315009", "207259774"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:160014670"}

Then, a recently-developed classifier called extreme learning machine (ELM) was combined with F-score, a simple but effective feature selection method, to jointly optimize the number of the hidden nodes of ELM and the feature subset by a grid-searching training procedure. The method was compared to two classification models combining principal component analysis with back-propagation network and support vector machine classifiers. We thoroughly assessed the performance of these classification models including the training and testing time, sensitivity and specificity from the training and testing sets, as well as network size. The experimental results showed that the number of the hidden nodes can be effectively optimized by the proposed method.

In this paper, we propose DyRep, an inductive deep representation learning framework that learns a set of functions to efficiently produce low-dimensional node embeddings that evolves over time. The learned embeddings drive the dynamics of two key processes namely, communication and association between nodes in dynamic graphs. These processes exhibit complex nonlinear dynamics that evolve at different time scales and subsequently contribute to the update of node embeddings. We employ a time-scale dependent multivariate point process model to capture these dynamics. We devise an efficient unsupervised learning procedure and demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms representative baselines on two real-world datasets for the problem of dynamic link prediction and event time prediction.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1803.04051", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2790197930", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5865347", "207557742", "62016134", "17341970", "207238980", "3051291", "8399404", "207238964", "29154877", "17660901", "3215337", "3465164", "5171092", "6410051", "1002614", "89838866", "941104", "14122089", "2174374", "12348869", "122850443", "14428372", "3190861", "13472990", "14829000", "5549418", "13332080", "8040343", "42875077", "4755450", "8964704", "206756462", "8393918", "2708270", "3144218", "14249137", "17682909", "28890170", "449844", "4892663", "22229879", "17415", "3347254", "2750116"], "inbound_citations": ["54021417", "84843003", "211171395", "207869987", "197640176", "85449975", "53306947", "201304958", "56895375", "53669669", "54446626", "203734702", "53681219", "210839302"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3979181"}

However, applying a discriminator network as a universal loss function for common supervised tasks (e.g. semantic segmentation, line detection, depth estimation) is considerably less successful. We argue that the main difficulty of applying CGANs to supervised tasks is that the generator training consists of optimizing a loss function that does not depend directly on the ground truth labels. To overcome this, we propose to replace the discriminator with a matching network taking into account both the ground truth outputs as well as the generated examples. As a consequence, the generator loss function also depends on the targets of the training examples, thus facilitating learning. We demonstrate on three computer vision tasks that this approach can significantly outperform CGANs achieving comparable or superior results to task-specific solutions and results in stable training. Importantly, this is a general approach that does not require the use of task-specific loss functions.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CVPR.2018.00837", "venue": "2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "journal": "2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2798268958", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["18828233", "2057420", "18195291", "502946", "665667", "947451", "4855369", "7920870", "1033682", "10894094", "206594692", "6447277", "14803274", "6200260", "3568073", "211227", "5916438", "32797169", "6610705", "25120102", "107645", "11758569", "1563370", "1687220", "8229065", "11996618", "1888683", "47306546", "1082740", "1277217", "2683207", "206770979"], "inbound_citations": ["195497019", "198117877", "182856984"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52832364"}

Skin diseases are among the top 5 leading cause of the worldwide disease burden. To reduce this burden, computer-aided diagnosis systems (CAD) are highly demanded. Single disease classification is the major shortcoming in the existing work. Due to the similar characteristics of skin diseases, classification of multiple skin lesions is very challenging. This research work is an extension of our existing work where a novel classification scheme is proposed for multi-class classification. The proposed classification framework can classify an input skin image into one of the six non-overlapping classes i.e., healthy, acne, eczema, psoriasis, benign and malignant melanoma. The proposed classification framework constitutes four steps, i.e., pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction and classification. Different image processing and machine learning techniques are used to accomplish each step. 10-fold cross-validation is utilized, and experiments are performed on 1800 images. An accuracy of 94.74% was achieved using Quadratic Support Vector Machine. The proposed classification scheme can help patients in the early classification of skin lesions.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/computers8030062", "venue": "Computers", "journal": "Computers", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2971189227", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["207473792", "562812", "23498603", "90263399", "3569886", "25279918", "2987945", "51252730", "8760989", "7340568", "126126502", "53307659", "3472930", "55478949", "62653358", "31911806", "12130032", "18574938", "17451112", "18504638", "20288112", "10768153", "209495685", "45274084", "12915505", "26015946", "8709153", "59601408", "43570854", "14454728"], "inbound_citations": ["214629989"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202782445"}

Based on this, we propose a new indoor target intrusion detection approach based on iterative transfer learning without special device. In concrete terms, this approach relies on iterative transfer learning to use the signal received by Monitor Points (MPs) to determine whether there is a target intrusion in the environment, infer the area where the target is located, and consequently achieve autonomous cognitive sensing of environmental change. Specifically, first of all, we use the Received Signal Strength (RSS) data collected offline and their corresponding silence and intrusion labels to construct a source domain. Second, the cross-validation is applied to perform preliminary calibration on the RSS data collected online to obtain their corresponding pseudo-labels, and then these pseudo-labels are utilized to construct the target domain. Finally, the labels of target domain are obtained through the iterative intra-class transfer learning between the source and target domains. Furthermore, the experimental results show that the proposed approach can not only achieve high intrusion detection accuracy with a small number of RSS data, but also perform well in the cognitive sensing of the change of MPs.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11036-019-01335-2", "venue": "MONET", "journal": "MONET", "mag_id": "2970873551", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202787776"}

The ranking approach facilitates inclusion of arbitrary features over both the input sequence and output stress pattern.

In this paper, a combinatorial approach has been proposed, which consists of three feature reduction algorithms that have been applied in a parallel manner to cooperate. We consider each of these algorithms as a component in a reduction framework. For each component, among all various attribute selection algorithms, the Tabu Search (TS) a useful and state of the art algorithm, is used. To take account of the interaction between features, more subsets should be examined. Hence, each component should explore individually through feature space in a local area which is different from other components. The proposed algorithm, called the Cooperative-Tabu-Search (CTS), and also a revised version of this new method, is introduced to accelerate the convergence. After sufficient iterations, which satisfy the objective function; the final subset has been selected by voting between three reduction phases, and the data is then transformed into the new space, where the data are classified with some commonly used classifiers, such as Nearest Neighbor (NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

We investigate the impact of microarray based data characteristics on the predictive performance for various classification rules using simulation studies.

Each target stimulus frequency corresponds to a speed level. Such a conventional SSVEP-BCI is choice selection paradigm with discrete information, allowing users to discretely control the speed of a movable object. This can result in non-smooth object movement. To overcome the problem, in this study, a conceptual design of a SSVEP-BCI with continuous information for continuous control is proposed to allow users to control the moving speed of an object smoothly. A predictive model for SSVEP magnitude variation plays an important role in the proposed design. Thus, this study mainly focuses on a feasibility study concerning the use of SSVEP magnitude prediction for BCI. A basic experiment is therefore conducted to gather SSVEP responses from varying stimulus intensity using times with a fixed frequency. Random Forest Regression (RF) is outperformed by simple regression and neural networks in these predictive tasks.

Although recommendation techniques have obtained distinct developments over the decades, traditional CF algorithms still have these following two limitations: (1) relational dependency within predictions, an important factor especially when the data is sparse, is not being utilized effectively; and (2) straightforward methods for combining features like linear integration suffer from high computing complexity in learning the weights by enumerating the whole value space, making it difficult to combine various information into an unified approach. In this paper, we propose a novel model, Multi-scale Continuous Conditional Random Fields (MCCRF), as a framework to solve above problems for social recommendations. In MCCRF, relational dependency within predictions is modeled by the Markov property, thus predictions are generated simultaneously and can help each other. This strategy has never been employed previously. Besides, diverse information and relations in social network can be modeled by state and edge feature functions in MCCRF, whose weights can be optimized globally. Thus both problems can be solved under this framework. In addition, We propose to utilize Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation methods to solve the difficulties in training and inference processes of MCCRF.

Financial restatements have been a major concern for the regulators, investors and market participants. Most of the previous studies focus only on fraudulent (or intentional) restatements and the literature has largely ignored unintentional restatements. Earlier studies have shown that large scale unintentional restatements can be equally detrimental and may erode investors confidence. Therefore it is important for us to pay a close to the significant unintentional restatements as well. A lack of focus on unintentional restatements could lead to a more relaxed internal control environment and lessen the efforts for curbing managerial oversights and instances of misreporting. In order to address this research gap, we focus on developing predictive models based on both intentional (fraudulent) and unintentional (erroneous) financial restatements using a comprehensive real dataset that includes 3,513 restatement cases over a period of 2001 to 2014. To the best of our knowledge it is the most comprehensive dataset used in the financial restatement predictive models. Our study also makes contributions to the datamining literature by (i) focussing on various datamining techniques and presenting a comparative analysis, (ii) ensuring the robustness of various predictive models over different time periods. We have employed all widely used data mining techniques in this area, namely, Decision Tree (DT), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Nave Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) Classifier while developing the predictive models. We find that ANN outperforms other data mining algorithms in our empirical setup in terms of accuracy and area under the ROC curve. It is worth noting that our models remain consistent over the full sample period (2001-2014), pre-financial-crisis period (2001-2008), and post-financial-crisis period (2009-2014). We believe this study will benefit academics, regulators, policymakers and investors. In particular, regulators and policymakers can pay a close attention to the suspected firms and investors can take actions in advance to reduce their investment risks.

The state of the art classification method is support vector machine (SVM). However, the computational burden of kernel SVM limits its application to large scale datasets that demand high computational time. So, one way to cope the limitation is using ensemble approach that splits the data and applies learning procedure at each subset of data. In this work, the Clustered Support Vector Machine (CSVM) is chosen. So far, the studies of CSVM are limited to theoretical and direct application for real dataset. The application to real dataset directly has a weakness that we never know in detail how various characteristic in predictor affect the learning process. So, it is necessary to do a simulation study to further explore how complex the data, particularly in predictor, that can be handled by SVM and CSVM. There are ten scenarios conducted in this simulation study. The response label is generated using Iogistic regression model with various characteristic setting in predictor in each scenario. Given the true response label is generated using Iogit model, the results of this simulation study show that SVM and CSVM can compensate the performance of Iogistic regression in some scenarios.

This allows developing precise algorithms for each group in order to produce high performance segmentation results. Second, a modified version of ASM is used to detect the brain boundary in images by utilizing prior knowledge of each group. Finally, CNN and the post-processing methods such as Conditional Random Field, Gaussian Process and some special rules are applied to refine segmentation contour produced by ASM.

For a subcatchment of the Orme River, we mapped erosion processes by interpreting aerial photographs and field observations. These were classified as erosional response units (ERU), i.e. spatial areas of homogeneous erosion processes. The ERU were used as the response variable in the soil erosion modelling process. We applied two models i) bootstrap aggregation (Random Forest: RF), and ii) stochastic gradient boosting (TreeNet: TN) to predict the potential spatial distribution of erosion processes for the entire Orme River catchment. The models are statistically evaluated using training data and a set of performance parameters such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), Cohen's Kappa, and pseudo R2. Variable importance and response curves provide further insight into controlling factors of erosion. Both models provided good performance in terms of classification and calibration; however, TN outperformed RF. Similar classes such as active and inactive landslides can be discriminated and well interpreted by considering response curves and relative variable importance. The spatial distribution of the predicted erosion susceptibilities generally follows topographic constraints and is similar for both models. Hence, the model-based delineation of ERU on the basis of soil and terrain information is a valuable tool in geomorphology; it provides insights into factors controlling erosion processes and may allow the extrapolation and prediction of erosion processes in unsurveyed areas.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.geomorph.2010.10.022", "venue": null, "journal": "Geomorphology", "mag_id": "2077850282", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["129431721", "52011017", "55236569", "165066626", "129118792", "134819996", "133177440", "130255558", "134442151", "210270120", "17723335", "129149799", "53391246", "128991864", "134229969", "165143644", "62840938", "171093855", "134387445"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:129711894"}

Secondly, using different linear regressions extract linear characteristics of the rainfall system, and using different Neural Network (NN) algorithms and different network architectures extract nonlinear characteristics of the rainfall system.

In this work, a meaningful sample of CF algorithms widely reported in the literature were chosen for analysis; they represent different stages in the evolutive process of CF, starting from simple user correlations, going through online learning, up to methods which use classification techniques. Our main purpose is to compare these algorithms when applied on multi-valued ratings.Experiments were conducted on three well-known datasets with different characteristics, using two protocols and four evaluation metrics, representing coverage, accuracy, reliability and agreement of predictions with respect to real values. Results from such experiments showed that the memory-based method is a good option because its results are more precise and reliable compared with the other methods. Online Learning methods exhibit a good level of accuracy with low variation, which makes them reliable models. On the other hand, Support Vector Machines generate predictions with acceptable agreement; however, their accuracy depends on the characteristics of the input data.

Recently, it has become common to locally parametrize these models using rich features extracted by recurrent neural networks (such as LSTM), while enforcing consistent outputs through a simple linear-chain model, representing Markovian dependencies between successive labels. However, the simple graphical model structure belies the often complex non-local constraints between output labels. For example, many fields, such as a first name, can only occur a fixed number of times, or in the presence of other fields. While RNNs have provided increasingly powerful context-aware local features for sequence tagging, they have yet to be integrated with a global graphical model of similar expressivity in the output distribution. Our model goes beyond the linear chain CRF to incorporate multiple hidden states per output label, but parametrizes their transitions parsimoniously with low-rank log-potential scoring matrices, effectively learning an embedding space for hidden states. This augmented latent space of inference variables complements the rich feature representation of the RNN, and allows exact global inference obeying complex, learned non-local output constraints.

In our technique, for each cough episode, we do the following: 1) filter noise; 2) use domain expertise to partition each cough episode into multiple segments, indicative of disease or otherwise; 3) identify a limited number of audio features for each cough segment; 4) remove inherent biases as a result of sample size differences; and 5) design a two-level classification scheme, based on the idea of Random Forests, to process a recorded cough segment. Our classifier, at the first-level, identifies whether or not a given cough segment indicates a disease. If yes, the second-level classifier identifies the cough segment as symptomatic of COPD or CHF. Testing with a cohort of 9 COPD, 9 CHF, and 18 CONTROLS subjects spread across both the genders, races, and ages, our system achieves good performance in terms of Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy, and Area under ROC curve. The proposed system has the potential to aid early access to healthcare, and may be also used to educate patients on self-care at home.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30273159", "doi": "10.1109/JBHI.2018.2872038", "venue": "IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics", "journal": "IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2893591399", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["16430793", "22593093", "15789691", "14324941", "13438459", "20687369", "16078128", "5400397", "23693141", "4333477", "11762685", "14056182", "1554582", "2702042", "2715867", "89141", "4489657", "16326925", "5771787"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52896414"}

Modeling of the mobility of benzoaromatic carboxylate derivatives as a function of molecular structures was established by means of the least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM). This model was applied for the prediction of the mobility of benzoaromatic carboxylates, which were not in the modeling procedure.

Another advantage of this approach is that it is applicable to routine operating data that may lack any external excitations. Theoretical derivations on the closed-loop identification method are provided in this paper, showing that it can furnish a consistent parameter estimate for the process model even in the case where a priori knowledge about the true noise model structure is not available.

In this paper, we radically improve automated hate speech detection by presenting a novel model that leverages intra-user and inter-user representation learning for robust hate speech detection on Twitter. In addition to the target Tweet, we collect and analyze the user's historical posts to model intra-user Tweet representations. To suppress the noise in a single Tweet, we also model the similar Tweets posted by all other users with reinforced inter-user representation learning techniques.

It was originally proposed with the inspiration from biological learning and has attracted massive attentions due to its adaptability to various tasks with a fast learning ability and efficient computation cost. As an effective sparse representation method, orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) method can be embedded into ELM to overcome the singularity problem and improve the stability. Usually OMP recovers a sparse vector by minimizing a least squares (LS) loss, which is efficient for Gaussian distributed data, but may suffer performance deterioration in presence of non-Gaussian data. To address this problem, a robust matching pursuit method based on a novel kernel risk-sensitive loss (in short KRSLMP) is first proposed in this paper. The KRSLMP is then applied to ELM to solve the sparse output weight vector, and the new method named the KRSLMP-ELM is developed for SLFN learning.

Attempts have been made to identify DNA-BPs based on their sequence and structural information with moderate accuracy. Here we develop a machine learning protocol for the prediction of DNA-BPs where the classifier is Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Information used for classification is derived from characteristics that include surface and overall composition, overall charge and positive potential patches on the protein surface. In total 121 DNA-BPs and 238 non-binding proteins are used to build and evaluate the protocol. In self-consistency, accuracy value of 100% has been achieved. For cross-validation (CV) optimization over entire dataset, we report an accuracy of 90%. Using leave 1-pair holdout evaluation, the accuracy of 86.3% has been achieved. When we restrict the dataset to less than 20% sequence identity amongst the proteins, the holdout accuracy is achieved at 85.8%. Furthermore, seven DNA-BPs with unbounded structures are all correctly predicted. The current performances are better than results published previously. The higher accuracy value achieved here originates from two factors: the ability of the SVM to handle features that demonstrate a wide range of discriminatory power and, a different definition of the positive patch. Since our protocol does not lean on sequence or structural homology, it can be used to identify or predict proteins with DNA-binding function(s) regardless of their homology to the known ones.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC1283538", "pubmed_id": "16284202", "doi": "10.1093/nar/gki949", "venue": "Nucleic Acids Research", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2027364181", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["2037478", "28621061", "24321239", "8031269", "14491256", "21341970", "18256527", "14468648", "2421876", "6979112", "785575", "13859890", "1278809", "9065946", "206787478", "44250418", "2698102", "5612883", "7873586", "91559650", "996376", "41953747", "29185760", "14727192", "14496163", "16668189", "1623856", "23780026"], "inbound_citations": ["203569217", "5270579", "2944273", "16517371", "6888751", "206204431", "214931170", "15258546", "201666185", "6464636", "1802664", "11051656", "7693870", "83836755", "32090686", "116521", "16638761", "32581669", "31407501", "5585119", "7539092", "18711231", "7326315", "18718010", "160012476", "58905475", "19071918", "121184143", "215474973", "5909636", "14340163", "3162881", "32755361", "7190562", "16420389", "215029251", "13623877", "49406159", "12268982", "11381645", "18783195", "15181048", "49573055", "19073814", "8320048", "33025929", "12153238", "7886473", "18751574", "16047378", "11746682", "27192283", "215549850", "4633868", "5173553", "55247074", "14514863", "12447105", "14206993", "18810466", "5557091", "9742925", "2596485", "54436347", "11599479", "3678690", "16340529", "13909292", "52160846", "2181319", "33784714", "67861059", "824073", "1090149", "958476", "215637225", "206095758"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7956604"}

Support Vector Regression (SVR) appears to be an efficient tool which has been widely used in recent years. It is also reported to have a higher accuracy and generalization ability than other traditional methods. The SVR method deals with the nonlinear problem by mapping the input feature space into a high dimensional space so that it becomes a linear problem. Kernel function is one of the crucial components in SVR algorithm as it is used to calculate the inner product between vectors in the mapped high dimensional space. The kernel function of Radial Basis Function (RBF), which is based on the Euclidean distance, is the most commonly used kernel function in SVR. However, the SVR algorithm may neglect the effect of correlation among the features when processing the training data in time series forecasting problems due to the limitation of Euclidean distance. In this chapter, a Mabalanobis distance RBF kernel is introduced. It is well known that when we need to calculate similarity between two vectors (samples), the use of Mahalanobis distance can take into account the correlation among the features. Thus, the SVR with Mahalanobis distance kernel function may follow the behavior of the data sets better so that it can give more accurate result. From the comparative investigation, we find that in some circumstances, the Mabalanobis distance RBF kernel based SVR can outperform the Euclidean distance based SVR.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-33439-9_10", "venue": "Time Series Analysis, Modeling and Applications", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "87513833", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["203689008"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:26328945"}

Forty morphometric attributes, generated from a digital elevation model, were used as independent variables, in addition to geophysical data, images from the Landsat 8 satellite and the NDVI. All possible combinations between the satellite bands were calculated, generating 28 new variables. Combinations between the Th, U and K bands obtained from the geophysical data were also calculated, generating a further three variables. The final variables to be calculated were the distances between the four points of the edges of the basin (d1, d2, d3 and d4). The dependent variables for the model were Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, Si, Ti, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, P, Pb, V, Zn, Zr, S and Cl. A total of 200 soil samples were used, which were collected from 100 points at two depths (0-10 and 10-30 cm); the total elements were determined using an X-ray fluorescence analyzer. The Random Forest algorithm proved to be superior to the others in predicting the chemical attributes of the soil at both depths, and is suitable for predicting soil attributes in the study region.

Since fatigue is not a physical variable, fatigue indices are commonly used to detect and monitor muscle fatigue development. One suggested approach to quantitative measurement of muscle fatigue is based on surface electromyography (sEMG) signal. Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) are commonly used techniques to obtain time-frequency representation of sEMG signals. However, S Transform (ST) technique has not been applied much to physiological signals. No found literature has used ST technique to extract muscle fatigue indices. Thus, this study intends to determine the feasibility of using ST technique to extract muscle fatigue indices from sEMG signal. Thirty college students with no illness history were randomly selected to perform bicep curl activities for 130 seconds while holding a 2 kg dumbbell. Using the three time-frequency techniques (STFT, CWT, and ST), four commonly extracted muscle fatigue indices (Instantaneous Energy Distribution (IED), Instantaneous Mean Frequency (IMNF), Instantaneous Frequency Variance (IFV) and Instantaneous Normalize Spectral Moment (INSM)) were extracted from the acquired biceps sEMG signals. Indices from fatigue signals were found to be significantly different (p-value < 0.05) from the non-fatigue signals. Based on the Normalization of Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) and Relative Error, ST technique was found to produce less error than STFT and CWT techniques in extracting muscle fatigue indices. Through the use of 3-fold cross validation procedure and with the help of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, IMNF-IED-IFV was selected as the best feature combination for classifying the two phases of muscle fatigue with consistent classification performance (accuracy, sensitivity and specificity) of 80%. Therefore, this study concludes that ST processing technique is feasible to be applied to sEMG signals for extracting screening or monitoring measures of muscle fatigue with a good degree of certainty.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2914512048", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:128248735"}

In contrast, machine learning algorithms allow for multivariate fire classifications. This study compared the accuracy of fire-severity classifications from SI thresholding with those from Random Forests (RF). Reference data were from 3730 plots within the boundaries of eight major wildfires across the six temperate forest \u2018functional\u2019 groups of Victoria, south-eastern Australia. The reference plots were randomly divided into training and validation datasets (60/40) for each fire-severity class (unburnt, low, moderate, high) and forest functional group. SI fire-severity classifications were conducted using thresholds derived in a previous study based on the same datasets. A RF classification algorithm was trained to derive fire-severity levels based on appropriate spectral indices and their temporal difference. The RF classification outperformed the SI thresholding approach in most cases, increasing overall accuracy by 11% on a forest-group basis, and 16% on an individual wildfire basis. Adding more predictor variables into the RF algorithm did not improve classification accuracy. Greater overall accuracies (by 12% on average) were achieved when in situ data (rather than data from other fires) were used to train the RF algorithm.

Similar to the popular Gradient Boosting (GB), this new member is presented as a forward stagewise additive model that attempts to reduce the loss at each iteration by sequentially fitting a simple base learner to complement the running predictions. Instead of relying on the negative gradient, as is the case for GB, DB adopts a new measure called delta as the basis. Delta is defined as the loss minimizer at an observation level. We also show that DB is the optimal boosting member for a wide range of loss functions. The optimality is a consequence of DB solving for the split and adjustment simultaneously to maximize loss reduction at each iteration. In addition, we introduce an asymptotic version of DB that works well for all twice-differentiable strictly convex loss functions. This asymptotic behavior does not depend on the number of observations, but rather on a high number of iterations that can be augmented through common regularization techniques. We show that the basis in the asymptotic extension differs from the basis in GB only by a multiple of the second derivative of the log-likelihood. The multiple is considered to be a correction factor, one that corrects the bias toward the observations with high second derivatives in GB. When negative log-likelihood is used as the loss function, this correction can be interpreted as a credibility adjustment for the process variance. Simulation studies and real data application we conducted suggest that DB is a significant improvement over GB. The performance of the asymptotic version is less dramatic, but the improvement is still compelling. Like GB, DB provides a high transparency to users, and we can review the marginal influence of variables through relative importance charts and the partial dependence plots.

However, the restricted clinical applicability of current methods is due in particular to the limitation to simple situations and the important computational cost. Methods: We propose in this manuscript an approach to tackle these two issues. First, we analyze more complex propagation patterns (multiple onsets and scar tissue) using relevance vector regression and shape dimensionality reduction on a large simulated database. Second, this learning is performed offline on a reference anatomy and transferred onto patient-specific anatomies in order to achieve fast personalized predictions online. Results: We evaluated our method on a dataset composed of 20 dyssynchrony patients with a total of 120 different cardiac cycles. The comparison with a commercially available electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) method shows a good identification of the cardiac activation pattern. From the cardiac parameters estimated in sinus rhythm, we predicted five different paced patterns for each patient. The comparison with the body surface potential mappings (BSPM) measured during pacing and the ECGI method indicates a good predictive power. Conclusion: We showed that learning offline from a large simulated database on a reference anatomy was able to capture the main cardiac EP characteristics from noninvasive measurements for fast patient-specific predictions. Significance: The fast CRT pacing predictions are a step forward to a noninvasive CRT patient selection and therapy optimisation, to help clinicians in these difficult tasks.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29993409", "doi": "10.1109/TBME.2018.2839713", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2804047564", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["9538168", "15814802", "3508894", "3531824", "118112771", "25226887", "6201213", "435763", "206616562", "19304522", "19821828", "34038691", "25846098", "72916645", "16336421", "17519427", "37789018", "2422946", "12832643", "26884910", "60665149", "29624593", "38476214", "20816992", "6034346", "17437456", "15179374", "390988", "23911136", "37430567", "4606073", "4662533", "64728510", "22385660", "12720597", "118289276"], "inbound_citations": ["149541351", "204800565", "53294167"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49546808"}

This information can be deduced from the star formation rate (SFR) and the stellar mass (Mstar), both of which, but especially the SFR, are very complex to estimate. Determining these quantities from UV, optical, or IR luminosities relies on complex modeling and on priors on galaxy types. We propose a method based on the machine-learning algorithm Random Forest to estimate the SFR and the Mstar of galaxies at redshifts in the range 0.01<z<0.3, independent of their type. The machine-learning algorithm takes as inputs the redshift, WISE luminosities, and WISE colours in near-IR, and is trained on spectra-extracted SFR and Mstar from the SDSS MPA-JHU DR8 catalogue as outputs. We show that our algorithm can accurately estimate SFR and Mstar with scatters of sigma_SFR=0.38 dex and sigma_Mstar=0.16 dex for SFR and stellar mass, respectively, and that it is unbiased with respect to redshift or galaxy type. The full-sky coverage of the WISE satellite allows us to characterise the star-formation activity of all galaxies outside the Galactic mask with spectroscopic redshifts in the range 0.01<z<0.3. The method can also be applied to photometric-redshift catalogues, with best scatters of sigma_SFR=0.42 dex and sigma_Mstar=0.24 dex obtained in the redshift range 0.1<z<0.3.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1901.01932", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1051/0004-6361/201833972", "venue": "A&A 622, A137 (2019)", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2907474932", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": ["31039418"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:119103587"}

This scenario does not respond well to a big number of recent applications (such as tendency analysis on social networks, video surveillance, sensor monitoring, etc.), especially when working with data streams which require real-time adaptation to the content of the data. In this paper, we propose a model that is able to perform online data classification and can adapt to data classes, never seen by the model before, while preserving previously learned information. Our approach does not need to store and reuse previous observations, which is a big advantage for data-streams applications, since the dataset one wants to work with can potentially be of very large size.

However, natural ventilation requirements and guidelines in current building codes and standards are either qualitative or quantitative but subject to an absolute indoor airspeed threshold without considering the outdoor wind environment. To fill this gap, this paper develops an urban-scale coupled indoor and outdoor computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model and defines a novel ventilation index to assess natural ventilation potential. The index considers wind environments of both indoor and outdoor spaces. First, the coupled CFD model is developed to study wind-driven cross ventilation in high-density cities. A 3D isothermal CFD simulation is solved using the RNG k-e turbulent model. The simulation results are compared with wind tunnel experiment data from literature. Second, six key design variables are used to generate 3840 parametric design variations for natural ventilation assessment. Third, a novel integrated index C I O I v (coupled indoor and outdoor interaction) is proposed to evaluate the wind speed ratio between the indoor area and outdoor reference area. For demonstration, C I O I v , F 1 is used to represent C I O I v on the ground level. Data-driven C I O I v , F 1 models are developed to predict indoor building ventilation potential for quick early design support.

The space-variant sampling mechanism of the retina is called retinotopic sampling (RS).Withthese mechanisms of the retina, the object-detection isformulated as finding appropriatecoordinate transformation from a coordinate system on an input image, to a coordinate system on the retina. However, when the object size is inferred by thismechanism, the result tends to gravitate towards zero. To cancel this gravity, the space-variant sampling mechanism is modified to uniform sampling mechanism, but a concept of RS is equivalently introduced by using space-variant weights. This object-detection mechanism is modeled as a non-parametric method. By using the model based on RS, we formulate a kernel function as an analytical function of information of an object, a position and a size of the object in an image.

The first one, of axiomatic character, is related to balance laws (momentum, mass, energy,...), whereas the second one consists of models that scientists have extracted from collected, natural or synthetic data. Even if one can be confident on the first type of equations, the second one contains modeling errors. Moreover, this second type of equations remains too particular and often fails in describing new experimental results. The vast majority of existing models lack of generality, and therefore must be constantly adapted or enriched to describe new experimental findings. In this work we propose a new method, able to directly link data to computers in order to perform numerical simulations. These simulations will employ axiomatic, universal laws while minimizing the need of explicit, often phenomenological, models.

Metric learning, which learns a similarity metric, plays an important role in human action recognition. However, learning a full-rank matrix is usually inefficient and easily leads to overfitting. In order to overcome the above issues, a common way is to impose the low-rank constraint on the learned matrix. This paper proposes a novel Cholesky decomposition based metric learning (CDML) method for effective video-based human action recognition. Firstly, the improved dense trajectories technique and the vector of locally aggregated descriptor (VLAD) are respectively used for feature detection and feature encoding. Then, considering the high dimensionality of VLAD features, we propose to learn a similarity matrix by taking advantage of Cholesky decomposition, which decomposes the matrix into the product between a lower triangular matrix and its symmetric matrix. Different from the traditional low-rank metric learning methods that explicitly adopt the low-rank constraint to learn the matrix, the proposed algorithm achieves such a constraint by controlling the rank of the lower triangular matrix, thus leading to high computational efficiency. Experimental results on the public video dataset show that the proposed method achieves the superior performance compared with several state-of-the-art methods.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2966329", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2999006617", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["149732617", "4103647", "1150114", "2493017", "14454898", "206590483", "130535382", "266124", "1995092", "52846726", "3979134", "1832018", "206595144", "23083969", "753512", "3148797", "13537104", "1350374", "8729004", "12795415", "9437674", "12365014", "49215108", "69715052", "155108626", "238206", "149446564", "32577220", "14160859", "23147098"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212636238"}

Due to the complexity of climate-associated processes, different sources of uncertainty influence the projected behavior of hydro-climate variables in regression-based statistical downscaling procedures. The current study presents a comprehensive methodology to improve the predictive power of the procedure to provide improved projections. It does this by minimizing the uncertainty sources arising from the high-dimensionality of atmospheric predictors, the complex and nonlinear relationships between hydro-climate predictands and atmospheric predictors, as well as the biases that exist in climate model simulations. To address the impact of the high dimensional feature spaces, a supervised nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm is presented that is able to capture the nonlinear variability among projectors through extracting a sequence of principal components that have maximal dependency with the target hydro-climate variables. Two soft-computing nonlinear machine-learning methods, Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), are engaged to capture the nonlinear relationships between predictand and atmospheric predictors. To correct the spatial and temporal biases over multiple time scales in the GCM predictands, the Multivariate Recursive Nesting Bias Correction (MRNBC) approach is used. The results demonstrate that this combined approach significantly improves the downscaling procedure in terms of precipitation projection.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.02.040", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Hydrology", "mag_id": "2274400412", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["52216365", "38770839", "201319397", "49668450", "214918019", "126348825", "52047929", "54916229", "131719921", "135026266"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:131233292"}

This results in models which do not perform well when used to make predictions about the future state of the graph -- especially when the delta between time stamps is not small. In this work, we explore a novel training procedure and an associated unsupervised model which creates graph representations optimised to predict the future state of the graph.

Current stimulation strategies attempt to stop seizures after they start, but none aim to prevent seizures altogether. Preventing seizures requires knowing when the brain is entering a preictal state (i.e., approaching seizure onset). Here we show that such preictal activity can be detected by an informative neural signal that progressively and monotonically changes as the brain approaches a seizure event. Specifically, we use local field potentials (LFP) from a rat model of epilepsy to develop an innovative measure of signal novelty relative to nonseizure activity, that shows the presence of progressive neural dynamics in an ultra broad band (4 Hz - 5 kHz). The measure is extracted from functional connectivity features computed from the LFPs which are used as an input to a one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM). The SVM outputs a scalar signal which quantifies how novel the current activity looks relative to baseline (non-seizure) activity and shows a progression towards seizure onset minutes ahead of time. The use of ultra broad band multivariate features into the SVM results in a novelty signal that has a significantly higher slope in the progression to seizure onset when compared to using power in conventional frequency bands (4 - 500 Hz) on individual channels as input features to the SVM. Functional connectivity in conjunction with the SVM is a strategy that generates a new measurement of novelty that can be used by closed-loop systems for seizure forecasting and prevention.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30440860", "doi": "10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512769", "venue": "2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)", "journal": "2018 40th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2899026020", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["205516145", "578193", "14338263", "2679226", "36145482", "24347030", "40457065", "9353601", "3565527", "9879416", "15484646", "25684337", "1880123", "23823311"], "inbound_citations": ["212637229"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13752039"}

In the traditional methods of modelling and forecasting we have met specific disadvantages such as: Difficulty in tuning the parameters of the algorithms, difficulty of the linear methods to provide precise predictions, the overfitting problem that may occur during the training phase of the algorithm and last but not least, the fact that modelling and prediction are in many occasions separable problems. The models describing financial time-series are changing as time goes by and as a result traditional techniques seeking a model capable to describe the time-series all time long fail. ::: The purpose of the present master thesis is to combine effectively the Genetic Algorithms (GA\u2019s) with Support Vector Regression (SVR), a subcase of Support Vector Machines (SVM\u2019s) algorithm. GA\u2019s belong to the family of heuristic algorithms that simulate natural selection. GA\u2019s also belong to the wide scientific area of Evolutionary Algorithms. They are seeking for an optimal solution for a problem, by applying an automated process. SVM\u2019s on the other hand, belong to the family of supervised learning algorithms and nowadays are considered pioneers in the scientific field of machine learning. Their purpose is to find the optimal hyper-plane, namely the optimal classification of the spots belonging in different categories, in terms of Euclidian distance between them. The subcase of SVR is trying to predict with as much precision as possible the dependent variables of a function in connection with its independent variables. ::: SVM\u2019s are general-purpose classifiers as the don\u2019t need in advance knowledge. Despite their strong theoretical background and promising experimenting results, yet they have proven incapable to overcome the curse of dimensionality and the correct parameter tuning obstacles. As a result neural networks have demonstrated better performance in many cases so far. ::: GA\u2019s have been widely applied in portfolio management and for solving investing problems[1]. SVM\u2019s on the other hand, are commonly used in many classification and prediction problems in financial time-series[2,3]. Nevertheless, they still have a long way to go, in order to become a major forecasting algorithm in financial time-series prediction. ::: ::: ::: The GA [4,5] implemented in this master thesis, have been optimized by making use of decimal encoding instead of the typically used binary. Furthermore, rank based selection is been used during the selection of the individuals chosen to pass to the next generation. This selection method tries to minimize the selection problem when the variance of the cost function is high and vice-versa. The maximum number of generations is used as the termination criterion of this specific algorithm. Due to the non-static nature of the stock markets, we also made use of the sliding-window technique in our datasets. ::: During the implementation, the GA chooses the dependent variables that affect the prediction of the independent variable. Furthermore, through the procedure, we select the best values for the parameter of normalization and (the parameter of the Gaussian kernel function) for the SVM algorithm. Optimization of those two parameters is significantly important, as parameter defines the balance between complexity and performance and on the other hand, because of the non-linearity of the data a properly tuned kernel function is of high importance. For the implementation of the GA, we made use of an objection function, in order to optimize metrics suitable for the evaluation of investing strategies (annualized return for instance). ::: The proposed method is used in order to predict the closing prices for the shares of National Bank of Greece (NBG), the Piraeus Bank (PEIR), the Organization for Forecasting Football Matches in Greece (OPAP), the Greek Telecommunications Organization (OTE) and the software providing company INTRALOT (INLOT). All the aforementioned companies belong to the Greek stock market located in Athens, Greece (XAA). Our implementation is compared in this thesis with the traditional Buy and Hold strategy and with the SVR algorithm without using GA\u2019s.

The captured power traces were analyzed using Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) learning algorithm based multiclass classifiers to classify the power traces into the respective Hamming distance (HD) classes. To extract power samples with high information about HD classes, Signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) metric was chosen for feature selection. The experimental results of power trace classifications of test set showed a high success rate of 98% when the five largest SNR sample instants over a clock cycle were chosen as features.

For social science this means we must not only evaluate the mathematics but also the assumptions underlying the systems themselves. This paper attempts to show that such social-structural concepts as class, race, gender and ethnicity produce analytic difficulties so serious that the concept of structuralism itself must be reconceptualised to make it adequate to the demands of Chaos theory. The most compelling mode of doing this is through the use of Connectionism. The paper will also attempt to show this effectively means the successful inclusion of Chaos theory into social sciences represents both a new paradigm and a new epistemology and not just a refinement to the existing structuralist models.

In order to perform efficient hash learning by simultaneously preserving the semantic similarity and data structures in the feature space, this paper presents the semi-supervised metric learning-based anchor graph hashing method. Our proposed approach can be divided into three parts. First, we exploit a transformation matrix to construct the anchor-based similarity graph of the training set. Second, we propose the objective function based on the triplet relationship, in which the optimal transformation matrix can be learned by using the smoothness of labels and the margin hinge loss incurred by the triplet constraint.

A successful diagnosis can only be made using laparoscopy. During the disease, the amount of some molecules (i.e., proteins, antigens) changes in the blood. Raman spectroscopy provides information about biochemicals without using dyes or external labels. In this study, Raman spectroscopy is used as a non-invasive diagnostic method for endometriosis.

This study presents an algorithm that automatically estimates the AHI value using a disposable HealthPatch TM sensor. Volunteers (n=53, AHI: 0.1 85.8) participated in an overnight PSG study with patch sensors attached to their chest at three specified locations and data were wirelessly acquired. Features were computed for 150- second epochs of patch sensor data using analyses of heart rate variability, respiratory signals, posture and movements. Linear Support Vector Machine classifier was trained to detect the presence/absence of apnea/hypopnea events for each epoch. The number of epochs identified with events was subsequently mapped to AHI values using quadratic regression analysis. The classifier and regression models were optimized to minimize the mean-square error of AHI based on leave-one-out cross- validation. Comparison of predicted and reference AHI values resulted in linear correlation coefficients of 0.87, 0.88 and 0.92 for the three locations, respectively. The predicted AHI values were subsequently used to classify the control-to-mild apnea group (AHI<15) and moderate-to-severe apnea (AHI 15) with an accuracy (95% confidence intervals) of 89.4% (77.4 95.4%), 85.0% (70.9 92.9%), and 82.9% (67.3 91.9%) for the three lo- cations, respectively.

The costs of home sleep tests vary greatly with inconsistent coding, billing, and coverage (3). The patient is required to return the monitor to the clinician's office either by drop-off or mail after the home sleep test. Additionally, a waiting period of at least couple of weeks after the sleep test is commonly required to obtain the results, since the algorithms on PSG and home-based monitors predict AHI based on the laborious sleep physician's visual analysis of events using oxygen saturation and airflow signals.

At present, there remain influential connectionists who continue to defend connectionism as a more realistic paradigm for modeling cognition, at all levels of abstraction, than the classical methods of AI. Not infrequently, one encounters arguments along these lines: given what we know about neurophysiology, it is just not plausible to suppose that our brains are digital computers. Thus, they could not support a classical architecture. I argue here for a middle ground between connectionism and classicism. I assume, for argument's sake, that some form(s) of connectionism can provide reasonably approximate models \u2013 at least for lower-level cognitive processes. Given this assumption, I argue on theoretical and empirical grounds that most human mental skills must reside in separate connectionist modules or \u2018sub-networks\u2019. Ultimately, it is argued that the basic tenets of connectionism, in conjunction with the fact that humans often employ novel combinations of skill modules in rule following and problem solving, lead to the plausible conclusion that, in certain domains, high level cognition requires some form of classical architecture. During the course of argument, it emerges that only an architecture with classical structure could support the novel patterns of information flow and interaction that would exist among the relevant set of modules. Such a classical architecture might very well reside in the abstract levels of a hybrid system whose lower-level modules are purely connectionist.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1023/A:1008347616489", "venue": "Minds and Machines", "journal": "Minds and Machines", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1586458171", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["171076366", "143637046", "29043627", "5592246", "8800782", "142305290", "9921081", "9484437", "15238917", "770011", "14973656", "197660420", "16361480", "14498946"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21953368"}

Virtual network mapping is the main method to realize the network virtualization. Most of the current virtual network mappings always allocate network resources in an exclusive and excessive way. For example, the entire bandwidth amount of the virtual network will be allocated according to its peak demand of the traffic. However, the truth is that the actual traffic needs of virtual network are changing constantly throughout its lifetime, and the distribution of static mapping will inevitably lead to the underutilization of the assigned resource, high user cost as well as low carrier revenue. In order to solve the above problems, we need to predict the changes of virtual network's demands accurately and adjust the allocation of resources dynamically. In this paper, we propose a virtual network mapping method based on support vector machine (SVM) to dynamically allocate and adjust the network resources.

Therefore, in this paper, an expert system for EEG signal classification has been proposed.

This paper partly answers this criticism by demonstrating that effective solutions to certain problems in knowledge representation and limited inference can be found by adopting a connectionist approach. The paper presents a connectionist realization of semantic networks, that is, it describes how knowledge about concepts, their properties, and the hierarchical relationship between them may be encoded as an interpreter-free massively parallel network of simple processing elements that can solve an interesting class of inheritance and recognition problems extremely fast\u2014in time proportional to the depth of the conceptual hierarchy. The connectionist realization is based on an evidential formulation that leads to principled solutions to the problems of exceptions and conflicting multiple inheritance situations during inheritance, and the best-match or partial-match computation during recognition.

To solve the high computation complexity of IPMML, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is performed before IPMML. Thus, a face recognition method based on LBP and IPMML is proposed, which can overcome the illumination and misalignment problems. LBP is selected to extract texture features of face images firstly.

In mammals, the degeneracy of the motif combined with the lack of a large set of experimentally verified BPs complicates the task of modeling it in silico, and therefore of predicting the location of natural BPs. Consequently, BPs have been disregarded in a considerable fraction of the genome-wide studies on the regulation of splicing in mammals. We present a new computational approach for mammalian BP prediction. Using sequence conservation and positional bias we obtained a set of motifs with good agreement with U2 snRNA binding stability. Using a Support Vector Machine algorithm, we created a model complemented with polypyrimidine tract features, which considerably improves the prediction accuracy over previously published methods. Applying our algorithm to human introns, we show that BP position is highly dependent on the presence of AG dinucleotides in the 3\u2032 end of introns, with distance to the 3\u2032 splice site and BP strength strongly correlating with alternative splicing. Furthermore, experimental BP mapping for five exons preceded by long AG-dinucleotide exclusion zones revealed that, for a given intron, more than one BP can be chosen throughout the course of splicing. Finally, the comparison between exons of different evolutionary ages and pseudo exons suggests a key role of the BP in the pathway of exon creation in human. Our computational and experimental analyses suggest that BP recognition is more flexible than previously assumed, and it appears highly dependent on the presence of downstream polypyrimidine tracts.

For comparison purposes, the approach is applied also to /pa/ and /ta/ syllables. In order to develop and validate the system, a voice recording database composed of 27 individuals diagnosed with PD and 27 healthy controls has been collected.

System design is based on feature extraction, feature selection and Support Vector Machine learning. Results: The novel VOT algorithm, based on a simple and computationally efficient approach, demonstrates accurate estimation of VOT boundaries on /ka/ syllables for both healthy and PD-affected speakers. The PD detection approach based on /k/ plosive consonant achieves the highest discrimination capability (92.2% using 10-fold cross-validation and 94.4% in the case of leave-one-out method) in comparison to the corresponding versions based on the other two plosives (/p/ and /t/).

Objective To evaluate whether phone sensor data and machine learning models are useful to detect alcohol use events, and to discuss implications of these results for just-in-time mobile interventions. Methods 38 non-treatment seeking young adult heavy drinkers downloaded AWARE app (which continuously collected mobile phone sensor data), and reported alcohol consumption (number of drinks, start/end time of prior day's drinking) for 28 days. We tested various machine learning models using the 20 most informative sensor features to classify time periods as non-drinking, low-risk (1 to 3/4 drinks per occasion for women/men), and high-risk drinking (> 4/5 drinks per occasion for women/men). Results Among 30 participants in the analyses, 207 non-drinking, 41 low-risk, and 45 high-risk drinking episodes were reported. A Random Forest model using 30-min windows with 1 day of historical data performed best for detecting high-risk drinking, correctly classifying high-risk drinking windows 90.9% of the time. The most informative sensor features were related to time (i.e., day of week, time of day), movement (e.g., change in activities), device usage (e.g., screen duration), and communication (e.g., call duration, typing speed).

The Kalman-filter approach yields an interpretable model, in which a small number of player-dependent parameters can be fit; in theory this could be used to distinguish among players. The Generative-Adversarial-Nets approach appears promising in theory, and some initial tests showed an improvement with respect to the baseline, but the limits in time and computational power meant that we could not fully explore it. We also trained a Discriminator network to distinguish between two players based on their trajectories; after training, the network managed to distinguish between some pairs of players, but not between others. After training, the Variational Autoencoders generated trajectories that are difficult to distinguish, visually, from the data. These experiments provide an indication that deep generative models can learn the underlying structure and statistics of football players' trajectories.

The potential use of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data was explored in this study for deriving landslide-conditioning factors for the spatial prediction of landslide-susceptible areas in a landslide-prone area in Ulu Klang, Malaysia. Nine landslide-conditioning factors, such as altitude, slope, aspect, curvature, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), terrain roughness index (TRI), sediment transport index (STI), and slope length (SL), were directly derived from LiDAR for landslide-susceptibility mapping. The main objective of this research was to propose a novel ensemble landslide susceptibility mapping method to enhance the performance of individual methods of support vector machine (SVM) and evidential belief function (EBF). SVM is time-consuming when various data types, such as nominal, scale, and ordinal, are used. This characteristic of the individual SVM method is not optimal for hazard modeling. This drawback can be resolved by assessing the effects of the classes of each conditioning factor on landslide occurrence through a data-driven EBF method. Hence, EBF was applied in this study, and weights were acquired for the classes of each conditioning factor. The conditioning factors were reclassified based on the attained weights and entered into SVM as a scale to evaluate the correlation between landslide occurrence and each conditioning factor. Four SVM kernel types [radial basis function kernel (RBF), sigmoid kernel (SIG), linear kernel (LN), and polynomial kernel (PL)] were tested to explore the efficiency of each kernel in SVM modeling. The efficiencies of the ensemble EBF and SVM methods were examined through area under curve (AUC). The RBF kernel obtained better results than the other kernel types. The success and prediction rates obtained from the validation results of ensemble EBF and RBF\u2013SVM method were 83.04% and 80.04%, respectively.

Although Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the most powerful forecasting approaches, it does not provide an interpretable model. This motivates penalized variable selection methods to be introduced to SVM to select important variables. However, in some forecasting problems, there are some underlying logic or hierarchical structure such as heredity principle among the variables. Penalized Kernel SVM approaches do not take heredity principles into consideration when enforcing sparsity. This paper investigates structural variable selection in Kernel SVM based approach which pursues heredity principle and sparsity simultaneously. To achieve heredity principle, both optimization and procedure based structural variable selection approaches are studied in the Kernel SVM. Computationally, we derive fast and simple-to-implement algorithms to perform structural variable selection and solar irradiance forecasting. Furthermore, Support Vector Machines Information Criterion is utilized to select the kernel parameters to guarantee the model consistency.

The purpose of this research is to study alternative way of measuring the emission gases using artificial intelligence prediction method called support vector machine. This research will concentrate on the prediction of NOx only, one of the flue gasses emitted by power generation plant. The research approach is by collecting the data from gas turbine parameters such as inlet guide vane position, compressor inlet temperature, gas control valves position, NOx reading from CEMS and many more. The data will be run for supervised learning and creating a model to predict NOx emission. The prediction models used for this study were radial basis function and polynomial. The predicted results were compared with the reading from the CEMS and the percentage average of accuracy recorded was 98.14% for radial basis function model and 96.95% using polynomial model. The result shows that the prediction method to predict NOx is reliable and accurate.

First, a fuzzy set is introduced, and an atom attribute fuzzy granulation is performed on samples in the classified system to form fuzzy granules. Then, a fuzzy granule vector is created by multiple attribute fuzzy granules. We design the operators and define the measure of fuzzy granule vectors in the fuzzy granule space. And we also prove the monotonic principle of the distance of fuzzy granule vectors. Furthermore, we also give the definition of the concept of K-nearest neighbor fuzzy granule vector and present FGKNN algorithm and BFGKNN algorithm. Finally, we compare the performance among KNN, Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), FGKNN and BFGKNN on UCI data sets. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that FGKNN and BFGKNN have better performance than that of the methods mentioned above if the appropriate parameters are given.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.knosys.2020.105606", "venue": null, "journal": "Knowledge Based Systems", "mag_id": "3005084809", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213864369"}

Objective: The aims were to describe how to: (i) develop machine learning classifiers using features generated by natural language processing tools to distinguish descriptions produced by healthy individuals into classes based on their years of education; and (ii) automatically identify the features that best distinguish the groups. Methods: The approach proposed here extracts linguistic features automatically from the written descriptions with the aid of two Natural Language Processing tools: Coh-Metrix-Port and AIC. It also includes nine task-specific features (three new ones, two extracted manually, besides description time; type of scene described - simple or complex; presentation order - which type of picture was described first; and age). In this study, the descriptions by 144 of the subjects studied in Toledo 18 were used, which included 200 healthy Brazilians of both genders.

To tackle this problem, we develop a secure protocol for multiple parties to conduct the desired computation. The solution is distributed, i.e., there is no central, trusted party having access to all the data. Instead, we deflne a protocol using homomorphic encryption techniques to exchange the data while keeping it private.

However, Alzheimer's disease involves many genes, and conducting experiments to find a disease-related gene is costly.

The present study aims to find a disease-related gene using random forest and to compare the results with previous medical research. In doing so, genes are determined to be disease-related using two methods. With random forest, we use the microarray data from GEO data sets. We feature a common gene in each data and combine them into a data set. A gene that has high importance is chosen. Random forest found 51 genes. In contrast, from previous medical science research, the study found 6167 genes. The study used the square of the impact factor to rank the genes. The impact factor is gained from the average number of citations received per paper published in that journal during the two preceding years. Based on the results from random forest and comparison with previous studies, we found 31 genes that are the same. Four of these genes are related to the GENE database, and the remaining 27 genes are related potential genes or unknown genes found in this study. The high ranking among them are considered to be very likely related. A low-ranking gene should also be considered. Genes in which the first method has been extracted.

The growth of cascades over time signal the popularity or lack thereof of the subject matter. In this work, we pose the question of whether the same feature set can be used for cascade growth prediction of any dataset on Twitter. We find evidence that features governing the cascade growth vary from one dataset to another. We first devise a definition of structural and temporal growth. Then, we propose an approach to select the best of these features based on the dataset for better accuracy results. We examine two types of growth prediction: structural and temporal. We use both Random Forest and Multilayer Perceptron as our models for growth prediction on data sets of two political campaigns in Egypt. The campaigns were concurrent in time, and were rallying for opposite causes, with a noticeable difference in societal popularity.

Several methods of automated diagnoses of causes of death from standardized verbal autopsy questionnaires have been developed recently (Inter-VA, Tariff, Random Forest and King-Lu). Their performances have been assessed in a series of papers in BMC Medicine. Overall, and despite high specificity, the current strategies of automated computer diagnoses lead to relatively low sensitivity and positive predictive values, even for causes which are expected to be easily assessed by interview. Some methods have even abnormally low sensitivity for selected diseases of public health importance and could probably be improved. Ways to improve the current strategies are proposed: more detailed questionnaires; using more information on disease duration; stratifying for large groups of causes of death by age, sex and main category; using clusters of signs and symptoms rather than quantitative scores or ranking; separating indeterminate causes; imputing unknown cause with appropriate methods.

Here, we investigated the potential of mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIRS) to predict SR and Q10 values for 124 soil samples of diverse land use types taken from a 2868 km 2 catchment (Rur catchment, Germany/Belgium/Netherlands). Soil respiration at standardized temperature (25 \u00b0C) and soil moisture (45% of maximum water holding capacity, WHC) was successfully predicted by MIRS coupled with partial least square regression (PLSR, R 2 = 0.83). Also the Q10 value was predictable by MIRS-PLSR for a grassland submodel (R 2 = 0.75) and a cropland submodel (R 2 = 0.72) but not for forested sites (R 2 = 0.03). In order to provide soil respiration estimates for arbitrary conditions of temperature and soil moisture, more flexible models are required that can handle nonlinear and interacting relations. Therefore, we applied a Random Forest model, which includes the MIRS spectra, temperature, soil moisture, and land use as predictor variables. We could show that SR can be simultaneously predicted for any temperature (5\u201325 \u00b0C) and soil moisture level (30\u201375% of WHC), indicated by a high R 2 of 0.73.

But different sensors equipped in the system may sample data at different sampling rates, which will inevitably result in a problem that a very small number of samples with a complete structure can be used for deep learning since the input of a deep neural network (DNN) is required to be a structurally complete sample. On the other hand, a large number of samples are required to ensure the efficiency of deep learning based fault diagnosis methods. To solve the problem that a structurally complete sample size is too small, this paper proposes a fault diagnosis framework of missing data based on transfer learning which makes full use of a large number of structurally incomplete samples. By designing suitable transfer learning mechanisms, extra useful fault features can be extracted to improve the accuracy of fault diagnosis based simply on structural complete samples. Thus, online fault diagnosis, as well as an offline learning scheme based on deep learning of multi-rate sampling data, can be developed.

Previously we successfully distinguished the general proteomic signature of genuine chromosomal proteins from hitchhikers using the Random Forests (RF) machine learning algorithm. Here we test whether small protein complexes can define distinguishable signatures of their own, despite the assumption that machine learning needs large training sets. We show, with simulated and real proteomics data, that RF can detect small protein complexes and relationships between them. We identify several complexes in quantitative proteomics results of wild-type and knockout mitotic chromosomes. Other proteins covary strongly with these complexes, suggesting novel functional links for later study. Integrating the RF analysis for several complexes reveals known interdependences among kinetochore subunits and a novel dependence between the inner kinetochore and condensin.

{"paper_id": "79567290", "title": "Design and evaluation of analytical tools for emergency department management based on machine learning techniques", "authors": [{"first": "Alexander", "middle": [], "last": "Zlotnik Enaliev", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "The Spanish National Healthcare System (NHS) is mostly publicly funded and provided. It is considered highly cost-efficient according to international studies based on World Health Organization (WHO) data. However, the contention of healthcare costs increases while maintaining adequate levels of quality of care, is still a largely unsolved problem. In recent years, Emergency Departments (EDs) of specialized care hospitals have been subjected to budget restrictions, increased visits and increased clinical complexity of these visits. These circumstances require new approaches to ED management, which could benefit from decision support tools. ::: In this Ph.D. thesis, we propose machine learning solutions for two problems common to most EDs of specialized care hospitals: ED census forecasting and real-time prediction of probabilities of inpatient admission for all triaged patients in the ED. These solutions could be used as decision support systems. Data for the development of these solutions were provided by the Ramon y Cajal University Hospital of Madrid, a large specialized care referral center with all medical specialties excepting Obstetrics. In years 2011 and 2012 it had approximately 1,100 beds and approximately 553,000 patients assigned to its clinical area. Another topic of this Ph.D. thesis are software tools for the generation of logistic regression and Cox regression nomograms, since nomograms can be used as clinical decision aids and as contingency procedures in case of failure of computer-based decision support systems. ::: The first topic of this Ph.D. thesis is the development of models for ED census forecasting (i.e. prediction of the number of patients present at the ED at a given time). One of the uses of ED census forecasting is nursing personnel allocation, based on national and international recommendations. We chose an 8-hour granularity for our forecasts since many resources (such as nursing personnel) in the ED are organized in 8-hour shifts. Our aim was to generate forecasts for two dependent variables: average ED census levels and maximum ED census levels. Maximum ED census forecasts within 8-hour shifts could be used for nursing personnel allocation, while average ED census forecasts within 8-hour shifts could be used for the other needs (such as allocation of administrative personnel). ::: We used a generalized regression approach to time series forecasting with several machine learning algorithms: M5P, Alternating Model Trees (AMT) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). We compared these to a series of benchmarks: usual nursing staffing levels (and usual resource allocation policies), stratified average (averages stratified by the three 8-hour shifts of a day), linear regression and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models. Forecasts were generated for both dependent variables: average ED census levels and maximum ED census levels. Four forecast horizons were tested: 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks. Underestimation risks, overestimation risks and approximations to monetary costs of resource allocations policies were defined for both average and maximum ED census forecasts. Maximum ED census forecasts were transformed into nursing personnel levels, and underestimation and overestimation risks for maximum ED census forecasts were transformed into understaffing and overstaffing risks. A custom training and evaluation scheme was used, with increasingly larger train sets and fixed-length test sets. The same scheme but with fixed-length train sets of 1 year and fixed-length test sets was also used. The latter approach did not improve the results. ::: In the case of maximum ED census forecasts, M5P was the best choice for the reduction of major and medium nursing personnel understaffing risks, for all forecast horizons. Compared to the usual staffing levels, personnel planning with M5P could reduce major understaffing (>9 nurse) risks more than 10-fold (a reduction to ~1% with M5P compared to ~13% obtained with the usual nurse staffing levels); and could reduce medium understaffing (7-9 nurses) risks approximately 3-fold (a reduction to ~3% with M5P compared to ~10% obtained with the usual staffing levels). The usage of M5P also implied 5% - 6.1% increases in estimated nursing personnel costs (compared to the usual staffing levels), which are acceptable given the large reductions in understaffing risks. ::: In the case of average ED census forecasts, once again, M5P was the best choice for the reduction of major and medium underestimation risks, for all forecast horizons. Relative risk reductions were similar to those of maximum ED census forecasts (more than 10-fold reduction in major underestimation and approximately 3-fold reduction in medium underestimation, compared to usual resource allocation policies). However, in this case, the usual resource allocation policies already had low risks of major and medium underestimation (~2% risk of major underestimation and ~3.7% risk of medium underestimation). On the other hand, most importantly, in the case of average ED census forecasts, M5P led to a cost reduction of more than 15% compared to the usual resource allocation policies. ::: The second topic of this Ph.D. thesis is the development of models for real-time prediction of probabilities of inpatient admission from the ED. Our aim in this case was the development of classifiers with adequate performance in terms of both discrimination and calibration (goodness-of-fit), reliant on a small number of variables, available in most ED settings right after triage. In our setting, the Manchester Triage System (MTS) was used. Discrimination was evaluated with the area under the ROC curve (AUROC). Calibration was evaluated with Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) \u03c72 and p-values with 10 fixed probability intervals. We used logistic regression (LR) models, artificial neural networks (ANN) models and models based on an ad hoc ensemble classifier that optimized calibration (it combined a LR model with a tree of MTS chief complaints with LogitBoost on its leaves). A custom method was used for the evaluation of models, with increasingly larger train sets and 12 consecutive test sets of approximately monthly length. This evaluation method produced the results that follow, reported with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). For LR models, average AUROC = 0.8531, 95% CI (0.8501, 0.8561); for ANN models, average AUROC = 0.8568, 95% CI (0.8531, 0.8606) and for ad hoc ensemble classifier models, average AUROC = 0.8635, 95% CI (0.8605, 0.8665). Confidence intervals of average AUROCs for LR and ad hoc ensemble classifier models did not overlap. Confidence intervals of average AUROCs for LR and ANN models slightly overlapped, although ANN models had higher AUROCs than LR models in all but one of the 12 test sets. Average H-L \u03c72 were, respectively, 35.15, 95% CI (32.57, 37.73) for LR models, 10.47, 95% CI (7.78, 13.17) for ANN models and 11.4, 95% CI (9.10, 13.75) for ad hoc ensemble classifier models. Both ANN and ad hoc ensemble classifier models possessed better calibration than LR models, with H-L p-values>0.05 in 10 of the 12 experiments. ::: The third topic of this Ph.D thesis is the development and evaluation of software for the generation of logistic and Cox regression nomograms. We developed two programs (nomolog and nomocox) for these purposes, based on Stata (a statistical software package widely used in biomedical research). At the time of the writing of this Ph.D. thesis these programs are used by an international community of researchers in the fields of clinical medicine, epidemiology or biostatistics. We surveyed some of these users about their background, their user experience with nomolog and nomocox, as well as the ease-of-use and flexibility of our programs compared to those available in R (another well-known statistical software). Most respondents were \u201cPromoters\u201d (Net Promoter Score > 8), i.e. very likely to recommend the software to other researchers. All respondents (100%) who had used both our programs (nomolog and nomocox) and nomogram generators available for the R statistical software, found nomocox and nomolog easier to use; with a 95% adjusted Wald CI (75.83%, 100%). A raw proportion of 81.25%, with a 95% adjusted Wald CI (54.03%, 96.36%) found our programs to be more flexible than the nomogram generators available for the R statistical software.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.20868/upm.thesis.43029", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2769126794", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:79567290"}

There are no effective quantitative methods for detecting \u00b11-steganography, therefore, the most popular ones are ordinary methods Support Vector Machine and Linear Discriminant Analysis, which are able to detect up to 0.1 bpp. These methods are also can be applied to LSB-replacement and are able to detect the embedding up to 0.01 bpp. In the current paper, a new scenario and a new quantitative method within this scenario are suggested. The scenario assumes that a Warden knows exact pixels, where the information is supposed to be embedded, and it can be implemented, for instance, in the following situation. Assume that the Warden is given a device which is used for the information embedding (a key can be already injected into it). The task is to detect whether a given image has some embedded information via this device, or not. It is experimentally shown that the new method allows to detect up to 0.001 bits-per-pixel embedding, that is much more than known methods.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "20230655", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:117421326"}

The difficulty of differentiation between malignant melanoma and melanocytic naive is the error-bone problem that usually faces the physicians in diagnosis. To think through the hard mission of pigmented skin lesions diagnosis different clinical diagnosis algorithms were proposed such as pattern analysis, ABCD rule of dermoscopy, Menzies method, and 7-points checklist. Computerized monitoring of these algorithms improves the diagnosis of melanoma compared to simple naked-eye of physician during examination. Toward the serious step of melanoma early detection, aiming to reduce melanoma mortality rate, several computerized studies and procedures were proposed. Through this research different approaches with a huge number of features were discussed to point out the best approach or methodology could be followed to accurately diagnose the pigmented skin lesion. This paper proposes automated system for diagnosis of melanoma to provide quantitative and objective evaluation of skin lesion as opposed to visual assessment, which is subjective in nature. Two different data sets were utilized to reduce the effect of qualitative interpretation problem upon accurate diagnosis. Set of clinical images that are acquired from a standard camera while the other set is acquired from a special dermoscopic camera and so named dermoscopic images. System contribution appears in new, complete and different approaches presented for the aim of pigmented skin lesion diagnosis. These approaches result from using large conclusive set of features fed to different classifiers. The three main types of different features extracted from the region of interest are geometric, chromatic, and texture features. Three statistical methods were proposed to select the most significant features that will cause a valuable effect in diagnosis; Fisher score method, t-test, and F-test. The selected features of high-ranking score based on the statistical methods are used for the diagnosis of the two lesion groups using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as three different classifiers proposed. The overall System performance was then measured in regards to Specificity, Sensitivity and Accuracy. According to the different approaches that will be mentioned later the best result was showen by the ANN designed with the feature selected according to fisher score method enables a diagnostic accuracy of 96.25% and 97% for dermoscopic and clinical images respectively.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.14569/IJACSA.2016.071033", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2548707967", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["70893256", "8604767", "4860343", "30366753", "17103130", "56135909", "13024251", "45490703", "533211", "768744", "63046180", "13000924", "30366753", "1023524", "60023173", "30515829", "16753088", "206786900", "124639692", "118861889", "18927855", "44708800", "122708979", "2914506", "10404259", "7138354", "1900499", "2460455", "2845602", "60486887", "1364381"], "inbound_citations": ["210971544", "208037738", "51706221", "51863641"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:41941413"}

The main focus was on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), an area of the brain known to signal mistakes as well as the level of difficulty or conflict facing the decision-maker. The research effort involved iteratively developing computational models and testing their predictions with fMRI, leading to further refinements of the model. The original goal of developing a model of risk prediction was achieved. Further effort yielded a more general model of how both good and bad potential consequences are learned and anticipated. The model predictions were validated by numerous behavioral and fMRI studies, and the effort also yielded an exact recursive model of hyperbolic temporal discounting. The results overall provide a new and relatively simple computational model of consequence prediction that accounts for and predicts a wide array of empirical data and is well-grounded in the known neurobiologically.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.21236/ada515423", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "8249623", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59822668"}

The classification performed by SCA is an essential component of the detection and analysis of various cardiac arrhythmic disorders, including ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. Given a digitized frame of a propagating wave, SCA constructs a highly accurate representation of the front and the back of the wave, piecewise interpolates this representation with cubic splines, and subjects the result to an accurate curvature analysis. This analysis is more comprehensive than methods based on spiral-tip tracking, as it considers the entire wave front and back. To increase the smoothness of the resulting symbolic representation, the SCA uses weighted overlapping of adjacent segments which increases the smoothness at join points. SCA has been applied to several representative types of spiral waves, and for each type, a distinct curvature evolution in time (signature) has been identified. Moreover, distinguished signatures have been also identified for spiral breakup. This represents a significant first step in automatically determining parameter ranges for which a computational cardiac-cell network accurately reproduces ventricular fibrillation.

This paper addresses two problems in MED: weakly supervised setting and unclear event structure. The first indicates that since associations of shots with the event are laborious and incur annotator\u2019s subjectivity, training videos are loosely annotated as to whether the event is contained or not. It is unknown which shots are relevant or irrelevant to the event. The second problem is the difficulty of assuming the event structure in advance, due to arbitrary camera and editing techniques. To tackle these problems, we propose a method using a Hidden Conditional Random Field (HCRF) which is a probabilistic discriminative classifier with a set of hidden states. We consider that the weakly supervised setting can be handled using hidden states as the intermediate layer to discriminate between relevant and irrelevant shots to the event. In addition, an unclear structure of the event can be exposed by features of each hidden state and its relation to the other states. Based on the above idea, we optimise hidden states and their relation so as to distinguish training videos containing the event from the others. Also, to exploit the full potential of HCRFs, we establish approaches for training video preparation, parameter initialisation and fusion of multiple HCRFs.

To this end, each video frame is divided into non- overlapping regions wherein a set of low-level features are extracted. After that, we apply the anomaly classifiers which determine whether there is anomaly in each region. We then derive the anomaly trajectory by connecting the anomalous regions temporarily across the video frames. Finally, we propose path prediction using linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) to smooth the trajectory. By doing this, we will able to better locate them in the crowded scene.

This research implements parallel and concatenation approach to ensemble classify the images. The multiclassifier system comprises of Maximum Likelihood, Support Vector Machines, and Spectral Information Divergence as base classifiers. Decision-level fusion is achieved by implementing plurality voting method. Pixel-level fusion is achieved by implementing fusion by mosaicking approach, thus appending cloud-free pixels from either Sentinel-2 or Landsat 7. The comparison is based on the assessment of classification accuracy. Overall accuracy results show that decision-level fusion achieved an accuracy of 85.4%, whereas pixel-level fusion classification attained 82.5%, but their respective kappa coefficients of 0.84 and 0.80 but are not significantly different according to Z-test at $\\alpha = {\\text{0.05}}$ . F1-score values reveal that decision-level performed better on most individual classes than pixel-level. Regression coefficient between planted areas from both approaches is 0.99. However, Support Vector Machines performed the best of the three classifiers. The conclusion is that both decision-level and pixel-level fusion approaches produced comparable classification results.

To overcome this issue, data normalization can be used to address the issue. Experiments have been made using existing normalization techniques such as Z-score, Minimax and libSVM scale function.

This paper addresses the question: can protein\u2013protein interactions be predicted directly from primary structure and associated data? Using a diverse database of known protein interactions, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning system was trained to recognize and predict interactions based solely on primary structure and associated physicochemical properties. Results: Inductive accuracy of the trained system, defined here as the percentage of correct protein interaction predictions for previously unseen test sets, averaged 80% for the ensemble of statistical experiments.

Our objective is helping software developers and testers to predict error-prone classes, eliminate design defects and reduce testing costs. In learning-based methods, the dataset that is used for training the model, strongly affects the accuracy of the detection system. Therefore, we focus on steps of constructing the proper dataset using different metrics collected from existing software projects. First, we consider the rate of errors generated by a class to label it as \"Clean\" or \"Buggy\". Secondly, we use CFS (Correlation-based Feature Selection) and the PCA (Principal Component Analysis) methods to obtain the most appropriate subset of metrics. This feature selection process increases the understandability and the detection performance of the model. Lastly, we apply the Random Forest classification method to determine error-prone classes. We evaluated our approach using five different datasets that include data collected from various open-source Eclipse subprojects. The results show that our approach is successful in building learning-based models for detecting error-prone classes.

First of all, the two orthogonal singular value decomposition matrixes of the typical leakage waveform are extracted as the standard bases. Then the projection singular value features of the other pressure wave matrixes are extracted by being projected to the two standard bases. As the pipeline leakage is a small probability event, it is difficult to obtain the leakage samples. A multi-classification Support Vector Machine, which has the advantage of small sample learning, is constructed to classify these features in this paper.

But CSMS is vulnerable to the soil temperature (T\"s) and salinity (S\"s) in the measurement process. Therefore, this study took EC-5 sensor for example to establish water detection calibration models of soil temperature and salinity for single sensor, using Least Squares Support Vector Machines on MatLAB (LS-SVMlab) as the tool. On this basis, we explored the spatial variability of T\"s and S\"s, and then a method, which could be used to calibrate the output signals of sensors in multi-point network, was proposed based on the information-sharing (T\"s or S\"s) technology of WSN. Through laboratory experiment, we effectively reduced the impact of soil temperature and salinity on the single sensor. In example analysis, we investigated the detection precision and costs under different information-sharing radiuses (r). And the results indicated that the method we proposed based on the information-sharing technology of WSN could successfully calibrate the influence of soil temperature and salinity on sensors in multi-point network, and it was an efficacious approach to determine the balance between the calibration accuracy of moisture sensor and the investment of agricultural production.

Globally, 10-20% of drylands and 24% of the world\u2019s productive lands are potentially degraded, which affects 1.5 billion people and reduces GDP by \u20ac3.4 billion. In Africa, LDD processes affect up to a third of savannahs, leading to a decline in the ecosystem services provided to some of the continent\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable communities. Indirectly, LDD can be monitored using relevant indicators. The encroachment of woody plants into grasslands, and the subsequent conversion of savannahs and open woodlands into shrublands, has attracted a lot of attention over the last decades and has been identified as an indicator of LDD. According to some assessments, bush encroachment has rendered 1.1 million ha of South African savanna unusable, threatens another 27 million ha (~17% of the country), and has reduced the grazing capacity throughout the region by up to 50%. Mapping woody cover encroachment over large areas can only be effectively achieved using remote sensing data and techniques. The longest continuously operating Earth-observation program, the Landsat series, is now freely-available as an atmospherically corrected, cloud masked surface reflectance product. The availability and length of the Landsat archive is thus an unparalleled Earth-observation resource, particularly for long-term change detection and monitoring. Here, we map and monitor woody vegetation cover in the Northwest Province of South Africa, a mosaic of 12 Landsat scenes that expands over more than 100,000km2. We employ a multi-temporal approach with dry-season TM, ETM+ and OLI data from 15 epochs between 1989 to 2015. We use 0.5m-pixel colour aerial photography to collect >15,000 samples for training and validating a Random Forest model to map woody cover, grasses, crops, urban and bare areas. High classification accuracies are achieved, especially so for the two cover types indirectly linked with bush encroachment, i.e. woody cover and grasses. Results show that there is a steady increase in woody vegetation cover over the 26-year-long period of study in the expense of graminoids. We identify woody vegetation encroachment \u2018hot-spots\u2019 where mitigation measures are required and thus provide a management tool for the prioritisation of such measures in degraded and food-insecure areas.

Choices need to be made for data set splitting, cross-validation methods, specific regression parameters and best model criteria, as they all affect the accuracy and efficiency of the produced predictive models, and therefore, raising model reproducibility and comparison issues. Cheminformatics and bioinformatics are extensively using predictive modelling and exhibit a need for standardization of these methodologies in order to assist model selection and speed up the process of predictive model development. A tool accessible to all users, irrespectively of their statistical knowledge, would be valuable if it tests several simple and complex regression models and validation schemes, produce unified reports, and offer the option to be integrated into more extensive studies. Additionally, such methodology should be implemented as a free programming package, in order to be continuously adapted and redistributed by others. We propose an integrated framework for creating multiple regression models, called RRegrs. The tool offers the option of ten simple and complex regression methods combined with repeated 10-fold and leave-one-out cross-validation. Methods include Multiple Linear regression, Generalized Linear Model with Stepwise Feature Selection, Partial Least Squares regression, Lasso regression, and Support Vector Machines Recursive Feature Elimination. The new framework is an automated fully validated procedure which produces standardized reports to quickly oversee the impact of choices in modelling algorithms and assess the model and cross-validation results. The methodology was implemented as an open source R package, available at https://www.github.com/enanomapper/RRegrs, by reusing and extending on the caret package. The universality of the new methodology is demonstrated using five standard data sets from different scientific fields. Its efficiency in cheminformatics and QSAR modelling is shown with three use cases: proteomics data for surface-modified gold nanoparticles, nano-metal oxides descriptor data, and molecular descriptors for acute aquatic toxicity data. The results show that for all data sets RRegrs reports models with equal or better performance for both training and test sets than those reported in the original publications.

To make learnt nonlinear features be optimal for classification so that the accuracy can be enhanced, we also minimize a robust L2,1-norm based regressive classification error over the embedded manifold features, which ensures the classification process to be robust to noise and outliers in data.

To counterbalance the slowness of SVMs on large datasets, three simple and fast methods for reducing the size of the training data, and thus speeding up the SVMs are incorporated. One is blind random sampling. The other two are new linear-time methods for guided random sampling which we call Gaussian Condensing and Gaussian Smoothing. In spite of the speedups of SVMs obtained by incorporating Gaussian Smoothing and Condensing, the results obtained show that k-NN methods are superior to SVMs on most of the seven data sets used, and cast doubt on the general superiority of SVMs. Furthermore, random sampling works surprisingly well and is robust, suggesting that it is a worthwhile preprocessing step to either SVMs or k-NN.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-25530-9_8", "venue": "ICPRAM", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2293389223", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7044530"}

Neurocognitive interventions (NCIs) have emerged in the last two decades as a strong potential supplementary treatment option to improve cognitive deficits and drop in functioning affecting patients with PSD. Social cognitive training (SCT) involving e.g., facial stimuli, has gained considerably more attention in recent studies than computerized NCIs, that use basic visual or auditory stimuli. This is due to the complex character of social cognition (SC) that draws on multiple brain structures involved in behaviors and perception beyond default cognitive function. SC is also tightly interlinked with psychosocial functioning. Although they are cost-effective and quite independent of clinical staff, such technological approaches as SCT are currently not integrated into routine clinical practice. Recent studies have mapped the effects of SCT in task-based studies on multiple brain regions such as the amygdala, putamen, medial prefrontal cortex, and postcentral gyrus (Ramsay & MacDonald III, 2015). Yet, the degree to which alterations in brain function are associated with response to such interventions is still poorly understood. Importantly, resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) may be a viable neuromarker as it has shown greater sensitivity in distinguishing patients from healthy controls (HC) across neuroimaging studies, and is relatively easy to administer especially in patients with acute symptoms (Kambeitz et al., 2015). In this dissertation, we employed 1) a univariate statistical approach to elucidate the efficacy of a 10-hour SCT in improving cognition, symptoms, functioning and the restoration of rsFC in patients undergoing SCT as compared to the treatment as usual (TAU) group, and 2) multivariate methods. In particular, we used a Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach to neuromonitor the recovery of rsFC in the SCT group compared to TAU. We also investigated the potential utility of rsFC as a baseline (T0) neuromarker viable of predicting role functioning approximately 2 months later. First, current findings suggest a 10-hour SCT has the capability of improving role functioning in recent-onset psychosis (ROP) patients. Second, we have shown intervention-specific rsFC changes within parts of default mode and social cognitive network. Moreover, patients with worse SC performance at T0 showed greater rsFC changes following the intervention, suggestive of a greater degree of rsFC restoration potential in patients with worse social cognitive deficits. Third, when referring to neuromonitoring results, it is important to state that only greater transition from ROP to \u201cHC-like\u201d SVM decision scores, based on the resting-state modality, was paralleled by intervention specific significantly greater improvement in global cognition and attention. Finally, we were able to show the early prediction of good versus poor role functioning is feasible at the individual subject level using a rsFC-based linear SVM classifier with a Balanced Accuracy (BAC) of 74 %. This dissertation sheds light on the effects and feasibility of a relatively short computerized SCT, and the potential utility of multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) for better clinical stratification of predicted treatment response based on rsFC neuromarkers.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2966537660", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201187764"}

Our scheme differs from existing malware detection methods based on virtualization technology in three aspects. First, this paper combines VMI with MFA to extract multiple type features in the guest virtual machine at the same time. Our scheme can effectively minimize the data acquisition overhead. Second,compared with single dynamic feature or multiple static feature detection methods, our data acquisition method employs dynamic multiple type features, and effectively promotes the ability of sophisticated malware detection.

This paper is a supplement to existing approaches in the field of in situ and real-time laser-quality monitoring that presents a novel combination of state-of-the-art sensors and machine learning for data processing. The investigations were carried out using laser welding of titanium workpieces. The quality was estimated a posteriori by the visual inspection of cross-sections of the welded joints. Four quality categories were defined to cover the two main laser welding regimes: conduction and keyhole. The signals from the laser back reflection and optical and acoustic emissions were recorded during the laser welding process and were decomposed with the $M$ -band wavelets. The relative energies of narrow frequency bands were taken as descriptive features. The correlation of the extracted features with the laser welding quality was carried out using the Laplacian graph support vector machine classifier. Also, an adaptive kernel for the classifier was developed to improve the analysis of the distributions of the complex features and was constructed from Gaussian mixtures. The presented laser welding setup and the developed adaptive kernel algorithm were able to classify the quality for every $2~\\mu \\text{m}$ of the welded joint with an accuracy ranged between 85.9% and 99.9%.

Based on the fact that adversaries rely on network linkmap to launch LFA, in this paper, we propose an active LFA mitigation mechanism, called Linkbait, that actively mitigates LFA by providing a fake linkmap to adversaries. Inspired by Moving Target Defense (MTD), we propose a link obfuscation algorithm in Linkbait that selectively reroutes detecting flows to hide target links from adversaries and mislead them to consider some bait links as target links. By providing the faked linkmap to adversaries, Linkbait can actively mitigate LFA even without identifying bots and does not affect flows from legitimate hosts. In order to further reduce the junk traffic generated by adversaries from entering the network, we propose a bot detection algorithm in Linkbait that extracts unique traffic patterns from LFA and leverages Support Vector Machine to accurately distinguish bots from legitimate hosts.

This report investigates the likely range changes of both sand fly species in response to a stabilisation climate change scenario (RCP4.5) and a high greenhouse gas emissions one (RCP8.5).MethodsEcological niche modelling was used to identify areas of South America with climates currently suitable for each species, and then the future distributions of these climates were predicted based on climate change scenarios. Compared with the previous ecological niche model of L. intermedia (sensu lato) produced using the GARP algorithm in 2003, the current investigation modelled the two species separately, making use of verified presence records and additional records after 2001. Also, the new ensemble approach employed ecological niche modelling algorithms (including Maximum Entropy, Random Forests and Support Vector Machines) that have been widely adopted since 2003 and perform better than GARP, as well as using a more recent climate change model (HadGEM2) considered to have better performance at higher resolution than the earlier one (HadCM2).ResultsLutzomyia intermedia was shown to be the more tropical of the two species, with its climatic niche defined by higher annual mean temperatures and lower temperature seasonality, in contrast to the more subtropical L. neivai. These different latitudinal ranges explain the two species' predicted responses to climate change by 2050, with L. intermedia mostly contracting its range (except perhaps in northeast Brazil) and L. neivai mostly shifting its range southwards in Brazil and Argentina.

Messoghia, a predominantly rural area, experienced significant and unregulated urban growth, during the past decades, due to the construction of the international airport in the area, the significant allocation of funds triggered by 2004 Olympics and the absence of planning controls.

Objective This study investigates methods for developing a high-quality reference corpus for the de-identification of clinical documents in French. Methods A corpus comprising a variety of clinical document types covering several medical specialties was pre-processed with two automatic de-identification systems from the MEDINA suite of tools: a rule-based system and a system using Conditional Random Fields (CRF). The pre-annotated documents were revised by two human annotators trained to mark ten categories of Protected Health Information (PHI). The human annotators worked independently and were blind to the system that produced the pre-annotations they were revising. The best pre-annotation system was applied to another random selection of 100 documents. After revision by one annotator, this set was used to train a statistical de-identification system. Results Two gold standard sets of 100 documents were created based on the consensus of two human revisions of the automatic pre-annotations. The annotation experiment showed that (i) automatic pre-annotation obtained with the rule-based system performed better (F = 0.813) than the CRF system (F = 0.519), (ii) the human annotators spent more time revising the pre-annotations obtained with the rule-based system (from 102 to 160 minutes for 50 documents), compared to the CRF system (from 93 to 142 minutes for 50 documents), (iii) the quality of human annotation is higher when pre-annotations are obtained with the rule-based system (F-measure ranging from 0.970 to 0.987), compared to the CRF system (F-measure ranging from 0.914 to 0.981). Finally, only 20 documents from the training set were needed for the statistical system to outperform the pre-annotation systems that were trained on corpora from a medical speciality and hospital different from those in the reference corpus developed herein. Conclusion We find that better pre-annotations increase the quality of the reference corpus but require more revision time. A statistical de-identification method outperforms our rule-based system when as little as 20 custom training documents are available.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "24380818", "doi": "10.1016/j.jbi.2013.12.014", "venue": "Journal of biomedical informatics", "journal": "Journal of biomedical informatics", "mag_id": "2045718189", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["21726434", "4039842", "49314943", "199448266", "27659311", "4855944", "14540784", "32163170", "49428854", "162436", "53080812", "21427755", "5020000", "21640862"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:22823278"}

Indeed, the typical phases needed for a computer-aided detection (CAD) program are shown in Fig. 7.1. The first operations aim to reduce the noise of the digital mammogram and to isolate suspicious lesions. After that, a feature extraction step is usually carried out. Automatic feature extraction procedures utilize image analysis techniques for the computation of feature vectors characteristic of the segmented lesions. Typically, the lesions are then identified, or characterized, by exploiting the information of the calculated features. Then, a classification phase is performed, where the extracted features are provided as inputs to a classifier. In detection schemes, this phase is known as false-positive reduction. Here, it is necessary to set up a classifier that, hopefully, maintains all the true detected signals, and at the same time, rejects almost all the false positive signals. For diagnosis schemes, this phase aims to characterize the lesion as benign or malignant, on the basis of its features. Several types of classifiers have been investigated, such as artificial neural networks, linear discriminant analysis, and decision trees. Most of the techniques are supervised methods. ::: ::: Recently, a new family of classifiers has appeared in CAD schemes: the support vector machine (SVM). SVMs have been introduced as a technique that relies on statistical learning theory (SLT). Whereas other techniques, e.g., multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), are based on the minimization of the empirical risk, which is the minimization of the number of misclassified vectors of the training set, where SVMs minimize a function that is the sum of two terms. The first term is the empirical risk, the second term (confidence term) controls the ability of the machine to learn any training set without error. SVMs are attracting increasing attention because they rely on a solid statistical foundation and appear to perform quite effectively in many different applications. After training, the separating surface is expressed as a certain linear combination of a given kernel function centered at some of the data vectors (named support vectors). All the remaining vectors of the training set are effectively discarded and the classification of new vectors is obtained solely in terms of the support vectors (SVs). Usually, the smaller the percentage of SVs, the better the generalization of the machine. The interpretative key lies in the fact that, for SVMs, the modeling of the classes is based on the properties of the example vectors at the boundary edge between the two classes. Indeed, what the SVM adds to the other classifiers is a better check of the boundary cases, the ones where it is more difficult to decide whether they belong to one class or to the other. Since it has a sample of examples representing the distribution at the edges of the two classes, the SVM uses these examples for drawing a boundary map between the classes. In this way, much fewer examples are required for carrying out generalizations than would be necessary if it was required to model the entire distribution of the vectors of the class in order to draw out the mean properties. SVMs have been used both in detection and in diagnosis tasks. In both cases, the SVM acts as a classifier that tends to separate two classes of objects: lesions and nonlesions in detection schemes, and benign and malignant (or normal and abnormal) in diagnostic programs. Several studies have demonstrated that in most conditions, the SVM classifier, thanks to its properties, outperforms other type of classifiers.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/3.651880.ch7", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2493241612", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:124876709"}

In our fusion learning paradigm, fused output is a linear combination of multiple classifiers or ranked streams. The algorithm is inspired from Ensemble Learning [2] but takes that idea further for improving generalization capability. A key application of our fusion learning algorithm, described in this work, is semantics reinforcement using an ensemble of classifiers built using the same training dataset but groundtruth corresponding to different concepts. We expect that classifiers built for semantically close concepts should reinforce each other's performance and fusion learning is an excellent post-classification way to reinforce semantics and performance. Fusion learning experiments have been performed on TRECVID 2005 test set.

The information dense, complex spectra generate massive datasets in which subtle correlations may provide critical clues for biological analysis and pathological classification. Therefore, implementing advanced data mining techniques is imperative for complete, rapid and accurate spectral processing. Numerous recent studies have employed various data methods to Raman spectra for classification and biochemical analysis. Although, as Raman datasets from biological specimens are often characterized by high dimensionality and low sample numbers, many of these classification models are subject to overfitting. Furthermore, attempts to reduce dimensionality result in transformed feature spaces making the biological evaluation of significant and discriminative spectral features problematic. We have developed a novel data mining framework optimized for Raman datasets, called Fisher-based Feature Selection Support Vector Machines (FFS-SVM). This framework provides simultaneous supervised classification and user-defined Fisher criterion-based feature selection, reducing overfitting and directly yielding significant wavenumbers from the original feature space. Herein, we investigate five cancerous and non-cancerous breast cell lines using Raman microspectroscopy and our unique FFS-SVM framework. Our framework classification performance is then compared to several other frequently employed classification methods on four classification tasks. The four tasks were constructed by an unsupervised clustering method yielding the four different categories of cell line groupings (e.g. cancer vs non-cancer) studied. FFS-SVM achieves both high classification accuracies and the extraction of biologically significant features. The top ten most discriminative features are discussed in terms of cell-type specific biological relevance. Our framework provides comprehensive cellular level characterization and could potentially lead to the discovery of cancer biomarker-type information, which we have informally termed \u2018Raman-based spectral biomarkers\u2019. The FFS-SVM framework along with Raman spectroscopy will be used in future studies to investigate in-situ dynamic biological phenomena.

This challenge is often due to a lack of literate speakers of the language, or in extreme cases, a lack of universally acknowledged orthography as well. One solution is to increase the amount of labeled data by using mismatched transcription, which employs transcribers who do not speak the underresourced language of interest called the target language (in place of native speakers), to transcribe what they hear as nonsense speech in their own annotation language ( $\\ne$ target language). Previous uses of mismatched transcription converted it to a probabilistic transcription (PT), but PT is limited by the errors of nonnative perception. This paper proposes, instead, a multitask learning framework in which one deep neural network (DNN) is trained to optimize two separate tasks: acoustic modeling of a small number of matched transcription with matched target-language graphemes; and acoustic modeling of a large number of mismatched transcription with mismatched annotation-language graphemes. We find that: first, the multitask learning framework gives significant improvement over monolingual, semisupervised learning, multilingual DNN training, and transfer learning baselines; second, a Gaussian Mixture Model-Hidden-Markov Model (GMM-HMM) model adapted using PT improves alignments, thereby improving training; and third, bottleneck features trained on the mismatched transcriptions lead to even better alignments, resulting in further performance gains of the multitask DNN.

The first seasonal model is based on large scale climate signals data around the world.

Comparison of modelling results shows that the Gamma test method improves the Nash\u2013Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of modelling performance as 8% and 10% for dry and wet seasons, respectively. In this study, Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for predicting rainfall in the region has been used and its results are compared with the benchmark models such as K-nearest neighbours (KNN) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The results show better performance of the SVM model at testing stage. In the second model, statistical downscaling model (SDSM) as a popular downscaling tool has been used. In this model, using the outputs from GCM, the rainfall of Zayandehrood dam is projected under two climate change scenarios. Most effective variables have been identified among 26 predictor variables. Comparison of the results of the two models shows that the developed SVM model has lesser errors in monthly rainfall estimation.

In this paper, we proposed a featured temporal segmentation method and an AdaBoost-BP detector to automatically evaluate the internal leakage faults in hydraulic actuators. The internal leakage detection model based on the proposed featured temporal segmentation (FTS) combined with AdaBoost-BP method consists of three main steps. First, the pressure signals are divided into several segments using wavelet analysis, with the assumption that the temporal segments may contain different sensitive features related to the internal leakage. Second, for every segment, several statistics from the time domain are extracted to describe the working conditions of the hydraulic cylinders. All these variables from different temporal segments are combined to form the feature vectors. Third, an AdaBoost-BP neural network classifier is applied as the evaluator to differentiate the levels of the internal leakage of the hydraulic cylinders. The proposed method was validated on a test bench of hydraulic cylinders with different levels of the internal leakage. The comparison with the traditional features extracted from the wavelet coefficients and the FTS method are conducted. In addition, the accuracy of the classifier in terms of the AdaBoost-BP method is compared with that of the classifier based on Random Forest. The results show that the FTS and AdaBoost-BP method can not only effectively identify the leakage levels but also improve the accuracy of evaluating the internal leakage. Thus, the proposed method of internal leakage evaluation may enable the condition based monitoring of the hydraulic system by using the built-in pressure sensors, which is feasible in most practical industrial applications.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.measurement.2018.08.029", "venue": null, "journal": "Measurement", "mag_id": "2887315962", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["204970696"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:117612452"}

The aspect of humanly understandable and intuitive models is of crucial importance in any domain where the model needs to be validated before it can be implemented, such as in the medical diagnosis and credit scoring domain. A classification model that is accurate, comprehensible and intuitive is defined in this thesis as acceptable for implementation. Building such acceptable models is the goal of this text.

Three modelling schemes were examined, based on: (1) high-density LiDAR data (160 returns m\u22122), (2) Worldview-2 multispectral imagery, and (3) Worldview-2 and LiDAR in combination. Variables related to the crown structure and height of individual trees were extracted from the normalized LiDAR point cloud at individual-tree level, after performing individual tree crown (ITC) delineation. Vegetation indices and the Haralick texture indices were derived from Worldview-2 images and served as independent spectral variables. Selection of the best predictor subset was done after a comparison of three variable selection procedures: (1) Random Forests with cross validation (AUCRFcv), (2) Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and (3) Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). To classify the species, 9 regression techniques were combined using ensemble models. Predictions were evaluated using cross validation and an independent dataset. Integration of datasets and models improved individual tree species classification (True Skills Statistic, TSS; from 0.67 to 0.81) over individual techniques and maintained strong predictive power (Relative Operating Characteristic, ROC = 0.91). Assemblage of regression models and integration of the datasets provided more reliable species distribution maps and associated tree-scale mapping uncertainties. Our study highlights the potential of model and data assemblage at improving species classifications needed in present-day forest planning and management.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jag.2017.09.016", "venue": "Int.

Therefore, this paper addresses the problem of SAR image classification by employing the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to produce more labeled SAR data. We propose special GANs for generating SAR images to be used in the training process. First, we incorporate the quadratic operation into the GAN, extending the convolution to make the discriminator better represent the SAR data; second, the statistical characteristics of SAR images are integrated into the GAN to make its value function more reasonable; finally, two types of parallel connected GANs are designed, one of which we call PWGAN, combining the Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) and Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) together in the structure, and the other, which we call CNN-PGAN, applying a pre-trained CNN as a discriminator to the parallel GAN.

In this paper, an approach for building detection in urban areas based on object features extracted from high-resolution interferometric SAR (InSAR) data and one orthophoto is presented. Features describing local evidence as well as context information are used. Buildings are detected by classification of those feature vectors within a Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework.

First, to predict customer response to bank direct marketing by applying four classifiers namely, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN), Decision Tree (C4.5), Logistic Regression and Random Forest (RF). Results from the study portray that Random Forest Classifier with an accuracy of 87% is the most prolific classifier in terms of predictive ability.

A cluster analysis was performed to achieve this goal.

In a first stage we have applied Machine Learning techniques to the analysis of the spontaneous, waking EEG of REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD) patients. We know that patients with RBD may evolve towards PD and other synucleinopathies (i.e. DLB) providing a useful guide in the search for biomarkers. EEG has proven to be sensitive to brain alterations related to both RBD and PD patients, and it is known that patients with either RBD or de novo PD without obvious cognitive alterations show similar EEG/MEG alterations (mainly slowing of the EEG) while awake. In the work described herein we achieve the classification of patients according to their ultimate diagnosis, differentiating among different patient groups. We have analyzed EEG data from a study of RBD patients at the Center for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine of Montreal. The EEG was recorded from 8 patients who years later evolved to PD, 8 patients who later evolved to LBD, 10 patients with RBD who did not convert, and 17 healthy controls. It is worth mentioning that 80% of the PD and DLB patients developed disease at a follow-\u00ad\u2010up of 8 years. Support Vector Machines were applied to different feature types. Absolute Band Power features extracted each 4 seconds outperform the other ones. After non-\u00ad\u2010parametric feature selection of the 5 most discriminative channel-\u00ad\u2010band combinations, classification was applied. A procedure for performance estimation close to operational conditions, which is denoted as leave-\u00ad\u2010pair-\u00ad\u2010subjects-\u00ad\u2010 out, has been employed for evaluation of the implemented system. Excellent performance levels, AUC 93.75-\u00ad\u201099%, were obtained for all realized group comparisons. In conclusion, we believe that these results support the idea that classification of EEG shows great potential as a preclinical biomarker. Our results confirm the existent literature, where EEG slowing characterizes RBD and PD/DLB patients. Furthermore we have attained this characterization at the individual subject level for the first time by employing machine learning.

In the first part we apply techniques from the field of text mining to classify sentences in encounter notes of the electronic health record (EHR) into classes of {it subjective}, {it objective} and {it plan} character. This is a simplification of the {it SOAP} standard, and is applied due to the way GPs structure the encounter notes. Structuring the information in a subjective, objective, and plan way, may enhance future information flow between the EHR and the personal health record (PHR). In the second part of the project we seek to use apply the most adequate to classify encounter notes from patient histories of patients suffering from diabetes. We believe that the distribution of sentences of a subjective, objective, and plan character changes according to different phases of diseases. In our work we experiment with several preprocessing techniques, classifiers, and amounts of data. Of the classifiers considered, we find that Complement Naive Bayes (CNB) produces the best result, both when the preprocessing of the data has taken place and not. On the raw dataset, CNB yields an accuracy of 81.03%, while on the preprocessed dataset, CNB yields an accuracy of 81.95%. The Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier algorithm yields results comparable to the results obtained by use of CNB, while the J48 classifier algorithm performs poorer. Concerning preprocessing techniques, we find that use of techniques reducing the dimensionality of the datasets improves the results for smaller attribute sets, but worsens the result for larger attribute sets. The trend is opposite for preprocessing techniques that expand the set of attributes. However, finding the ratio between the size of the dataset and the number of attributes, where the preprocessing techniques improve the result, is difficult. Hence, preprocessing techniques are not applied in the second part of the project. From the result of the classification of the patient histories we have extracted graphs that show how the sentence class distribution after the first diagnosis of diabetes is set. Although no empiric research is carried out, we believe that such graphs may, through further research, facilitate the recognition of points of interest in the patient history. From the same results we also create graphs that show the average distribution of sentences of subjective, objective, and plan character for 429 patients after the first diagnosis of diabetes is set. From these graphs we find evidence that there is an overrepresentation of subjective sentences in encounter notes where the diagnosis of diabetes is first set.

Given their discrete distributions in the North Pacific and North Atlantic, it is widely believed that North Pacific and North Atlantic fin whales should not be contained within the same subspecies. We analyzed ~14K base pairs of the complete mitogenome for 154 fin whales from the North Pacific, North Atlantic (including Mediterranean Sea), and Southern Hemisphere to assess phylogenetic patterns. A Bayesian tree of the resulting 125 haplotypes revealed several well-supported clades representing each ocean basin, with no haplotypes shared among ocean basins. The North Atlantic haplotypes (n = 12) form a sister clade to those from the Southern Hemisphere (n = 41). After calibrating the tree with results from previously published studies, the time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for this clade and 63 of the 72 haplotypes from the North Pacific was approximately 1 MYA. The remaining 9 North Pacific haplotypes formed a well-supported clade within the Southern Hemisphere. The TMRCA for this node suggests that at least one female from the Southern Hemisphere immigrated to the North Pacific approximately 100 KYA. We also demonstrate using Random Forest (RF), a classification tree-based method, to quantify the diagnosability of mtDNA sequence data. This technique correctly classified 99% of the haplotypes to their original ocean basin. To our knowledge, this is the first use of RF on sequence data in a manner comparable to standard morphometric assessments of diagnosability in taxonomic studies.

For complex diseases, such as cancer, characterized by high inter-patient variance, the implementation of precision medicine approaches is dependent upon understanding the disease process at the molecular level. While the \u2018omics\u2019 era provides unique opportunities to dissect the molecular features of diseases, the ability to apply it to targeted therapeutic efforts is hindered by both the massive size and diverse nature of the \u2018omic\u2019 data. Recent advances with Deep Learning Neural Networks (DLNN), suggests that DLNN could be trained on large data sets to efficiently predict therapeutic responses. We present the application of Association Rule Mining (Market Basket Analysis) in combination with Deep Learning to integrate and extract knowledge in the form of easily interpretable rules from the molecular profiles of 689 cancer cell lines and predict pharmacological responses to 139 anti-cancer drugs. The proposed algorithm achieved superior classification and outperformed Random Forests which currently represents the state-of-the-art classification process. Finally, the in silico pipeline presented introduces a novel strategy for identifying drug combinations with high therapeutic potential. For the first time, we demonstrate that DLNN trained on a large pharmacogenomic data set can effectively predict the therapeutic response of specific drugs in specific cancer types, from a large panel of both drugs and cancer cell lines.

Therefore, mapping the PMF plays a crucial role in agricultural production, environmental protection and resource management. However, appropriate data selection criteria are currently lacking. Thus, this study was carried out in two main plastic-mulching practice regions, Jizhou and Guyuan, to look for an appropriate spatial scale for mapping PMF with remote sensing. The average local variance (ALV) function was used to obtain the appropriate spatial scale for mapping PMF based on the GaoFen-1 (GF-1) satellite imagery. Afterwards, in order to validate the effectiveness of the selected method and to interpret the relationship between the appropriate spatial scale derived from the ALV and the spatial scale with the highest classification accuracy, we classified the imagery with varying spatial resolution by the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm using the spectral features, textural features and the combined spectral and textural features respectively. The results indicated that the appropriate spatial scales from the ALV lie between 8 m and 20 m for mapping the PMF both in Jizhou and Guyuan. However, there is a proportional relation: the spatial scale with the highest classification accuracy is at the 1/2 location of the appropriate spatial scale generated from the ALV in Jizhou and at the 2/3 location of the appropriate spatial scale generated from the ALV in Guyuan.

This paper presents a logistic discriminant metric learning method for this challenging problem. Different with most existing metric learning algorithms, it exploits both original data and auxiliary data during training, which is motivated by the new machine learning paradigm - Learning Using Privileged Information. Such privileged information is a kind of auxiliary knowledge which is only available during training. Our goal is to learn an optimal distance function by constructing a locally adaptive decision rule with the help of privileged information. We jointly learn two distance metrics by minimizing the empirical loss penalizing the difference between the distance in the original space and that in the privileged space. In our setting, the distance in the privileged space functions as a local decision threshold, which guides the decision making in the original space like a teacher. The metric learned from the original space is used to compute the distance between a probe image and a gallery image during testing. In addition, we extend the proposed approach to a multi-view setting which is able to explore the complementation of multiple feature representations. In the multi-view setting, multiple metrics corresponding to different original features are jointly learned, guided by the same privileged information. Besides, an effective iterative optimization scheme is introduced to simultaneously optimize the metrics and the assigned metric weights.

In this work, an FE model of an isogrid plate is developed, and variability is introduced for each state observation. Different states are modeled as masses distributed at several discrete locations. Signals are obtained through an explicit time-domain analysis. Matching Pursuit Decomposition is used to extract physically significant parameters from the signals, the features are reduced to a more manageable subset, and Support Vector Machines are utilized to identify important features in the sensor signals.

The third algorithm (published in IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied ::: Earth Observations and Remote Sensing) avoids the Gaussian distribution based change ::: metrics, one of the limitations of the existing methods, and improves the change detection ::: accuracy and detection delays significantly by using assumption free, directly estimated ::: relative density-ratio based Repeated Sequential Probability Ratio Test (RSPRT) as test ::: statistic on the parameter time series. The fourth algorithm (submitted to ISPRS Journal of ::: Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing) is a supervised technique that utilizes bi-temporal ::: multi-spectral Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery and models class posterior probabilities of the ::: change and no change classes non-parametrically, using a linear combination of a large ::: number of Gaussian Kernels through Least Squares Probabilistic Classifier (LSPC) formulation. ::: This helps in avoiding the Gaussian assumption about the data, which is a ::: major drawback of the traditional Bayesian Classifiers e.g. Maximum Likelhood Classifier ::: (MLC) and Naive Bayes (NB). Another popular classifier which avoids this limitation ::: is Support Vector Machine (SVM) but its drawback is that it assigns only class labels to ::: the test samples and does not provide probabilistic class-memberships. Moreover, it is a ::: binary classifier in its original formulation and needs different strategies to be adopted in ::: order to use it for multi-class problems and also to make it probabilistic. The LSPC based ::: framework, on the other hand, is non-parametric as well as capable of assigning degree ::: of class-membership (probabilistic) to test samples and handling multi-class problems in ::: its original formulation. Its application to leaf beetle infestation problem in north-eastern ::: Tasmanian Eucalyptus plantations suggested improvement in detection accuracy. These methods have been compared with their respective counterparts in the literature in order ::: to demonstrate their effectiveness. ::: The contribution of this thesis is four folds: (i) advancing our understanding of land/forest ::: cover change detection using quantitative/statistical approaches, (ii) proposition of reliable ::: statistical approaches for near-real time land/forest cover change detection in hypertemporal ::: coarse spatial resolution MODIS data, with especial emphasis on changes due ::: to beetle infestations in pine forests, (iii) efficient threshold selection in complex scenario ::: of near-real time change detection, when an optimal trade off between more than 2 performance ::: indices is needed, and (iv) proposition of a non-parametric approach for detecting ::: land/forest cover changes (bark beetle problem in north-eastern Tasmanian Eucalyptus ::: plantations) in bi-temporal Landsat 7 EMT+ data.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2574262669", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:132607200"}

In this work, a new approach has been developed which is based on the pixel-based and object-based probability information as well as the spatial parameters including the distance, neighborhood, region size and the type of change. Two Landsat TM images of Isfahan urban area (Iran), acquired in 1990 and 1998 have been co-registered using the first order polynomial and the nearest neighbor resampling approaches .The registered images have been classified using the Maximum Likelihood Classification Algorithm (MLC) and the probabilistic measures have been generated. Using different spatial analysis functions, for modeling the change of agriculture to urban areas the relevant spatial parameters have been extracted. The probabilistic and spatial parameters have been integrated through the logistic regression modeling approach to model uncertainty of change of agriculture to urban areas.

The Multi-Armed-Bandit (MAB) problem is the iconic representation of the exploration versus exploitation dilemma. In brief, a gambler repeatedly selects and play, one out of N possible slot machines or arms and either receives a reward or a penalty. The objective of the gambler is then to locate the most rewarding arm to play, while in the process maximize his winnings. In this paper we investigate a challenging variant of the MAB problem, namely the non-stationary N-Door puzzle. Here, instead of directly observing the reward, the gambler is only told whether the optimal arm lies to the \"left\" or to the \"right\" of the selected arm, with the feedback being erroneous with probability 1 -- p. However, due to the non-stationary property the optimal arm can abruptly and without notice switch place with a previous sub-optimal arm. To further complicate the situation, we do not assume that the environment is informative, that is, we allow for a traitorous environment that on-average guide the gambler in the opposite direction of the optimal arm (adversarial learning problem). This coupled with the non-stationary property makes for a highly demanding reinforcement learning problem. The novel scheme presented in this paper enhance the previous top contender for the stationary N-door problem with the capability to detect and adapt to a changing environment.

Since it is very difficult to cure the disease at severe stage, it can be detected initially by using proposed method. This method proposes segmentation of optic disc and optic cup using superpixel classification and extraction of the feature values for glaucoma screening. Superpixels are local, coherent and provide a convenient primitive to compute local image features. In optic disc segmentation, superpixels using SLIC (simple linear iterative clustering) is generated which is followed by feature extraction where Contrast Enhanced histogram and center surround statistics (in which Gaussian pyramid based feature is used) are implemented, then each superpixel is classified as disc or non-disc to deform the exact disc region. Using the same process, the optic cup is also segmented. The optic disc and optic cup boundaries in retinal fundus image are identified using Randomized Hough\u201fs transform. The 1280 feature values are obtained from Contrast Enhanced histogram and 36 feature values are obtained from center surround statistics. Therefore a total of 1316 feature values of the reference fundus image are stored in the database.

Long-term drought forecasting is of great importance for the development of risk management strategies. Recently, large-scale climate drivers (e.g. El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation) have been demonstrated as useful in the application of drought forecasting. Machine learning-based models that use climate drivers as input are commonly adopted to provide drought forecasts as these models are easy to develop and require less information compared to physical-based models. However, few machine learning-based models have been developed to forecast drought conditions during growing season across all Australian cropping areas. In this study, we developed a growing season (Apr.-Nov.) meteorological drought forecasting model for each climate gauging location across the Australian wheatbelt based on multiple lagged (past) large-scale climate indices and the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was used as the response variable to measure the degree of meteorological drought. Results showed that the RF model could provide satisfactory drought forecasts in the eastern areas of the wheatbelt with Pearson's correlation coefficient r > 0.5 and normalized Root Mean Square Error (nRMSE) < 23%. Forecasted drought maps matched well with observed drought maps for three representative periods. We identified NINO3.4 sea surface temperature and Multivariate ENSO Index as the most influential indices dominating growing season drought conditions across the wheatbelt. In addition, lagged impacts of large-scale climate drivers on growing season drought conditions were long-lasting and the indices in previous year could also potentially affect drought conditions during current year. As large-scale climate indices are readily available and can be rapidly used to feed data driven models, we believe the proposed meteorological drought forecasting models can be easily extended to other regions to provide drought outlooks which can help mitigate adverse drought impacts.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "32247977", "doi": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138162", "venue": "The Science of the total environment", "journal": "The Science of the total environment", "mag_id": "3013562509", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214810823"}

We compared three statistical techniques (Reduced Major Axis regression, Gradient Nearest Neighbor imputation, and Random Forests regression trees) for modeling biomass to better understand how the choice of model type affected predictions of biomass dynamics. Models from each technique were applied across the 20+ year Landsat time-series to derive biomass trajectories, to which a curve-fitting algorithm was applied to leverage the temporal information contained within the time-series itself and to minimize error associated with exogenous effects such as biomass measurements, phenology, sun angle, and other sources. The effect of curve-fitting was an improvement in predictions of biomass change when validated against observed biomass change from repeat FIA inventories. Maps of biomass dynamics were integrated with maps depicting the location and timing of forest disturbance and regrowth to assess the biomass consequences of these processes over large areas and long time frames.

Manual spelling, or finger spelling, is a system where each letter of the alphabet is represented by an unique and discrete movement of the hand. RGB and depth images can be used to characterize hand shapes corresponding to letters of the alphabet. The advantage of depth cameras over color cameras for gesture recognition is more evident when performing hand segmentation. In this paper, we propose a hybrid system approach for finger spelling recognition using RGB-D information from Kinect sensor. In a first stage, the hand area is segmented from background using depth map and precise hand shape is extracted using both depth data and color data from Kinect sensor. Motivated by the performance of kernel based features, due to its simplicity and the ability to turn any type of pixel attribute into patch-level features, we decided to use the gradient kernel descriptor for feature extraction from depth images. The Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) is used for describing the content of the RGB image. Then, the Bag-of-Visual-Words approach is used to extract semantic information. Finally, these features are used as input of our Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The performance of this approach is quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated on a dataset of real images of American Sign Language (ASL) hand shapes. Three experiments were performed, using a combination of RGB and depth information and also using only RGB or depth information separately. The database used is composed of 120,000 images.

Among different methods of flood forecasting, data-driven models have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their strong ability to simulate nonlinear hydrological processes. This study proposed a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model, which is a powerful artificial intelligence-based model originated from statistical learning theory, to forecast flash floods at different lead times in a small mountainous catchment. The lagged average rainfall and runoff are identified as model input variables, and the time lags associated with the model input variables are determined by the hydrological concept of the time of response. There are 69 flash flood events collected from 1984 to 2012 in a mountainous catchment in China and then used for the model training and testing. The contribution of the runoff variables to the predictions and the phase lag of model outputs are analyzed. The results show that: (i) the SVR model has satisfactory predictive performances for one to three-hours ahead forecasting; (ii) the lagged runoff variables have a more significant effect on the predictions than the rainfall variables; and (iii) the phase lag (time difference) of prediction results significantly exists in both two- and three-hours-ahead forecasting models, however, the input rainfall information can assist in mitigating the phase lag of peak flow.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/w11071327", "venue": null, "journal": "Water", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2953977289", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["16715985", "133935560", "134636833", "85254830", "128397841", "129404025", "59976836", "134359621", "61360331", "116680453", "195704085", "130542130", "203099620", "11715509", "130359659", "64647733", "60510826", "11431234", "6662524", "2115720", "125369608", "125401412", "128549933", "14830500", "134094608", "140601576", "54727478", "1496950", "130233729", "3036436", "126947293", "107637690", "111395044", "157367275", "132866337", "135336771", "743542", "129344743", "195707283", "130003173", "961425", "56105258", "129922626", "43039643", "129085591", "128624138", "55215654", "18422697", "128620131", "33827786", "129157539", "60893186", "130283737", "122646348", "134575760", "15235434", "128402690", "95790694", "55447260", "128735310", "140663354", "7626668", "44750454", "129180882"], "inbound_citations": ["208224923", "204804030", "209944664"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:198161990"}

In connectomics, neuroscientists seek to obtain the circuit diagram involving all neurons and synapses in such a volume image. Mapping neuron connectivity requires tracing each and every neural process through terabytes of image data. Due to the size and complexity of these volume images, fully automated analysis methods are desperately needed. In this thesis, I consider automated, machine learning-based neurite segmentation approaches based on a simultaneous merge decision of adjacent supervoxels. ::: ::: - Given a learned likelihood of merging adjacent supervoxels, Chapter 4 adapts a probabilistic graphical model which ensures that merge decisions are consistent ::: and the surfaces of final segments are closed. This model can be posed as a multicut optimization problem and is solved with the cutting-plane method. In order to scale to large datasets, a fast search for (and good choice of) violated cycle constraints is crucial. Quantitative experiments show that the proposed closed-surface regularization significantly improves segmentation performance. ::: ::: - In Chapter 5, I investigate whether the edge weights of the previous model can be chosen to minimize the loss with respect to non-local segmentation quality measures (e.g. Rand Index). Suitable w are obtained from a structured learning approach. In the Structured Support Vector Machine formulation, a novel fast enumeration scheme is used to find the most violated constraint. Quantitative experiments show that structured learning can improve upon unstructured methods. Furthermore, I introduce a new approximate, hierarchical and blockwise optimization approach for large-scale multicut segmentation. Using this method, high-quality approximate solutions for large problem instances are found quickly. ::: ::: - Chapter 6 introduces another novel approximate scheme for multicut segmentation -- Cut, Glue&Cut -- which is based on the move-making paradigm. First, the graph is recursively partitioned into small regions (cut phase). Then, for any two adjacent regions, alternative cuts of these two regions define possible moves (glue&cut phase). The proposed algorithm finds segmentations that are { as measured by a loss function { as close to the ground-truth as the global optimum found by exact solvers, while being significantly faster than existing methods. ::: ::: - In order to jointly label resulting segments as well as to label the boundaries between segments, Chapter 7 proposes the Asymmetric Multi-way Cut model, a variant of Multi-way Cut. In this new model, within-class cuts are allowed for some labels, while being forbidden for other labels. Qualitative experiments show when such a formulation can be beneficial. In particular, an application to joint neurite and cell organelle labeling in EM volume images is discussed. ::: ::: - Custom software tools that can cope with the large data volumes common in the field of connectomics are a prerequisite for the implementation and evaluation of novel segmentation techniques.

Traditional machine learning algorithms usually focus on modeling hand-crafted feature representations manually extracted from the raw data and performance of the model highly depends on the quality of the data representation. However, feature engineering is laborious, hardly accurate, and less generalizable. Thus the weakness of many current learning algorithms is not how well they can model the data, but how good their input data representation are.In this thesis, we adopt learning algorithms both on representing and modeling the graph data in two different applications. In the first work, We first developed representation on nodes, and later apply a well-known VG kernel on this representation. In the second work, we show the power of representation captured by applying jointly optimization on the nodes representations and the model.

These local MRF models often result in smoothed segmentation boundaries, since they penalize the assignment of different labels to neighboring pixels and are limited in the use of long-range interactions. Although recent work on fully connected random fields and deep random fields has shown to be very promising in addressing these issues, both streams of approaches face certain limitations, which could affect inference performance and computational tractability. In this paper, we introduce the concept of deep randomly connected conditional random fields DRCRF, which fuse fully-connected random fields and deep random fields together to obtain benefits from long-range interactions while allowing for efficient inference using arbitrary potential functions. Leveraging random graph theory, the concept of stochastic cliques is incorporated into a deep CRF structure to take better advantage of long-range interactions while maintaining computational tractability. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DRCRF framework outperforms existing fully connected CRF frameworks and provides results comparable to the principled deep random field framework, which is among the state of the art in random field frameworks for image segmentation.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2603976", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2511989316", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["61936075", "13120590", "242941", "3084505", "2117454", "9779450", "35912107", "11859305", "206590944", "348684", "7556238", "632396", "749550", "5574079", "12917143", "2633892", "8938876", "1053072", "206764694", "6958332", "2068733", "2695207", "12358641", "14831952", "60166982", "115691220", "118960561", "7292019", "120489597", "45117773", "1677606", "6202829", "2772063", "207252270"], "inbound_citations": ["49559693", "11249308", "21556189"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5085303"}

It is difficult to use these data on digital city because there are too many buildings and objects not needed and it is also a waste of time to create this model. As the TLS can easily achieve detailed and accurate recording of surfaces, in addition to which, the digital camera mounted on the TLS could also acquire rich textures besides the measurements of edges and corners, it is easy to extract the outlines of objects by combining point clouds with the according images which are segmented by SVM(Support Vector Machine). However TIN models created on those parts are difficult to get outlines. The fine models can be accurately and quickly created using outlines whereas the structure is simple or using TIN modeling whereas the structure is difficult.

When multiple views (sources) of data (e.g., acoustic and articulatory) are available for training while only one view (e.g., acoustic) is available for testing, a better representation can be learned by simultaneously analyzing multiple sources of data.

However, a number of real-world applications require a model but have little or no data available of the specific environment. Predominantly, standard machine learning approaches focus on a need for training data for such models to come from the same domain as the target task. Such restrictions can severely reduce the data acquisition making it extremely costly, or in certain situations, impossible. This impedes the ability of these approaches to model such environments. It is on this particular problem that this paper is focussed. In this paper two concepts, Transfer Learning (TL) and Fuzzy Logic (FL) are combined in a framework, Fuzzy Transfer Learning (FuzzyTL), to address the problem of learning tasks that have no prior direct contextual knowledge. Through the use of a FL based learning method, uncertainty that is evident in dynamic environments is represented. By applying a TL approach through the combining of labelled data from a contextually related source task, and little or no unlabelled data from a target task, the framework is shown to be able to accomplish predictive tasks using models learned from contextually different data.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ins.2014.09.004", "venue": "Inf.

Images usually contain rich semantic information, and people usually understand images at a high semantic level. Therefore, achieving the ability to use advanced technology to identify the emotional semantics contained in images to enable emotional semantic image classification remains an urgent issue in various industries. To this end, this study proposes an improved OCC emotion model that integrates personality and mood factors for emotional modelling to describe the emotional semantic information contained in an image. The proposed classification system integrates the k-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithm with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The MapReduce parallel programming model was used to adapt the KNN-SVM algorithm for parallel implementation in the Hadoop cluster environment, thereby achieving emotional semantic understanding for the classification of a massive collection of images. For training and testing, 70,000 scene images were randomly selected from the SUN Database. The experimental results indicate that users with different personalities show overall consistency in their emotional understanding of the same image. For a training sample size of 50,000, the classification accuracies for different emotional categories targeted at users with different personalities were approximately 95%, and the training time was only 1/5 of that required for the corresponding algorithm with a single-node architecture. Furthermore, the speedup of the system also showed a linearly increasing tendency. Thus, the experiments achieved a good classification effect and can lay a foundation for classification in terms of additional types of emotional image semantics, thereby demonstrating the practical significance of the proposed model.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5761962", "pubmed_id": "29320579", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0191064", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2783687379", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["35697937", "148102202", "20168126", "154511025", "486572", "14346181", "6623420", "63479403", "43611715", "11253562", "215197660", "16621075", "9756605", "5799014", "30924452", "14269553", "45104142", "17887893", "15091825", "142843350", "145137143", "18780840", "10675897", "16150093", "5246200", "3243015", "12912512", "215600275", "40039314"], "inbound_citations": ["204244865", "108293403", "209696701"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3538856"}

However, directly calculating the distances between the query image and support image in existing methods may cause ambiguity because dominant objects can locate anywhere on images. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Semantic Alignment Metric Learning (SAML) method for few-shot learning that aligns the semantically relevant dominant objects through a ``collect-and-select'' strategy. Specifically, we first calculate a relation matrix (RM) to ``collect\" the distances of each local region pairs of the $3$D tensor extracted from a query image and the mean tensor of the support images. Then, the attention technique is adapted to ``select\" the semantically relevant pairs and put more weights on them. Afterwards, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is utilized to map the reweighted RMs to their corresponding similarity scores. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the generalization ability of SAML and gives a theoretical guarantee. Empirical results demonstrate that semantic alignment is achieved.

The images captured from the aerial inspection can be utilized to detect the fault of insulators for further maintenance. For automatic transmission lines inspection system, the insulator fault detection is an interesting and challenging task due to the complex background and diversified insulators. In this paper, we propose a novel insulator fault detection method based on multi-level perception for aerial images. The multi-level perception is implemented by an ensemble architecture which combines three single-level perceptions. These single-level perceptions include the low level, middle level, and high level that are named by the attention to the insulator fault. They detect the insulator fault in the entire image, multi-insulator image, and single-insulator image, respectively. To address the filtering problem in the combination of three single-level perceptions, an ensemble method is proposed for generating the final results. For training the detection models employed in the multi-level perception, a powerful deep meta-architecture so-called single shot multibox detector (SSD) is utilized. The well-trained SSD models can automatically extract high quality features from aerial images instead of manually extracting features. By using the multi-level perception, the advantages of global and local information can achieve a favorable balance. Moreover, limited inspection images are fully utilized by the proposed method. Fault detection recall and precision of the proposed method are 93.69% and 91.23% testing in the practical inspection data, and insulator fault under various conditions can be correctly detected in the aerial images.

However, the lack of labeled faces of the same person across a long age range makes it challenging. Because of different aging speed of different persons, our face aging approach aims at synthesizing a face whose target age lies in some given age group instead of synthesizing a face with a certain age. By grouping faces with target age together, the objective of face aging is equivalent to transferring aging patterns of faces within the target age group to the face whose aged face is to be synthesized. Meanwhile, the synthesized face should have the same identity with the input face. Thus we propose an Identity-Preserved Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (IPCGANs) framework, in which a Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks module functions as generating a face that looks realistic and is with the target age, an identity-preserved module preserves the identity information and an age classifier forces the generated face with the target age.

Human beings, on the other hand, seem to cope very well with uncertain and unpredictable environments, often relying on perception-based information. Furthermore, humans beings can also utilize perceptions to guide their learning on those parts of the perception-action space that are actually relevant to the task. Therefore, we conduct a research aimed at improving robot learning through the incorporation of both perceptionbased and measurement-based information. For this reason, a fuzzy reinforcement learning (FRL) agent is proposed in this paper. Based on a neural-fuzzy architecture, different kinds of information can be incorporated into the FRL agent to initialise its action network, critic network and evaluation feedback module so as to accelerate its learning. By making use of the global optimisation capability of GAs (genetic algorithms), a GA-based FRL (GAFRL) agent is presented to solve the local minima problem in traditional actor-critic reinforcement learning. On the other hand, with the prediction capability of the critic network, GAs can perform a more effective global search. Different GAFRL agents are constructed and verified by using the simulation model of a physical biped robot. The simulation analysis shows that the biped learning rate for dynamic balance can be improved by incorporating perception-based information on biped balancing and walking evaluation.The biped robot can find its application in ocean exploration, detection or sea rescue activity, as well as military maritime activity.", "year": 2002, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1497590185", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:107058260"}

Power loss analysis is efficient for the monitoring of large power plants and for developing an optimal cleaning schedule, but it is not adapted for remote monitoring of standalone photovoltaic systems that are used in rural and poor regions. Indeed, this technique relies on a costly and dirt sensitive irradiance sensor. This paper investigates the possibility of a low-cost monitoring of cleaning interventions on photovoltaic modules during daytime. We believe that it can be helpful to know whether the soiling is regularly removed or not, and to decide if it is necessary to carry out additional cleaning operations. The problem is formulated as a classification task to automatically identify the occurrence of a cleaning intervention using a time window of temperature, voltage and current measurements of a photovoltaic array. We investigate machine learning tools based on Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Networks and Random Forest to achieve such classification task. In addition, we study the influence of the temporal resolution of the signals and the feature extraction on the classification performance. The experiments are conducted on a real dataset and show promising results with classification accuracy of up to 95%.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that SHNE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various heterogeneous network mining tasks, such as link prediction, document retrieval, node recommendation, relevance search, and class visualization.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3289600.3291001", "venue": null, "journal": "Proceedings of the Twelfth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2907253296", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16689401", "50773183", "322265", "5590763", "3951790", "3919301", "207238980", "4755450", "22051497", "2155233", "6628106", "28890170", "14108528", "50767861", "65443784", "16447573", "4892060", "3051291", "3952914", "11009476", "3914832", "3743029", "44141976", "14679478", "6693112", "10082102", "11881626", "6877426", "35493", "8399404", "3348552", "6157828", "50776812", "4327044", "207238964", "20401422", "8251872", "2452205", "7008752", "50776071", "207209998", "4892921", "51607478"], "inbound_citations": ["208158447", "211075818", "198952485", "208175960", "214743464", "210884003"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59528420"}

In addition, the SLSA architecture was also tested against established methods such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the Naive Bayes Classifier (NB) on the Reuters-21578 and MNIST datasets. The experiments show the promise of SLSA as a pre-training step, in which stacked of SLSA yielded the lowest classification error and the highest F-measure scores on the MNIST and Reuters-21578 datasets respectively. Hence, this paper establishes the value of pre-training deep neural network, by using the SLSA.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280502", "venue": "2015 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)", "journal": "2015 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1650233673", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["52860197", "1658773", "2309950", "14201947", "814743", "877639", "24512455", "144828484", "17804904", "27918834", "1969477", "43271595", "393948", "207168299", "206775335", "123532178", "10077891", "14832074", "2748729"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14606610"}

The Minimal Complexity Machine (MCM), that has been proposed very recently, shows that it is possible to learn a classifier with minimal VC dimension, leading to sparse representations and good generalization. In this paper, we draw on results from the MCM to propose a hybrid variant of the ELM, termed the Minimal Complexity - Extreme Learning Machine (MC-ELM), in order to realize a robust classifier that minimizes an exact bound on the VC dimension. The MC-ELM solves a linear programming problem for the last layer and offers the advantages of large margin and low VC dimension.

Many transfer learning-based algorithms, for example, dual transfer learning, triplex transfer learning, etc., have been proposed for cross-domain classification, by detecting a shared low-dimensional feature representation for both source and target domains. These methods, however, often assume that the word clusters matrix or the clusters association matrix as knowledge transferring bridges are exactly the same across different domains, which is actually unrealistic in real-world applications and, therefore, could degrade classification performance. In light of this, in this paper, we propose a softly associative transfer learning algorithm for cross-domain text classification. Specifically, we integrate two non-negative matrix tri-factorizations into a joint optimization framework, with approximate constraints on both word clusters matrices and clusters association matrices so as to allow proper diversity in knowledge transfer, and with another approximate constraint on class labels in source domains in order to handle noisy labels. An iterative algorithm is then proposed to solve the above problem, with its convergence verified theoretically and empirically.

We define a positive definite kernel for point pairs on SPD manifold and transform metric learning on SPD manifold to a point pair classification problem. The metric learning problem can be efficiently solved by standard support vector machines. Compared with classifying points on SPD manifold by support vector machines directly, SVML effectively learns a distance metric for SPD matrices by training a binary support vector machine model.

To overcome these problems, we propose a semisupervised learning (SSL) road detection method based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) and a weakly supervised learning (WSL) method based on conditional GANs. Specifically, in our SSL method, the generator generates the road detection results of labeled and unlabeled images, and then they are fed into the discriminator, which assigns a label on each input to judge whether it is labeled. Additionally, in WSL method we add another network to predict road shapes of input images and use them in both generator and discriminator to constrain the learning progress. By training under these frameworks, the discriminators can guide a latent annotation process on the unlabeled data; therefore, the networks can learn better representations of road areas and leverage the feature distributions on both labeled and unlabeled data.

Underlying this framework is the idea of integrating in situ with EO and a habitat classification scheme based on General Habitat Categories (GHC), designed with an Earth Observation-perspective. Here we report on EBONE work that explored the use of NDVI-derived phenology metrics for the identification and mapping of Forest GHCs. Thirty-one phenology metrics were extracted from MODIS NDVI time series for Europe. Classifications to discriminate forest types were performed based on a Random Forests\u2122 classifier in selected regions. Results indicate that date phenology metrics are generally more significant for forest type discrimination. The achieved class accuracies are generally not satisfactory, except for coniferous forests in homogeneous stands (77-82%). The main causes of low classification accuracies were identified as (i) the spatial resolution of the imagery (250 m) which led to mixed phenology signals; (ii) the GHC scheme classification design, which allows for parcels of heterogeneous covers, and (iii) the low number of the training samples available from field surveys.

Analyzing this data, in order to identify interesting biological features, is an enormous challenge, especially if it would be done manually. Think about trying to find a specific word in a book, say Don Quixote, and we have to search word by word. How long it would take? Bioinformatics has played an important role trying to help specialists to analyze data of a specific genome. The application of information technology, associated with techniques from applied mathematics, informatics, statistics, and computer science, has allowed the discovering of interesting and important characteristics in genomes, allowing to understand and solve several biological problems, or even to generate more knowledge or insight about the problem and its involved biological processes, what can bring advances in the used techniques. In Computing area, for example, an ordinary type of task is to process texts. There are several problems involving strings, like trying to find a specific word (we could say \u201cto align words\u201d) or a similar one (considering a particular pattern of characters) in a text. When processing genomic data, if it is desired to search for a specific pattern (and its approximations) in DNA sequences, the natural way is to use solutions already implemented. Thus, for pattern (exact or not) search and similar problems, bioinformaticians have developed computational tools that apply techniques and algorithms well-known in Computing area in order to solve these important genomic problems. Sometimes, they need to adapt algorithms for considering specific features of the biological problem. Two good examples of this case are Sequence Aligning and Sequence Assembly, processes resulting of adaptations in algorithms in order to consider insertion, deletion, and substitution of nucleotides in DNA sequences. Some statistical and computational techniques, such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Stochastic Grammars, and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) have been successfully applied for modeling, analysis, discovery, classification, and alignment of biological sequences (Yoon & Vaidyanathan, 2004, 2005).

Indeed, most of them are scanning the documents and publishing the resulting images without their corresponding transcriptions. This seriously limits the document exploitation possibilities. When the transcription is necessary, it is manually performed by human experts, which is a very expensive and error-prone task. Obtaining transcriptions to the level of required quality demands the intervention of human experts to review and correct the resulting output of the recognition engines. To this end, it is extremely useful to provide interactive tools to obtain and edit the transcription. ::: ::: Although text recognition is the final goal, several previous steps (known as preprocessing) are necessary in order to get a fine transcription from a digitized image. Document cleaning, enhancement, and binarization (if they are needed) are the first stages of the recognition pipeline. Historical Handwritten Documents, in addition, show several degradations, stains, ink-trough and other artifacts. Therefore, more sophisticated and elaborate methods are required when dealing with these kind of documents, even expert supervision in some cases is needed. Once images have been cleaned, main zones of the image have to be detected: those that contain text and other parts such as images, decorations, versal letters. Moreover, the relations among them and the final text have to be detected. Those preprocessing steps are critical for the final performance of the system since an error at this point will be propagated during the rest of the transcription process. ::: ::: The ultimate goal of the Document Image Analysis pipeline is to receive the transcription of the text (Optical Character Recognition and Handwritten Text Recognition). During this thesis we aimed to improve the main stages of the recognition pipeline, from the scanned documents as input to the final transcription. We focused our effort on applying Neural Networks and deep learning techniques directly on the document images to extract suitable features that will be used by the different tasks dealt during the following work: Image Cleaning and Enhancement (Document Image Binarization), Layout Extraction, Text Line Extraction, Text Line Normalization and finally decoding (or text line recognition). As one can see, the following work focuses on small improvements through the several Document Image Analysis stages, but also deals with some of the real challenges: historical manuscripts and documents without clear layouts or very degraded documents. ::: ::: Neural Networks are a central topic for the whole work collected in this document. ::: Different convolutional models have been applied for document image cleaning and enhancement.

In this paper, a novel nonlinear hybrid model aiming at improving prediction performance of wind speed called LSTMDE-HELM is presented by using Long Short Term Memory neural network (LSTM), Hysteretic Extreme Learning Machine (HELM), Differential Evolution algorithm (DE), and nonlinear combined mechanism. First, to enhance the performance of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), a biological neural system property called hysteresis is embedded into neuron activation function of ELM. Second, as there isn\u2019t a clear knowledge to set the number of hidden layers in LSTM and neurons count in each hidden layer, DE is introduced to optimize these numbers by minimizing a weighted objective function for keeping balance between learning performance and model complexity. Finally, the forecasting results of each predictor in LSTMDE-HELM are aggregated by a novel nonlinear combined mechanism composed of LSTM network and also the DE is used to optimize this LSTM. The proposed nonlinear hybrid model is employed on the data gathered from a wind farm in Inner Mongolia, China. Two forecasting horizons i.e., ten-minute ahead (utmost short term) and one-hour ahead (short term) are adopted for experiments.

In this paper, we have analyzed the performance of nine widely used machine learning classifiers--Bayes Net, NB, artificial neural network, support vector machines, K nearest neighbors, AdaBoost, Bagging, Zero R, and Random Forest for software fault prediction. Two standard sampling techniques--SMOTE and Resample with substitution are used to handle the class imbalance problem.

Using training data collected from a speech dynamics lab study with 12 participants, we show that our algorithm can identify each respiration cycle with 96.34% accuracy even in presence of walking. We present a Conditional Random Field, Context-Free Grammar (CRF-CFG) based conversation model, called rConverse, to classify respiration cycles into speech or non-speech, and subsequently infer conversation episodes.

Thus, developing algorithms to quickly solve such problems its of great interest to the field. We focus in this thesis on two of the most widely used models, the Lasso and Support Vector Machines. The former belongs to the family of regularization methods, and it was introduced in 1996 to perform both variable selection and regression at the same time. This is accomplished by adding a l1-regularization term to the least squares model, achieving interpretability and also a good generalization error. Support Vector Machines were originally formulated to solve a classification problem by finding the maximum-margin hyperplane, that is, the hyperplane which separates two sets of points and its at equal distance from both of them. SVMs were later extended to handle non-separable classes and non-linear classification problems, applying the kernel-trick. A first contribution of this work is to carefully analyze all the existing algorithms to solve both problems, describing not only the theory behind them but also pointing out possible advantages and disadvantages of each one. Although the Lasso and SVMs solve very different problems, we show in this thesis that they are both equivalent. Following a recent result by Jaggi, given an instance of one model we can construct an instance of the other having the same solution, and vice versa. This equivalence allows us to translate theoretical and practical results, such as algorithms, from one field to the other, that have been otherwise being developed independently. We will give in this thesis not only the theoretical result but also a practical application, that consists on solving the Lasso problem using the SMO algorithm, the state-of-the-art solver for non-linear SVMs. We also perform experiments comparing SMO to GLMNet, one of the most popular solvers for the Lasso. The results obtained show that SMO is competitive with GLMNet, and sometimes even faster. Furthermore, motivated by a recent trend where classical optimization methods are being re-discovered in improved forms and successfully applied to many problems, we have also analyzed two classical momentum-based methods: the Heavy Ball algorithm, introduced by Polyak in 1963 and Nesterov\u2019s Accelerated Gradient, discovered by Nesterov in 1983. In this thesis we develop practical versions of Conjugate Gradient, which is essentially equivalent to the Heavy Ball method, and Nesterov\u2019s Acceleration for the SMO algorithm. Experiments comparing the convergence of all the methods are also carried out. The results show that the proposed algorithms can achieve a faster convergence both in terms of iterations and execution time.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2779053179", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125353518"}

This paper describes an accurate floor colour sensor and presents experimental results to show its effectiveness at classifying different surfaces using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The sensor is mounted under the robot with its own light source, thus avoiding extraneous light and classifies only the floor that the robot is currently travelling over. The sensor is applied to the calibration problem of correcting systematic odometry errors of a differential drive robot. This can improve SLAM map quality by segmenting the environment into distinct regions with different odometry calibration parameters. Region based calibration of odometry is achieved using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and correlative laser scan matching. This paper uses an odometry correction cost function derived from graph SLAM to show experimentally that the calibration with multiple classified regions is superior to calibration without floor classification.

To address this issue, educational games should include game levels that can self-adjust to the specific needs of individual students. However, creating a large number of adaptable game levels requires considerable effort by game developers. A promising solution to this problem is to leverage procedural content generation to automatically generate levels for educational games that incorporate the desired learning objectives. In this paper, we propose a multistep deep convolutional generative adversarial network for generating new levels within a game for middle school computer science education. The model operates in two phases: (1) train a generator with a small set of human-authored example levels and generate a much larger set of synthetic levels to augment the training data for a second generator, and (2) train a second generator using the augmented training data and use it to generate novel educational game levels with enhanced solvability.

This is done by using a Dialectical Generative Adversarial Network (Dialectical GAN) to generate high-quality SAR images. This method is based on the analysis of hierarchical SAR information and the \u201cDialectical\u201d structure of GAN frameworks. As a demonstration, a typical example will be shown where a low-resolution SAR image (e.g., a Sentinel-1 image) with large ground coverage is translated into a high-resolution SAR image (e.g., a TerraSAR-X image). Three traditional algorithms are compared and a new algorithm is proposed based on a network framework by combining conditional WGAN-GP (Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network - Gradient Penalty) loss functions and spatial gamma matrices under the rule of dialectics. Experimental results show that the SAR image translation works very well when we visually compare the results of our proposed method with the selected traditional methods. ::: Translation of Sentinel-1 data to TerraSAR-X image resolution has attracted great interest within the remote sensing community. First, the high resolution of TerraSAR-X generates SAR images rich in information that allow new innovative applications. Second, the wide area coverage of Sentinel-1 images reduces the need for multiple acquisitions, and decreases the demand for high-cost data. Third, it is much easier for researchers to access Sentinel-1 images than TerraSAR-X images because the Sentinel-1 images are freely available, while the TerraSAR-X images are usually commercial. ::: For validation, we used images of urban areas, so we can apply a spatial matrix to extract geometrical arrangement information. Our method learns an adaptive loss function based on the image pairs at hand, and is regularized by the prescribed image style, which makes it applicable to the task of SAR image translation.

Preliminary experiments spanning five languages with different training data sizes (i.e., 5k and 50k parallel sentences) show a significant performance gain ranging from +3.85 up to +13.63 BLEU in different language directions.

An important question is how to combine the individual rules to obtain a useful classifier. In some instances, converting each learned rule into a binary feature for a Bayes net learner improves the accuracy compared to the standard decision list approach [3,4,14]. This results in a two-step process, where rules are generated in the first phase, and the classifier is learned in the second phase. We propose an algorithm that interleaves the two steps, by incrementally building a Bayes net during rule learning. Each candidate rule is introduced into the network, and scored by whether it improves the performance of the classifier. We call the algorithm SAYU for Score As You Use.

Manual detection and quantification of stroke lesions is a time-consuming and cumbersome process. In this paper, we present a novel automatic method to detect acute ischemic stroke lesions from Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) volumes using textural and unsupervised learned features. The proposed method proficiently exploits the 3D contextual evidence using a patch-based approach, which extracts patches randomly from the input MR volumes. Textural feature extraction (TFE) using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and unsupervised feature learning (UFL) based on k-means clustering approaches are employed independently to extract features from the input patches. These features obtained from the two feature extractors are then given as input to the Random Forest (RF) classifier to discriminate between normal and lesion classes. A hybrid approach based on the combination of TFE using GLCM and UFL based on the k-means clustering is proposed in this work. Hybrid combination approach results in more discriminative feature set compared with the traditional approaches.

First, crop pests and diseases account for a large proportion of crop disasters. Secondly, it is the main reason that restricts the production of high efficiency, high quality and high yield of crops. As a large agricultural country, crop pests and diseases occur in a wide variety and have a wide range of impacts, causing huge losses to China's grain production. In order to provide a basis for reasonable control of crop pests and diseases, it is necessary to timely identify the actual disaster situation of crops. In the traditional crop damage detection, due to the backwardness of technology, people have to use the method of visual observation to detect and occur the specific situation of crop pests and diseases and to judge the way of the outbreak of pests and diseases. The traditional method is not only a waste of time but also not very efficient, and the monitoring effect is not high. Therefore, in order to effectively increase the level of monitoring and accuracy, it is necessary to make rational use of hyperspectral remote sensing technology. In this paper, the common pests and diseases of rice are taken as the research object. The monitoring on the regional scale is the main line of research. The remote sensing satellite image data and the environmental and disaster monitoring and forecasting small satellite images are used as data sets to study the remote sensing monitoring models and methods of rice pests and diseases. In this paper, a method of Remote Sensing Extraction of crop disaster information based on support vector machine is proposed.

In this paper, we describe the annotation schema, the curation of a corpus of prescription instructions through a manual annotation effort, and initial experiments in modeling and automated generation of TranScriptML representations.ResultsTranScriptML was developed in the process of curating a corpus of 2914 ambulatory prescriptions written within the Partners Healthcare network, and its schema is informed by the content of that corpus. We developed the representation schema as a novel set of semantic tags for prescription concept categories (e.g. frequency); each tag label is defined with an accompanying attribute framework in which the meaning of tagged concepts can be specified in a normalized fashion. We annotated a subset (1746) of this dataset using cross-validation and reconciliation between multiple annotators, and used Conditional Random Field machine learning and various other methods to train automated annotation models based on the manual annotations. The TranScriptML schema implementation, manual annotation, and machine learning were all performed using the MITRE Annotation Toolkit (MAT). We report that our annotation schema can be applied with varying levels of pairwise agreement, ranging from low agreement levels (0.125 F for the relatively rare REFILL tag) to high agreement levels approaching 0.9 F for some of the more frequent tags. We report similarly variable scores for modeling tag labels and spans, averaging 0.748 F-measure with balanced precision and recall. The best of our various attribute modeling methods captured most attributes with accuracy above 0.9.ConclusionsWe have described an annotation schema for prescription regimens, and shown that it is possible to annotate prescription regimens at high accuracy for many tag types.

This paper focuses on the application of Gaussian Process (GP) in optimizing combustion process for reducing NOx emission of a 330 MW boiler. GP is used to model the relationship between the NOx emission characteristic and boiler operation parameters. The hyperparameters of the GP model are optimized via Genetic Algorithm (GA). Based on 670 sets of production data from the 330 MW tangentially fired boiler, two GP models with 13 and 21-inputs are developed, respectively. The experimental result shows that the 21-inputs model provides better prediction performance than 13-inputs model does. The comparison between Support Vector Machines (SVM) and GP is also given under the 21-inputs circumstance. The influences of some inputs are investigated separately. Then, the predicted NOx emission is used as the objective of searching the optimal parameters for the boiler combustion. Under a given production combustion condition, the NOx decreases from 345 ppm to 238 ppm via optimizing the boiler operational parameters using the 21-inputs GP model, which is a reasonable achievement for the coal fired combustion process.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.energy.2018.01.003", "venue": null, "journal": "Energy", "mag_id": "2782538413", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["199489943", "75137341", "53033759", "210931949"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:117227949"}

However, epileptic seizure prediction from EEG signals is quite challenging since it has more fluctuating information about the behaviour of the brain. Analyzing such long-term EEG signals to discriminate between interictal versus ictal regions is a difficult task. Also, EEG signals can be affected by noises from different sources. The proposed work presents an efficient approach based on Weighted Visibility Graph (WVG) for seizure prediction. In this work, the EEG signals are filtered to remove the artifacts due to power supply noise and then the filtered EEG time series data is segmented. The segmented time series data is converted into a complex network called WVG. This WVG inherits the dynamic characteristics of the EEG signal from which it is created. Features like mean degree, mean weighted degree and mean entropy are extracted from the WVG. These features are used to derive the essential characteristics of EEG from the WVG. Finally, classification is done using Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Images of objects with either flat-field or structured illumination are paired with registered optical property maps and are used to train conditional generative adversarial networks that estimate optical properties from a single input image. We benchmark this approach by comparing GANPOP to a single-snapshot optical property (SSOP) technique, using a normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) metric. In human gastrointestinal specimens, GANPOP with a single structured-light input image estimates the reduced scattering and absorption coefficients with 60% higher accuracy than SSOP while GANPOP with a single flat-field illumination image achieves similar accuracy to SSOP. When applied to both in vivo and ex vivo swine tissues, a GANPOP model trained solely on structured-illumination images of human specimens and phantoms estimates optical properties with approximately 46% improvement over SSOP, indicating adaptability to new, unseen tissue types.

Especially supervised classification techniques, which learn from labeled examples, have shown good performance. However, a disadvantage of supervised methods is their reduced performance on data different from the training data, for example on images acquired with different scanners. Reducing the amount of manual annotations required for each new dataset will facilitate widespread implementation of supervised methods. In this paper we segment carotid plaque components of clinical interest (fibrous tissue, lipid tissue, calcification and intraplaque hemorrhage) in a multi-center MRI study. We perform voxelwise tissue classification by traditional same-center training, and compare results with two approaches that use little or no annotated same-center data. These approaches additionally use an annotated set of different-center data. We evaluate 1) a nonlinear feature normalization approach, and 2) two transfer-learning algorithms that use same and different-center data with different weights. Results showed that the best results were obtained for a combination of feature normalization and transfer learning. While for the other approaches significant differences in voxelwise or mean volume errors were found compared with the reference same-center training, the proposed approach did not yield significant differences from that reference. We conclude that both extensive feature normalization and transfer learning can be valuable for the development of supervised methods that perform well on different types of datasets.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "25532205", "doi": "10.1109/TMI.2014.2384733", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2071617033", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6254331", "36785267", "7082231", "21060237", "45176982", "16446366", "38232275", "45129346", "205212601", "1940818", "196379668", "68452817", "15739022", "42007885", "24276315", "14299771", "13921726", "12700546", "19268856", "51939782", "19194059", "173182752", "740063", "11695825", "15127540", "37563289", "25310609", "8007617", "16557601", "5239096", "46439274", "46522255", "1100509"], "inbound_citations": ["4803898", "4903005", "3622792", "371179", "4061248", "51610043", "51719291", "4879138", "50772610", "25020573", "3746421", "209391575"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:206748861"}

We describe a set of sufficient conditions for unsupervised representation learning to provide a benefit, as measured by this risk gap. These conditions decompose the problem of when representation learning works into its constituent parts, which can be separately evaluated using an unlabeled sample, suitable domain-specific assumptions about the joint distribution, and analysis of the feature learner and subsequent supervised learner. We provide two examples of such conditions in the context of specific properties of the unlabeled distribution, namely when the data lies close to a low-dimensional manifold and when it forms clusters.

The method utilizes 3D car models to generate car poses, groups them into four pairs of viewpoint orientation: 1) front / back view, 2) top left / bottom right view, 3) top right / bottom left view, and 4) left side / right side view, then builds car detectors corresponding to each orientation.

In the testing stage, for every frame captured from a webcam, the hand is detected using our algorithm, then, the keypoints are extracted for every small image that contains the detected hand gesture only and fed into the cluster model to map them into a bag-of-words vector, which is finally fed into the multiclass SVM training classifier to recognize the hand gesture.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TIM.2011.2161140", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2119656522", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["130535382", "12315239", "1969816", "17281157", "6509212", "8014237", "235084", "36579869", "1636365", "288876", "461853", "15612889", "15199783", "122759122", "7359186", "961425", "14561315", "53904563", "20338551", "6119206", "2773627", "44708800", "42155698", "15690378", "1893154", "15116821", "2209704", "9160576", "158578", "67808", "31399383", "10087484", "207252020", "8777811", "9824161", "12365014", "3155054", "17740922", "1457124", "15284075", "6890163", "7549619", "16703037", "1956774", "6242337", "5607238", "913000", "1756419", "14872042", "33658532", "6674067", "5931565", "11013114"], "inbound_citations": ["50784434", "206651700", "2761833", "18185219", "43390407", "40636835", "15757638", "10857378", "566572", "211090650", "14784284", "283705", "3319906", "22606743", "22236017", "57756062", "198134940", "208646778", "21671376", "17307099", "3424794", "16775620", "46460549", "56598390", "24420206", "14971751", "14130607", "52151487", "211120427", "55959405", "38788630", "26661164", "24008641", "204822557", "145862536", "2580500", "2704990", "14542333", "210164453", "2463300", "1778277", "57253704", "43614132", "15104671", "13903616", "9861440", "24898931", "16920387", "54036048", "16665464", "14867801", "2552693", "10289644", "54463858", "46977875", "4922029", "44044900", "59619459", "53109899", "202561831", "16286470", "60943653", "208304212", "18305550", "1075569", "46817381", "15295341", "213193359", "14294654", "115946911", "38349084", "207757300", "198325393", "2284272", "25846516", "56211346", "16989198", "23325824", "58006658", "45562848", "15713704", "22385894", "33663363", "201852478", "4246583", "21319816", "96426741", "13327406", "18227642", "51922113", "7089606", "17546135", "63026641", "17265303", "23545931", "6402328", "16932044", "4383010", "18743756", "115449692", "14157372", "18224448", "117924647", "51971992", "208615102", "6305124", "2921488", "24962470", "4646632", "36825006", "16205326", "25639948", "20714798", "209382619", "111389421", "111389421", "25939755", "181528203", "7311029", "15957292", "29067127", "3523601", "53441169", "8354849", "39042503", "86667367", "55924079", "16384065", "41302555", "150373747", "13967572", "13967572", "28733441", "127980196", "2183491", "2763989", "18720131", "147165", "14382356", "11495702", "202700395", "6601027", "61391424", "206597741", "12358420", "5108312", "214625346", "49473363", "19837768", "206704402", "27123139", "38143212", "22868587", "9287047", "17847896", "20885872", "41366225", "18478691", "53368214", "46046414", "6689045", "71146311", "12065360", "16704808", "12876947", "24548712", "32442539", "201254302", "9170090", "14688719", "54171391", "23930532", "28478043", "51684383", "213177151", "2046047", "25018268", "6696170", "9996527", "53073947", "38564895", "12981388", "1556504", "57378060", "210888746", "6729104", "14378373", "12272666", "11161716", "25582158", "55190322", "196196999"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:34795221"}

It has existed since the birth of the security market. Until 2018, the history of the Chinese security market is less than 30 years, nonetheless, insider trading behavior frequently occurred. In this study, we mainly explore the features of insider trading behavior by studying relevant indicators during the sensitive period (time window length before the release of insider information). For this purpose, an intelligent system with an integration method of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Random Forest (RF) is proposed to identify insider tradings in Chinese security market. In the proposed method, we first collect twenty-six relevant indicators for insider trading samples that occurred from 2007 to 2017 and corresponding non-insider trading samples in Chinese security market. Next, by using the PCA, indicator dimension is reduced and principal components are extracted. Then, relations between insider trading samples and principal components are learnt by the RF algorithm. In the identification phase, the trained PCA-RF model is applied to classify the insider trading and non-insider trading samples, as well as analyzing the relative importance of indicators for insider trading identification. Experimental results showed us that under the 30-, 60-, and 90-days time window lengths, recall results of the proposed method for the out-of-samples identification were 73.53%, 83.87%, and 79.41%, respectively. We further investigate the voting threshold of RF for the proposed method, and we found when the voting threshold of RF was increased to more than 70%, the proposed method produced identification accuracy up to more than 90%. In addition, the relative importance result of RF indicated that three indicators were crucial for insider trading identification. Moreover, identification accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method were substantially superior to benchmark methods. In summary, experimental results indicated that the proposed method could be efficiently applied to Chinese security market. Thus, the proposed method can provide useful suggestions to market regulators for insider trading investigations.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10614-020-09970-8", "venue": null, "journal": "Computational Economics", "mag_id": "3005324591", "mag_field_of_study": ["Economics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214097560"}

Therefore, technological improvements allow the development of a traffic sign detection system that assists drivers in their commute. Some challenges in this kind of research are weather condition, traffic signs positions, and obstructed view of traffic signs by the other vehicles and advertisement boards. This research has developed a model of traffic sign detection system using color segmentation by transforming the RGB color range into HSI to detect traffic signs based on the colors of red, yellow, blue and green, which are further morphologically processed to minimize searching scope with erosion and labeling.

Fraudulent activities cause a greater impact on the company because the loss of revenue results in the loss of the gain due to expenses to be paid to global partners to provide an international call interconnection. Therefore IDD call fraud continues to be a concern among all IDD call service providers by developing various methods to overcome the problem. The objective of this paper is to propose a method to detect fraud suspects on IDD call services which combines the advantages of hybrid NBTree and Kullback Leibler divergence (KL-divergence or KLD).

The goal is to label the pixels corresponding to a defect with a minimum of false positives. A common approach is to run a sliding-window classifier over the image. Recent Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs), such as U-Net, can be trained to identify pixels corresponding to abnormalities given a suitable training set. However in many application domains it is hard to collect large numbers of defect examples (by their nature they are rare). Although U-Net can work in this scenario, we show that better results can be obtained by replacing the final softmax layer of the network with a Random Forest (RF) using features sampled from the earlier network layers. We also demonstrate that rather than just thresholding the resulting probability image to identify defects it is better to compute Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSERs).

Sparse representation based appearance modeling has received an increasing amount of interest in recent years. However, most of existing work utilizes reconstruction errors to compute the observation likelihood under the generative framework, which may give poor performance, especially for significant appearance variations. In this paper, we advocate an approach to visual tracking that seeks an appropriate metric in the feature space of sparse codes and propose a metric learning based structural appearance model for more accurate matching of different appearances. This structural representation is acquired by performing multiscale max pooling on the weighted local sparse codes of image patches. An online multiple instance metric learning algorithm is proposed that learns a discriminative and adaptive metric, thereby better distinguishing the visual object of interest from the background. The multiple instance setting is able to alleviate the drift problem potentially caused by misaligned training examples. Tracking is then carried out within a Bayesian inference framework, in which the learned metric and the structure object representation are used to construct the observation model. Comprehensive experiments on challenging image sequences demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TCSVT.2013.2291283", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2024463467", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["124304921", "18640898", "17100949", "5674143", "1315786", "10355303", "15725489", "7299089", "14397939", "9247097", "14324401", "11736804", "30378777", "62091811", "11105983", "37034831", "7027533", "7932397", "2074143", "7995734", "16555962", "6237022", "6821810", "1089627", "206590783", "2164761", "208933582", "10519006", "33077524", "2539545"], "inbound_citations": ["2439109", "30319097", "27029320", "96432211", "3438547", "25036067", "53590987", "16470090", "131768577", "13106253", "3411489", "3436736", "2501759", "26809311", "7315537", "12256608", "2780311", "208035142", "3416102", "54437376", "29482778", "3295267", "3495868", "1963413", "12963690", "53691742", "16444730", "2986250", "1592336", "4664195", "5000147", "1459471"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3431891"}

Modern mobile devices- such as feature phones, smart phones, tablets, and net books- are internet-capable and feature various convenient hardware capabilities for building and managing social relationships between people. Text and speech enriched with emotions is one of the major ways of exchanging ideas, especially via telephony and SNS. By analyzing a voice stream using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Log Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (LFPC) based system, different emotions can be recognized.

ILP provides first-order logic representations of the derived hypotheses that are useful for reasoning and planning processes. Furthermore, it can use background knowledge to represent more advanced rules. Partially specified world states can also be easily represented in these rules.

This paper studies the near ship-to-ship collision situations using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data set. The first part of the study defines a near collision criterion by two existing mathematical and statistical models. Defining this ship domain considers factors such as Speed over Ground (SOG), Course over Ground (COG), width of the ship and the length of the ship etc. In the second part, the study defines the selected ship domain and the near collision criterion with the real-time AIS dataset extracted from the USA coastal area. Application of the ship domain and near collision criterion requires handling a large volume of AIS data. In this study, AIS data of one month on one coastal zone consists of approximately 25 million of data records.

In this paper, we address the problem of saccadic scanpath prediction by introducing an iterative representation learning framework. Within the framework, saccade can be interpreted as an iterative process of predicting one fixation according to the current representation and updating the representation based on the gaze shift. In the predicting phase, we propose a Bayesian definition of saccade to combine the influence of perceptual residual and spatial location on the selection of fixations. In implementation, we compute the representation error of an autoencoder-based network to measure perceptual residuals of each area. Simultaneously, we integrate saccade amplitude and center-weighted mechanism to model the influence of spatial location. Based on estimating the influence of two parts, the final fixation is defined as the point with the largest posterior probability of gaze shift. In the updating phase, we update the representation pattern for the subsequent calculation by retraining the network with samples extracted around the current fixation.

Some noise in the measured features is not much of a problem, it even increases the performance of many Machine Learning (ML) techniques. But for noise in the labels (mislabeled data) the situation is quite different, label noise deteriorates the performance of all ML techniques. The research question addressed in this paper is to what extent can one detect mislabeled data using a committee of supervised Machine Learning models. The committee under consideration consists of a Bayesian model, Random Forest, Logistic classifier, a Neural Network and a Support Vector Machine. This committee is applied to a given data set in several iterations of 5-fold Cross validation. If a data sample is misclassified by all committee members in all iterations (consensus) then it is tagged as mislabeled. This approach was tested on the Iris plant data set, which is artificially contaminated with mislabeled data. For this data set the precision of detecting mislabeled samples is 100% and the recall is approximately 5%. The approach was also tested on the Touch data set, a data set of naturalistic social touch gestures. It is known that this data set contains mislabeled data, but the amount is unknown. For this data set the proposed method achieved a precision of 70% and for almost all other tagged samples the corresponding touch gesture deviated a lot from the prototypical touch gesture.

In this article, we focus on the spatiotemporal context-aware POI recommendation, which considers the joint effect of time and location for POI recommendation. Inspired by the recent advances in knowledge graph embedding, we propose a spatiotemporal context-aware and translation-based recommender framework (STA) to model the third-order relationship among users, POIs, and spatiotemporal contexts for large-scale POI recommendation. Specifically, we embed both users and POIs into a \u201ctransition space\u201d where spatiotemporal contexts (i.e., a pair) are modeled as translation vectors operating on users and POIs. We further develop a series of strategies to exploit various correlation information to address the data sparsity and cold-start issues for new spatiotemporal contexts, new users, and new POIs. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our STA framework achieves the superior performance in terms of high recommendation accuracy, robustness to data sparsity, and effectiveness in handling the cold-start problem.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3295499", "venue": "TOIS", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2914041468", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["58792962", "9095914", "51609740", "8785978", "9091060", "16657829", "12592499", "1480192", "14873341", "1642908", "14990290", "1772271", "13364278", "5575601", "16687120", "49484132", "10246046", "13907106", "11129957", "18681507", "1107407", "10083034", "15095982", "2949428", "5891915", "2168938", "13824827", "15510183", "13392386", "12203396", "6121276", "26823313", "1049546", "51607087", "4833213", "14351725", "15027084", "207242555", "3183015", "753311", "4237425", "17663978", "207204773", "6900929", "17443225", "18080268", "207204246", "17540582", "2859106", "6491073", "12230889"], "inbound_citations": ["211068921", "164212183", "211526208", "210929990", "204837497", "207943997", "204837423", "207756548", "208130430", "195657811"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59337573"}

The pedestrian classifier of the SVM (Support Vector Machines) has been trained with pedestrian's typical characteristics. This paper mainly studies the efficient algorithms of splitting pedestrian target from other non-pedestrians. As the pedestrians in the image will show different shapes, postures and sizes, and they are usually in different light conditions, it is complicate to describe the pedestrians. This paper proposes a pedestrian segmentation method, which effectively solves the problems, making the classifier be able to deal with the complicate problems. Secondly, the paper uses the pedestrian image texture and shape features to describe the pedestrian. The extracted features are taken as the input of SVM. In order to solve the impact of lighting and other factors to pedestrian recognition, some characteristics have been considered, such as the pedestrian's grayscale images have certain gray symmetry and texture features, and the pedestrians successive edge makes outline of the image features clear. By using lots of events to train the SVM algorithm the recognized pedestrian classification can be obtained. The test results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively recognize different pedestrians in front of the vehicle and get a good real-time effect.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/DCABES.2012.108", "venue": "2012 11th International Symposium on Distributed Computing and Applications to Business, Engineering & Science", "journal": "2012 11th International Symposium on Distributed Computing and Applications to Business, Engineering & Science", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1976298877", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["38288198", "110116406"], "inbound_citations": ["198334693", "14520202"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13013603"}
