The results showed that ANNs led to better outcomes with Determination Coefficient (DC)=0.62 than ad hoc LSSVMs with DC=0.59.

Due to doubts concerning wind power and the influence of natural factors such as weather, unpredictability, and the risk of system operation increase, wind power seems less reliable than traditional power generation. An accurate and reliable prediction of wind power would enable a power dispatching department to appropriately adjust the scheduling plan in advance according to the changes in wind power, ensure the power quality, reduce the standby capacity of the system, reduce the operation cost of the power system, reduce the adverse impact of wind power generation on the power grid, and improve the power system stability as well as generation adequacy. The traditional back propagation (BP) neural network requires a manual setting of a large number of parameters, and the extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm simplifies the time complexity and does not need a manual setting of parameters, but the loss function in ELM based on second-order statistics is not the best solution when dealing with nonlinear and non-Gaussian data. For the above problems, this paper proposes a novel wind power prediction method based on ELM with kernel mean p-power error loss, which can achieve lower prediction error compared with the traditional BP neural network. In addition, to reduce the computational problems caused by the large amount of data, principal component analysis (PCA) was adopted to eliminate some redundant data components, and finally the efficiency was improved without any loss in accuracy.

The proposed algorithm, named Learn++.NSE, learns from consecutive batches of data without making any assumptions on the nature or rate of drift; it can learn from such environments that experience constant or variable rate of drift, addition or deletion of concept classes, as well as cyclical drift. The algorithm learns incrementally, as other members of the Learn++ family of algorithms, that is, without requiring access to previously seen data. Learn++.NSE trains one new classifier for each batch of data it receives, and combines these classifiers using a dynamically weighted majority voting. The novelty of the approach is in determining the voting weights, based on each classifier's time-adjusted accuracy on current and past environments. This approach allows the algorithm to recognize, and act accordingly, to the changes in underlying data distributions, as well as to a possible reoccurrence of an earlier distribution. We evaluate the algorithm on several synthetic datasets designed to simulate a variety of nonstationary environments, as well as a real-world weather prediction dataset. Comparisons with several other approaches are also included. Results indicate that Learn++.NSE can track the changing environments very closely, regardless of the type of concept drift.

Our framework adapts a global optimization algorithm employing an hv-block cross-validation metric, pertinent for models with serially correlated economic variables, to produce robust sets of tuning parameters for SRV kernel functions. In contrast to previous approaches identifying a single \"best\" tuning parameter setting, a task that is pragmatically improbable to achieve in many applications, we proceed with a collection of tuning parameter candidates, employing the Model Confidence Set test to select the most accurate models from the collection of promising candidates. Using bond credit spread data for three large emerging market economies and an array of input variables motivated by economic theory, we apply our framework to identify relatively small sets of SVR models with su perior out-of-sample forecasting performance. Benchmarking our SRV forecasts against random walk and conventional linear model forecasts provides evidence for the notably superior forecasting accuracy of SRV-based models. In contrast to routinely used linear model benchmarks, the SRV-based models can generate accurate forecasts using only a small set of input variables limited to the country-specific credit-spread-curve factors, lending some support to the rational expectation theory of the term structure in the context of emerging market credit spreads. Consequently, our evidence indicates a better ability of highly flexible SVR to capture investor expectations about future spreads reflected in today's credit spread curve.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.17016/feds.2019.074", "venue": null, "journal": "Social Science Research Network", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2980701004", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7229610", "158611447", "26204665", "2365515", "14475198", "198642093", "7197585", "12090811", "9139725", "155050514", "54733892", "88516979", "15393173", "18071442", "18073068", "154578109", "118875765", "21488845", "56154566", "207673395", "207690484", "31552176", "15480929", "55640970", "153022981", "7138354", "3917886", "121912338"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204893842"}

With the increase in the number of genes, simple feature selection methods show poor performance for both selecting the effective and informative features and capturing biological information.

This system performs forced alignment of speech data and phonemic transcription of corresponding text. A de-biasing algorithm first refines initial boundary estimates. SVM models are then used for more refinement of de-biased boundaries. Subsequently, a LBG vector quantization algorithm is used to reduce the amount of speech for training SVM models.

We propose to use the spatial correlation of received signal strength (RSS) inherited from wireless nodes to detect the spoofing attacks. We then formulate the problem of determining the number of attackers as a multiclass detection problem. Cluster-based mechanisms are developed to determine the number of attackers. When the training data are available, we explore using the Support Vector Machines (SVM) method to further improve the accuracy of determining the number of attackers.

One of the key components of MIR that has been actively researched into is music tagging. While significant progress has been achieved, most of the existing systems still adopt a simple classification approach, and apply machine learning classifiers directly on low level acoustic features. Consequently, they suffer the shortcomings of (1) poor accuracy, (2) lack of comprehensive evaluation results and the associated analysis based on large scale datasets, and (3) incomplete content representation, arising from the lack of multimodal and temporal information integration. In this paper, we introduce a novel system called MMTagger that effectively integrates both multimodal and temporal information in the representation of music signal.

In this study, the predictive power of support vector machine (SVM)-based statistical analysis was tested. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: The clinical records of 246 patients who underwent SNB at our institution were used for this analysis. The following clinicopathologic variables were considered: the patient's age and sex and the tumor's histological subtype, Breslow thickness, Clark level, ulceration, mitotic index, lymphocyte infiltration, regression, angiolymphatic invasion, microsatellitosis, and growth phase. The results of SVM-based prediction of SLN status were compared with those achieved with logistic regression. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The SLN positivity rate was 22% (52 of 234). When the accuracy was > or = 80%, the negative predictive value, positive predictive value, specificity, and sensitivity were 98%, 54%, 94%, and 77% and 82%, 41%, 69%, and 93% by using SVM and logistic regression, respectively. Moreover, SVM and logistic regression were associated with a diagnostic error and an SNB percentage reduction of (1) 1% and 60% and (2) 15% and 73%, respectively. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: The results from this pilot study suggest that SVM-based prediction of SLN status might be evaluated as a prognostic method to avoid the SNB procedure in 60% of patients currently eligible, with a very low error rate.

The network is a cascade of Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) modules, in which each module learns to cluster the differences between the input pattern and the selected category prototype at the previous module. Input patterns are first classified into a few broad categories, and successive ART modules find increasingly specific categories until a threshold is reached, the level of which can be controlled by a global parameter called \u201cresolution\u201d. The network thus essentially implements a divisive (or splitting) hierarchical clustering algorithm: hence the name HART-S (for \u201cHierarchical ART with Splitting\u201d). HART-S is also compared and contrasted to HART-J (for \u201cHierarchical ART with Joining\u201d), another variant that was proposed earlier by the first author.

This study presents batch and data streaming models to detecting adverse events using data from a war theater context. In all the previous studies, regression models and several machine learning techniques were used for predicting continuous values in an active theater of war, and the error values reported on the test sets were large. In order to overcome the shortcoming, this study investigates the effectiveness of batch and data streaming classification algorithms in detecting or classifying adverse events given infrastructure development spending data and other variables in an active theater of war in Afghanistan. By the feature selection, the valid input variables are obtained and their indexes show that the input variables are mainly the adverse events (t-1) at the previous month, the population densities and related project investments. From the country level, fewer of the 14 project investments affect the adverse events. From the region level, some projects with higher index values, such as Security in the South Western region, Energy and Emergency Assistance in the North Eastern region, and Education in the Eastern region are mainly affecting factors. Three batch classification methods and three data streaming classification methods were assessed for their ability to detect adverse events given infrastructure development data. The study uses cost-sensitive measures to address the very unbalanced nature of the data and it applies variable reduction techniques to identify significant variables. The three batch classification algorithms are C4.5, k-nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Machine. The three data streaming algorithms are Naive Bayes, Hoeffding Tree, and Single Classifier Drift. In general, the performance of the cost-sensitive methods in the batch setting is comparable to those in the data stream setting. However, in the batch setting the cost matrix needs to be adjusted manually. In contrast the data stream setting allows one to adjust the models based on the analysis of the classifiers\u2019 performance over time and changing data distribution. The Kappa values using Naive Bayes are the highest in the three data stream algorithms in the whole country and its regions. The Naive Bayes classifier has the best global performance. By the Kappa statistic curve, we can observe the concept drifts. In a region level, many models have a better performance including more investments related to project compared with those in a country level. In addition as data distribution becomes more balanced, the classifiers in the data stream setting outperform in terms of the overall classification rates in comparison to the classifiers in the batch setting. The results thus demonstrate the potential of data streaming algorithms to significantly outperform when the data become less unbalanced, and can be used for detecting adverse events in similar areas.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.engappai.2019.05.006", "venue": "Eng.

Existing systems for monitoring adverse drug events, such as the Federal Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS) in the US, have shown limited effectiveness due to the lack of incentives for healthcare professionals and patients. While social media present opportunities to mine information about adverse events in near real-time, there are still important questions to be answered in order to understand their impact on pharmacovigilance. First, it is not known how many relevant social media posts occur per day on platforms like Twitter, i.e., whether there is \"enough signal\" for a post-market pharmacovigilance program based on Twitter mining. Second, it is not known what other topics are discussed by users in posts mentioning pharmaceutical drugs. In this paper, we outline how social media can be used as a human sensor for drug use monitoring. We introduce a large-scale, near real-time system for computational pharmacovigilance, and use our system to estimate the order of magnitude of the volume of daily self-reported pharmaceutical drug side effect tweets. The processing pipeline comprises a set of cascaded filters, followed by a supervised machine learning classifier. The cascaded filters quickly reduce the volume to a manageable sub-stream, from which a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifier identifies adverse events based on a rich set of features taking into account surface-textual properties, as well as domain knowledge about drugs, side effects and the Twitter medium. Using a dataset of 10,000 manually annotated tweets, a SVM classifier achieves F1=60.4% and AUC=0.894. The yield of the classifier for a drug universe comprising 2,600 keywords is 721 tweets per day. We also investigate what other topics are discussed in the posts mentioning pharmaceutical drugs.

It is an incremental algorithm that works online, processing each example in constant time, and performing a single scan over the training examples. The system has been designed for numerical data. It uses analytical techniques to choose the splitting criteria, and the information gain to estimate the merit of each possible splitting-test. For multi-class problems the algorithm builds a binary tree for each possible pair of classes, leading to a forest of trees. To detect concept drift, we maintain, at each inner node, a naive-Bayes classifier. Statistical theory states that while the distribution of the examples is stationary, the online error of naive-Bayes will decrease, otherwise, the test installed at this node is not appropriate for the actual distribution of the examples. When this occurs, the entire sub tree rooted at this node is pruned. The use of naive-Bayes classifiers at leaves to classify test examples, and the use of naive-Bayes classifiers at decision nodes to detect changes in the distribution of the examples are directly obtained from the sufficient statistics required to compute the splitting criteria, without any additional computations. This aspect is a main advantage in the context of high-speed data streams. The experimental results show a good performance at the change of concept detection and also with learning the new concept.

The development of this emotion recognition system involved three stages: experiment setup for physiological sensing, signal preprocessing for the extraction of affective features and affective recognition using a learning system. Four signals: Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), Blood Volume Pulse (BVP), Pupil Diameter (PD) and Skin Temperature (ST) are monitored and analyzed to differentiate affective states in a computer user. A Support Vector Machine is used to perform the supervised classification of affective states between \"stress\" and \"relaxed\".

However, in many real applications, data are coming with multiple graphs, and it is non-trivial to adapt GCNs to deal with data representation with multiple graph structures. One main challenge for multi-graph representation is how to exploit both structure information of each individual graph and correlation information across multiple graphs simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel Multiple Graph Adversarial Learning (MGAL) framework for multi-graph representation and learning. MGAL aims to learn an optimal structure-invariant and consistent representation for multiple graphs in a common subspace via a novel adversarial learning framework, which thus incorporates both structure information of intra-graph and correlation information of inter-graphs simultaneously. Based on MGAL, we then provide a unified network for semi-supervised learning task.

We developed Smurf, a self-service SM solution that reduces the labeling effort by 43-76%, yet achieves comparable F1 accuracy. The key to make Smurf possible is a novel solution to efficiently execute a random forest (that Smurf learns via active learning with the lay user) over two sets of strings.

A so-called \\textit{Random Forest - Genetic Algorithm} (RFGA) hybrid prediction method is used to find an optimal set of relevant questions to pose to new users in the app. A complementary ad-hoc parameter-based question evaluation (PBQE) method which is used to identify questions that are relevant on an individual level, and to control the frequency at which questions are posed to recurrent users is also discussed. ::: ::: The RFGA method was able to identify a dozen highly predictive questions in a total set of 160 questions, and thus significantly reduce the dimensionality of the feature space. This reduction in the number of features increased the prediction root mean square error of the random forest from 0.11 to 0.15 ($\\in [0,1]$). However, as the main function of the algorithm is to differentiate between features based on their predictive power, and not provide an optimal prediction, this was considered a reasonable trade-off. ::: ::: The questions that were found to be predictive treated topics of self-esteem, relationships, sleeping habits, attitude towards food, sexuality and physical activity. These questions were formulated in an open way, with simple slider or yes/no answers, and it was found that such questions in general had greater predictive power than more specific questions, for example those with several alternatives. ::: ::: The PBQE method was able to identify relevant questions on an individual level and increase the probability of these questions being posed to the user, while reducing the frequency at which other, less relevant, questions are posed. ::: ::: In conclusion, the results show that it is indeed possible to use machine learning methods on mental health self-report data from apps, given that a sufficient volume of high-quality data is available. A key insight is that the formulation and format of the questions greatly affect their predictive power, and that questions should therefore be carefully constructed to be relevant.

Studies have explored the influence of culture in forming personalties, where differences in behaviours are observed. The advancement in communication technologies has opened the world and increased the cultural diversity. Therefore, understanding individual personalities is crucial for the enhancing the effectiveness in communication and for the development of an interconnected world. Such an understanding not only would guarantee smooth group interaction in workplace, education, and social environments, but also would allow for better resource utilization and role allocation for group members. Moreover, with the emergence of HCI technologies and affective computing, automation of personality assessment using non-verbal cues seems feasible. Acknowledging the differences in personality traits between cultures, several studies have analysed such traits clusters in different countries. However, given the unique culture of Arabs in general and Saudi Arabian in particular, personality traits distribution is yet to be investigated. This research investigates two aspects: (1) the distribution of personality types of individuals living in Saudi Arabia compared to other countries, and (2) the feasibility of automatically classifying personality types by analysing non-verbal cues during an interaction setting. To accomplish the first part of the this work, we used the big-five personality assessment survey, where a total of 232 individuals have responded. The results showed a slight difference in the personality assessment of individuals living in Saudi Arabia compare to other cultures. For the second part, we conduced physical interviews with eight subjects where their body actions are recorded. Several non-verbal features were extracted from the body movement (e.g. touching face) and used for automatic classification. The results are generally reasonable, where the accuracy on average was 67% using Support Vector Machines. The slight differences in the personality types from this study results compared suggest the uniqueness of Arab culture in general and Saudi culture in particular. Moreover, the automatic assessment of personality types using body language demonstrate a potential success.

Some papers have addressed special attention to applications regarding damage assessment, especially how these algorithms could be used to classify different structural conditions. Nevertheless, few works present techniques in which vibration signatures can be directly used to provide insights about possible modification processes. This paper proposes a novel approach in which the concept of Symbolic Data Analysis (SDA) is introduced to manipulate not only vibration data (signals) but also modal properties (natural frequencies and mode shapes). These quantities (transformed into symbolic data) are combined to three well-known classification techniques: Bayesian Decision Trees, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines. The objective is to explore the efficiency of this combined methodology. For this purpose, several numerical simulations are first performed for evaluating the probabilities of true detection (or true classification) in the presence of different damage conditions. Several noise levels are also applied to the data to attest the sensibility of each technique. Second, a set of experimental tests performed on a railway bridge in France is used to emphasize advantages and drawbacks of the proposed approach. Results show that the analysis combining the cited learning algorithms with the symbolic data concepts is efficient enough to classify and discriminate structural modifications with a high probability of true detection, either considering vibration data or modal parameters.

Given a graph G as input, our algorithm computes a sparsi-fier in a distributed way in O(n log 3 (n)) time, O(m log 3 (n)) work and O(n log(n)) memory, using only log(n) rounds of communication.

Thus, even if two mixture distributions have identical mixture components but different mixture proportions, the Wasserstein distance between them will be large. This often leads to undesired results in distance-based learning methods for mixture distributions. In this paper, we resolve this issue by introducing the Normalized Wasserstein measure. The key idea is to introduce mixture proportions as optimization variables, effectively normalizing mixture proportions in the Wasserstein formulation. Using the proposed normalized Wasserstein measure leads to significant performance gains for mixture distributions with imbalanced mixture proportions compared to the vanilla Wasserstein distance.

In this paper, we propose a model for transfer learning in collaborative filtering through MMMF to address the data sparsity issue. The latent feature matrices involved in MMMF are clustered and combined to generate a cluster-level rating pattern called codebook and a codebook transfer is used for transfer of information.

Data mining is basically used to uncover relevant information from web pages especially from the social networking sites. Merging data mining with other fields like text mining, NLP and computational intelligence we are able to classify tweets as good, bad or neutral. The main emphasis of this research is on the classification of emotions of tweets' data gathered from Twitter. In the past, researchers were using existing machine learning techniques for sentiment analysis but the results showed that existing machine learning techniques were not providing better results of sentiment classification. In order to improve classification results in the domain of sentiment analysis, we are using ensemble machine learning techniques for increasing the efficiency and reliability of proposed approach.

However, accumulation of multivariate EEG signals is not sufficient to unleash the power of multi-view information. Therefore, in this paper we propose a novel multi-view learning framework with a unified multidomain feature learning method for seizure epilepsy detection. We first apply a patient-specific channel selection mechanism to pick up seizure-relevant EEG channels and construct a multiview framework by adopting discrete wavelet transform (DWT) method to generalize selected five-channel signals into five sets of sub-band frequency components corresponding to five views, which enhances intra-view coherence and cross-view complementary efficiently. Moreover, a unified feature learning method within each view is proposed with common spatial patterns (CSP) for statistical and morphological features and a semi-supervised maximum mean discrepancy autoencoder (semi-MMDAE) for cross-channel time-frequency domain representations extraction. Instead of extracting sub-feature sets separately, unified feature learning procedure prevents overfitting problem and reduces redundant features efficiently.

The Indonesian Mind Map Generator 1 aims to help the user in easily making a Mind Map object. The system consists of several Indonesian natural language understanding tools such as Indonesian POS Tagger, Indonesian Syntactic Parser, and Indonesian Semantic Analyzer. The methods used for developing each of Indonesian natural language understanding tools are devised to such an extend that they are enable to alleviate the low availability of Indonesian language resources. For Indonesian POS Tagger, we employed HMM and subsequently enhanced the result by using affix tree. As for the Indonesian Syntactic Parser, we compared the performance of CYK and Earley parser, which are known as common dynamic algorithms in PCFG. The Indonesian Semantic Analyzer consists of several components such as lexical semantic attachment, reference resolution, and Semantic Analyzer itself that transforms the parse tree result into first order logic representation. In our work, instead of using a rich resource on semantic information for each vocabulary, we defined several rules for the lexical semantic attachment based on POS Tags and certain words. Finally, to develop the Mind Map generator, we used the radial drawing method to visualize the first order logic representation and we also built a Mind Map editor to allow a user in modifying the Mind Map result. To evaluate the result, we conducted the experiments for each component mentioned previously. The POS Tagger accuracy achieved 96.5%, the Syntactic Parser achieved accuracy of 47.22%, and the Semantic Analyzer achieved accuracy of 62.5%. The final result of Mind Map object was evaluated by 5 respondents. The results of evaluationshowed that, for the simple sentence, the Mind Map object can be easily understood. 1. Background Nowadays, many education systems employ Mind Map symbols in explaining concepts that can be understood easily by the students. The idea of Mind Map is to use picture and color combination, which is compatible with how the brain works(1). Since Mind Map is a popular concept, people try to develop Mind Map editors to help the other sin drawing a Mind Map. One of the drawbacks is that, in these Mind Map editors, user has to draw the object from scratch, which can demotivate the user to start using the Mind Map editor. To handle such problems, several researches proposed a Mind Map generator tool to help the user in preparing the Mind Map object. By using a Mind Map generator tool, one doesn't have to draw the Mind Map object from scratch. User can edit the result of Mind Map generator tool and shorten the effort to draw the Mind Map object. Unfortunately, the Mind Map generator tool is only available for English text(2)(3). In English Mind Map generator, the basic approach is to employ natural language understanding tool in transforming English text into other representations such as syntactical representation or semantic representation. There was no research or product on developing Mind Map generator for Indonesian language.

Extraction of stems from 3D data is achieved by using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers and height above ground filters that separate ground points from vertical stem features. Identification of stems from overhead imagery is achieved by finding the centroids of tree crowns extracted using a watershed segmentation algorithm. Matching of the two maps is achieved by using a robust Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm that determines the rotation and translation vectors to align the datasets. The alignment is used to calculate the absolute horizontal location of the vehicle. The method has been tested with real-world data and has been able to estimate vehicle geoposition with an average error of less than 2 m. It is noted that the algorithm\u2019s accuracy performance is currently limited by the accuracy and resolution of aerial orthoimagery used. The method can be used in real-time as a complement to the Global Positioning System (GPS) in areas where signal coverage is inadequate due to attenuation by the forest canopy, or due to intentional denied access.

The present work investigated the use of NIR to assess the internal quality of apples by determining three important factors namely Vitamin C, total polyphenol and sugar content. [Materials and Methods] In this study, a large amount of apple samples (n= 2500) have been collected to cover a broad variability. The dataset includes several varieties and cultivars harvested between 2004 and 2007. The spectra were acquired by a FOSS NIRSystems 6500 scanning monochromator (400-2500,2 nm) with the DCA module (Direct Contact Analysis). The instrument is placed upside down in order to place the fruit directly on the detector's window. To integrate the variability of the fruit, 4 measurements have been performed by rotating the apple. The Winisi III package was used for preparing the spectra and for visualization using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Calibration models have been developed by using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm built in a Matlab environment (Matlab 7.5.0 R2007b). The SVM models were optimized and validated by using an independent test set. Concerning the reference values, the content of vitamin C was determined by HPLC, the total polyphenol content was obtained by the Folin-Ciocalteau method and the sugar content was obtained on the basis of a polarimetric Brix determination. [Results and Discussion] The best validation results have been obtained with a Savitsky-Golay first derivative (9,2,1) as preprocessing. The accuracy obtained with the SVM regression technique (Table 1) allows a good estimate of the internal quality of entire apples. Figure 1 shows the scatter plot obtained on the validation set for the determination of Vitamin C. Although the content is rather low, as it is concentrated in the outer layer of the fruits, NIR in reflectance mode can still be used to determine low concentration levels of Vitamin C. These results indicates that NIR could be used in breeding programs to assess the internal quality of entire apples.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2224336069", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61853701"}

RF has shown great success in many real-world applications. However, the problem of learning from text data with class imbalance is a relatively new challenge that needs to be addressed. A RF algorithm tends to use a simple random sampling of features in building their decision trees. As a result, it selects many subspaces that contain few, if any, informative features for the minority class. Furthermore, the Gini measure for data splitting is considered to be skew sensitive and bias towards the majority class. Due to the inherent complex characteristics of imbalanced text datasets, learning RF from such data requires new approaches to overcome challenges related to feature subspace selection and cut-point choice while performing node splitting. To this end, we propose a new tree induction method that selects splits, both feature subspace selection and splitting criterion, for RF on imbalanced text data. The key idea is to stratify features into two groups and to generate effective term weighting for the features. One group contains positive features for the minority class and the other one contains the negative features for the majority class. Then, for feature subspace selection, we effectively select features from each group based on the term weights. The advantage of our approach is that each subspace contains adequate informative features for both minority and majority classes. One difference between our proposed tree induction method and the classical RF method is that our method uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier to split the training data into smaller and more balance subsets at each tree node, and then successively retrains the SVM classifiers on the data partitions to refine the model while moving down the tree. In this way, we force the classifiers to learn from refined feature subspaces and data subsets to fit the imbalanced data better. Hence, the tree model becomes more robust for text categorization task with imbalanced dataset. Experimental results on various benchmark imbalanced text datasets (Reuters-21578, Ohsumed, and imbalanced 20 newsgroup) consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed ForesTexter method. The performance of our proposed approach is competitive against the standard random forest and different variants of SVM algorithms.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.knosys.2014.06.004", "venue": "Knowl.

This study assessed the changes in LULC and ecosystem service values (ESVs) in the Afar National Regional State, Ethiopia, which experiences a rapid invasion by the alien tree Prosopis juliflora (Swartz DC). Landsat satellite data of 1986, 2000 and 2017 were used in Random Forest algorithm to assess LULC changes in the last 31 years, to calculate net changes for different LULC types and the associated changes in ESVs. Kappa accuracies of 88% and higher were obtained for the three LULC classifications. Post-classification change analyses for the period between 1986 and 2017 revealed a positive net change for Prosopis invaded areas, cropland, salt flats, settlements and waterbodies. The rate of Prosopis invasion was estimated at 31,127 ha per year. Negative net changes were found for grassland, bareland, bush-shrub-woodland, and natural forests. According to the local community representatives, the four most important drivers of LULC dynamics were climate change, frequent droughts, invasive species and weak traditional law. Based on two different ESVs estimations, the ecosystem changes caused by LULC changes resulted in an average loss of ESVs in the study area of about US$ 602 million (range US$ 112 to 1091 million) over the last 31 years. With an increase in area by 965,000 ha, Prosopis-invaded land was the highest net change during the study period, followed by grassland (\u2212599,000 ha), bareland (\u2212329,000 ha) and bush-shrub-woodland (\u2212327,000 ha).

However, these methods are subject to the curse of dimensionality: as the number of features grows large, poor generalization is to be expected and training becomes intractable due to high computational and memory costs. In this paper, we propose a similarity learning method that can efficiently deal with high-dimensional sparse data. This is achieved through a parameterization of similarity functions by convex combinations of sparse rank-one matrices, together with the use of a greedy approximate Frank-Wolfe algorithm which provides an efficient way to control the number of active features. We show that the convergence rate of the algorithm, as well as its time and memory complexity, are independent of the data dimension. We further provide a theoretical justification of our modeling choices through an analysis of the generalization error, which depends logarithmically on the sparsity of the solution rather than on the number of features.

Indeed, testing exhaustively the whole software system can be very difficult, heavily time and resources consuming. Using machine learning algorithms to predict which parts of a software system are fault-prone can help testers to focus on high-risk parts of the code and improve resources allocation. This paper aims to investigate the potential of a risk-based model to predict fault-prone classes. The risk of classes is evaluated based on two factors: the probability that a class is fault-prone and its impact on the rest of the system. We used object-oriented metrics to capture the two risk factors. The risk of a class is modeled using the Euclidean distance. We built various variants of the risk-based model using a data-set from five versions of the ANT system.

Such a huge representation and the enormous data bases used in proteomics require an effort mirrored in an increased processing time that must be reduced to an acceptable amount. Considering the present computation paradigm, the implementation of such systems shall take advantage of parallelization and concurrency. A special machine learning architecture based on SVM binary models and a neural network (NN) is proposed to handle the large multiclass problem of protein superfamily prediction, and parallelized through a multi-agent strategy that uses JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework) to reduce the total processing time when getting a prediction for a new query protein.

This work presents a novel second-order cone programming (SOCP) formulation, based on the LP-SVM formulation principle: the bound of the VC dimension is loosened properly using the l\"~-norm, and the margin is directly maximized using two margin variables associated with each class. A regularization parameter C is considered in order to control the trade-off between the maximization of these two margin variables. The proposed method has the following advantages: it provides better results, since it is specially designed for imbalanced classification, and it reduces computational complexity, since one conic restriction is eliminated.

To achieve our goal, a dataset of emotional Arabic tweets is constructed, where the emotion classes under consideration are: anger, disgust, joy and sadness. Moreover, we consider two classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB). The results of the tests show that the automatic labeling approaches using SVM and MNB outperform manual labeling approaches.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CSIT.2016.7549459", "venue": "2016 7th International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology (CSIT)", "journal": "2016 7th International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology (CSIT)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2515404780", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15587177", "15222577", "12195840", "17048722", "207196397", "14291749", "59906875", "16305768", "9388645", "16536236", "57749093", "14341556", "6064481", "18675180", "13861754"], "inbound_citations": ["57362617", "33978213", "32313493", "19125959", "211128781", "209383022", "4893109", "52966749", "52085597", "209497139", "202561499", "212439427", "207930581", "208034920", "67856311", "210910955", "51750739"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2788865"}

It employs a sensor array that endows the platform with a spatial-resolution capability. Given the difficulty of collecting data involving animal motion, a simulation tool was created with the aid of Blender and OpenGL software that is capable of quickly generating streams of human and animal-intrusion data. The generated data was then examined to identify a suitable collection of features that are useful in classification. The features selected corresponded to parameters that model the received signal as the super-imposition of a fixed number of chirplets, an energy signature and a cross-correlation parameter. The resultant feature vector was then passed on to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. This approach to classification was validated by making use of real-world data collected by the STP which showed both STP design as well as classification technique employed to be quite effective.

Firstly, an appropriate prediction method has to be chosen. Subsequently, the parameters of this prediction method have to be adjusted to the time series evolution. In particular, an accurate prediction of future customer demands is often difficult, due to several static and dynamic influences. As a promising prediction method, we propose a lazy learning algorithm based on phase space reconstruction and k-nearest neighbor search. This algorithm originates from chaos theory and nonlinear dynamics. In contrast to widely used linear prediction methods like the Box-Jenkins ARIMA method or exponential smoothing, this method is appropriate to reconstruct additional influences on the time series data and consider these influences within the prediction. However, in order to adjust the parameters of the prediction method to the observed time series evolution, a reasonable optimization algorithm is required. In this paper, we present a genetic algorithm for parameter optimization. In this way, the prediction method is automatically fitted accurately and quickly to observed time series data, in order to predict future values. The performance of the genetic algorithm is evaluated by an application to different time series of customer demands in production networks. The results show that the genetic algorithm is appropriate to find suitable parameter configurations.

Therefore, key generator is the heart of the stream cipher system. A system with traditional key generating techniques such as using the feedback shift register is vulnerable to cypher attacks which render it to be ineffective and insecure. A suggested novel method to overcome this problem is to use a Random Forest-Data Mining (RF-DM) algorithm. It incorporates using new types of linear and nonlinear functions to mix the plain text with the key in the encryption process and the cipher text with the reverse key in the decryption process. The method is successful in satisfying the secrecy goal of the stream cipher system because it uses two types of dual randomization to baffle the attacker or cryptanalysist. By mathematical logic and prove by experiments, we generate the key successfully by encrypting messages of different sizes . This proves the ablity to generated the unique key for each message based on its length without repeating the key in most cases. In addition, by combining the use of the random forest data mining technique as the randomizating principle in the ciperhing process makes it exteremely difficult for any attacker because the attacker does not have access or understanding of the not only the technique used but also the process to decipher.

Previous research successfully identified several common risk factors and proposed a variety of frameworks to predict ICU readmissions, whereas, some studies reported that many risk factors were too specific and/or had limited focus. This study aims to investigate and analyze if the relevance of ICU readmission risk factors may have changed overtime. We used MIMIC-III database with 42,307 ICU stays of 31,749 patients from a US hospital, related to medical services provided from 2001 to 2012. The dataset was initially split into two chronological subsets (2001\u20132008 and 2008\u20132012), and then split again into train (70%) and test (30%) datasets. The training datasets were rebalanced through undersampling technique. To identify if the most relevant risk factors changes over time, 13 variables (12 features and one class) were selected and a three-step machine learning approach was executed: (i) Numerical Analysis, to identify overall quantitative changes; (ii) Feature Correlation Value Analysis, to rank the most important risk factors in each subset and compare them to identify any significant changes; and (iii) Classifier Performance Analysis, to identify changes in the risk factors prediction capability, based on the three machine learning algorithms - Multilayer Perceptron, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine. When considering readmission rates, some changes were observed for patients using private insurance (variability of +3.0%) and first admitted in ICU through Medical Intensive Care Unit (\u22123.1%). Regarding the feature analysis, the two most relevant variables were the same in both datasets, having similar correlation value. When applying the machine learning algorithms in test datasets, the model presented similar results for both periods, achieving the best accuracy of 86.4%, and Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) of 0.642. The difference in AUC values between the first and the second periods varied up to 0.05 (better in the first dataset) and in accuracy up to 4% (better in the second period). Overall results indicate that the most relevant risk factors were stable over the years, with some minor changes.

The support vector machines (SVMs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been widely applied to forecast energy consumption of the DHS recently. However, the parameters of SVM and ANN are difficult to be optimized due to their specific request for inputs and time-consuming training process. To explore the performance of the decision tree-based ensemble algorithms in the return temperature prediction task of the DHS, four return temperature prediction models based on the operational data of a heating system in Tianjin are established, namely Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multilayer perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF) and light gradient boosting machine (LGBM). The RF and LGBM are two typical decision tree-based ensemble algorithms. The historical supply temperature, outdoor temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and air quality index (AQI) are used as original inputs of the models. For computational models (SVR, MLP), the input features should be further transformed. The experimental results demonstrate that the LGBM model outperforms others in all standard evaluation measures. It shows that the tree-based ensemble models without complicated feature transformation achieves considerable results. Moreover, a week-based time series data splitting strategy is developed and compared with the traditional method. The experimental results show that the novel method can improve the performance of models except MLP.

Current studies encourage the patient's involvement in their rehabilitation. Brain-Computer Interfaces are capable of decoding the cognitive state of users to provide feedback to an external device. On this paper, cortical information obtained from the scalp is acquired with the goal of studying the cognitive mechanisms related to the users' attention to the gait. Data from 10 healthy users and 3 incomplete Spinal Cord Injury patients are acquired during treadmill walking. During gait, users are asked to perform 4 attentional tasks. Data obtained are treated to reduce movement artifacts. Features from \u03b4(1 - 4Hz), \u03b8(4 - 8Hz), \u03b1(8 - 12Hz), \u03b2(12 - 30Hz), \u03b3low(30 - 50Hz), \u03b3high(50 - 90Hz) frequency bands are extracted and analyzed to find which ones provide more information related to attention. The selected bands are tested with 5 classifiers to distinguish between tasks. Classification results are also compared with chance levels to evaluate performance. RESULTS show success rates of \u223c67% for healthy users and \u223c59% for patients. These values are obtained using features from \u03b3 band suggesting that the attention mechanisms are related to selective attention mechanisms, meaning that, while the attention on gait decreases the level of attention on the environment and external visual information increases. Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine classifiers provide the best results for all users. RESULTS from patients are slightly lower, but significantly different, than those obtained from healthy users supporting the idea that the patients pay more attention to gait during non-attentional tasks due to the inherent difficulties they have during normal gait. This study provides evidence of the existence of classifiable cortical information related to the attention level on the gait. This fact could allow the development of a real-time system that obtains the attention level during lower limb rehabilitation. This information could be used as feedback to adapt the rehabilitation strategy.

Alpha power was not significantly different between conditions. These results were seen in the first minute and were maintained throughout the 10-min sessions. TM practice appears to (1) lead to a state fundamentally different than eyes-closed rest; (2) result in a cascade of events in the central and autonomic nervous systems, leading to a rapid change in state (within a minute) that was maintained throughout the TM session; and (3) be best distinguished from other conditions through autonomic and EEG alpha coherence patterns rather than alpha power. Two neural networks that may mediate these effects are suggested.

However, many ecological attributes are inherently continuous and classification of species composition into vegetation communities and discrete patches provides an overly simplistic view of the landscape. If one adopts a niche-based, individualistic concept of biotic communities then it may often be more appropriate to represent vegetation patterns as continuous measures of site suitability or probability of occupancy, rather than the traditional abstraction into categorical community types represented in a mosaic of discrete patches. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the high effectiveness of species-level, pixel scale prediction of species occupancy as a continuous landscape variable, as an alternative to traditional classified community type vegetation maps. We use a Random Forests ensemble learning approach to predict site-level probability of occurrence for four conifer species based on climatic, topographic and spectral predictor variables across a 3,883 km2 landscape in northern Idaho, USA. Our method uses a new permutated sample-downscaling approach to equalize sample sizes in the presence and absence classes, a model selection method to optimize parsimony, and independent validation using prediction to 10% bootstrap data withhold. The models exhibited very high accuracy, with AUC and kappa values over 0.86 and 0.95, respectively, for all four species. The spatial predictions produced by the models will be of great use to managers and scientists, as they provide vastly more accurate spatial depiction of vegetation structure across this landscape than has previously been provided by traditional categorical classified community type maps.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10980-009-9341-0", "venue": "Landscape Ecology", "journal": "Landscape Ecology", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2160486837", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["29375694", "207738357", "89141", "128674316", "2391953", "7308660", "64189607", "85214737", "8729571", "3626971", "16036351", "200062551", "133964372", "54807827", "85674550", "35041280", "41606011", "86591732", "126575034", "39361255", "131027032", "84110370", "10285111", "119553894", "55519914", "3705703", "126768356"], "inbound_citations": ["211208241", "29000373", "51690842", "59419985", "26152823", "13909001", "215387927", "92087202", "208910637", "25981890", "14625636", "14248094", "3360109", "209166393", "366410", "33604561", "16680102", "15924380", "56171658", "15032777", "5709417", "52061741", "43151461", "14096814", "14907305", "42552448", "2963728", "18161838", "37966051", "7925587", "12574264", "53560554", "215257036", "91889338", "61596432", "15477250", "84470201", "15102426", "134155091", "199545411", "129864719", "21959924", "128739760", "59068738", "52886818", "202022933", "74871425", "15510908", "211829722", "53692520", "18782423", "22320940", "55892213", "13690257", "4687997", "126931226", "208569085", "26725165", "215329463", "214851667", "214863511", "14860048", "13716743", "15114733", "311907", "51860642", "44283449", "24122243", "5981495", "91775551", "214945347", "67784234", "14464361", "24512539", "54903677", "52277759", "46993086", "85776913", "18086320", "43708079", "7142242", "133064798", "132846127", "197587638", "134072642", "23968898", "67866913", "1772615", "215158296", "90387995", "86605886", "215206563", "214831831", "533814", "134298254", "37493856", "52277620", "12454277", "199378215", "127160949", "196677296", "54458010", "157065386", "52198444", "131963336", "202853675", "14810852", "9508567", "56408774", "22744312"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:24596318"}

On the one hand, researchers developed plenty of theoretical analysis and methods concerning linear systems; on the other hand practitioners are often confronted with the apparent nonlinearity of the real world. Although several nonlinear identification and control techniques have been proposed in the last decades, these still appear to be less robust and reliable than their linear counterparts. An appealing approach to bridge the existing gap consists in decomposing a complex nonlinear control problem in a number of simpler linear problems, each associated with a restricted operating region. This paper will review a number of divide-and-conquer techniques proposed in the nonlinear control literature and more recently in the machine learning community to address the problem of linearly controlling a nonlinear system. Two families of divide-and-conquer approaches will be taken into consideration: analytical approaches which require the knowledge of the system dynamics and learning approaches which rely on powerful approximators to estimate a model from input/output data.

Dimensionality reduction is a means to reduce the burden of dimensionality due to large-scale data. Feature selection determines significant variables and contributes to dimensionality reduction. In recent years, the random forests method has been the focus of research because it can perform appropriate variable selection even with high-dimensional data holding high correlations between dimensionality. There exist many feature selection methods based on random forests. These methods can appropriately extract the minimum subset of important variables. However, these methods need more computation time than the original random forests method. An advantage of the random forests method is its speed. Therefore, this paper aims to propose a rapid feature selection method for highdimensional data. Rather than searching the minimum subset of important variables, our method aims to select meaningful variables quickly under the assumption that the number of variables to be selected is determined beforehand. Two main points are introduced to enable faster calculations. One is reduction in the calculation time of weak learners. The other is adopting two types of feature selection: \u201cfilter\u201d and \u201cwrapper.\u201d In addition, although most present methods use only \u201cmean decrease accuracy,\u201d we calculate the magnitude of features by combining \u201cmean decrease accuracy\u201d and \u201cGini importance.\u201d As a result, our method can reduce computation time in cases where generated trees have many nodes. More specifically, our method can reduce the number of important variables to 0.8% on an average without losing the information for classification. In conclusion, our proposed method based on random forests is found to be effective for achieving rapid feature selection.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "242239753", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15943670", "379259", "89141", "5707430", "15245447", "17064973", "14864905", "8397120", "8529157", "2827580", "2657379", "60993494", "206420153", "18717378", "1006989", "23369575", "26581201", "3093707"], "inbound_citations": ["40325044", "16518168", "11253100", "3686697", "37970494", "182449232", "67866417"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14505515"}

Essentially, alcohols, as cosolvent, contribute to the solvating characteristic of supercritical CO2, which is de facto required for (polar) compound extraction in different industries. However, the proposed, less time-consuming alternatives to experimentally measuring the vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) data have been successful in such non-ideal mixtures only to a certain extent. In particular, the observed high deviation in existing models from the experimental values in correlating VLE data necessitates developing an intelligent, self-learning, unique model with more accuracy as well as applicability to a notably broader range of conditions. To this end, we have employed a novel Least-Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) approach as a problem-independent, general-purpose tool. In this research, the LSSVM model is optimized with a Coupled Simulated Annealing (CSA) optimization algorithm. The hybrid model is based on a comprehensive databank of 531 reliable experimental VLE data that cover binary systems of CO2 + 13 types of short to medium chained alcohols at temperature and pressure overall ranges of 293.15\u2013432.45 K and 5.2\u2013213.91 bar, respectively. The statistical and graphical error analyses vividly demonstrate the supremacy and robustness of the developed CSA-LSSVM model, particularly compared to the conventional SRK and PR equations of state. However, minor deviations in mixtures containing Pentanol and Hexanol are observed, despite the overall model accuracy that strongly satisfies engineering purposes. We hypothesize that uncertainty in the corresponding experimental data could be the cause; we prove this by applying a Leverage approach, while studying the validity and applicability domain of the model.

We focus on the problem of tuning the regularization trade-off in the context of Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVMs) for function approximation and classification. By adopting an additive regularization trade-off scheme, the task of tuning the regularization trade-off with respect to a validation and cross-validation criterion can be written as a convex optimization problem. The solution of this problem then contains both the optimal regularization constants with respect to the model selection criterion at hand, and the corresponding training solution. We refer to such formulations as the fusion of training with model selection. The major tool to accomplish this task is found in the primal-dual derivations as occuring in convex optimization theory. The paper advances the discussion by relating the additive regularization trade-off scheme with the classical Tikhonov scheme. Motivations are given for the usefulness of the former scheme.

Though the discussion in this paper is limited to the application of SVR to snubbing in elastomeric isolators, the approach is generic and can be applied to other dynamic systems or to systems exhibiting hysteretic behavior. A theoretical model that represents the coupled dynamics of an isolation system with the corresponding snubbing system for a single degree-of-freedom system is proposed. The theoretical model is experimentally validated and is subsequently used to build a metamodel using SVR. The results of the metamodel are compared to the theoretical model for a simulation example and are found to be comparable, thereby reducing the computational time for the design and analysis of the snubbing system by orders of magnitude. The SVR based metamodel can, therefore, be used to substitute the computationally intense theoretical model for performing design iterations and design optimization of the snubbing system, significantly reducing model complexity as well as computational time during the design cycle.Copyright \u00a9 2010 by ASME", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1115/DETC2010-28117", "venue": "DAC 2010", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2002764441", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62595941"}

So far selection and design rationale for such peptides is usually driven by T-cell epitope prediction, available experimental and modelled 3D structure, B-cell epitope predictions such as hydrophilicity plots or experience. If no structure is available the rational selection of peptides for the production of functionally altering or neutralizing antibodies is practically impossible. Specifically if many alternative antigens are available the reduction of required synthesized peptides until one successful candidate is found is of central technical interest. We have investigated the integration of B-cell epitope prediction with the variability of antigen and the conservation of patterns for post-translational modification (PTM) prediction to improve over state of the art in the field. In particular the application of machine-learning methods shows promising results.ResultsWe find that protein regions leading to the production of functionally altering antibodies are often characterized by a distinct increase in the cumulative sum of three presented parameters. Furthermore the concept to maximize antigenicity, minimize variability and minimize the likelihood of post-translational modification for the identification of relevant sites leads to biologically interesting observations. Primarily, for about 50% of antigen the approach works well with individual area under the ROC curve (AROC) values of at least 0.65. On the other hand a significant portion reveals equivalently low AROC values of < = 0.35 indicating an overall non-Gaussian distribution. While about a third of 57 antigens are seemingly intangible by our approach our results suggest the existence of at least two distinct classes of bioinformatically detectable epitopes which should be predicted separately. As a side effect of our study we present a hand curated dataset for the validation of protectivity classification. Based on this dataset machine-learning methods further improve predictive power to a class separation in an equilibrated dataset of up to 83%.ConclusionWe present a computational method to automatically select and rank peptides for the stimulation of potentially protective or otherwise functionally altering antibodies. It can be shown that integration of variability, post-translational modification pattern conservation and B-cell antigenicity improve rational selection over random guessing. Probably more important, we find that for about 50% of antigen the approach works substantially better than for the overall dataset of 57 proteins. Essentially as a side effect our method optimizes for presumably best applicable peptides as they tend to be likely unmodified and as invariable as possible which is answering needs in diagnosis and treatment of pathogen infection.

The framework is used to present an extended overview of a multi-channel patient-independent neonatal seizure detection system based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: The appropriate framework for performance assessment of neonatal seizure detectors is discussed in terms of metrics, experimental setups, and testing protocols. The neonatal seizure detection system is evaluated in this framework. Several epoch-based and event-based metrics are calculated and curves of performance are reported. A new metric to measure the average duration of a false detection is proposed to accompany the event-based metrics. A machine learning algorithm (SVM) is used as a classifier to discriminate between seizure and non-seizure EEG epochs. Two post-processing steps proposed to increase temporal precision and robustness of the system are investigated and their influence on various metrics is shown. The resulting system is validated on a large clinical dataset of 267h. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: In this paper, it is shown how a complete set of metrics and a specific testing protocol are necessary to extensively describe neonatal seizure detection systems, objectively assess their performance and enable comparison with existing alternatives. The developed system currently represents the best published performance to date with an ROC area of 96.3%. The sensitivity and specificity were ~90% at the equal error rate point. The system was able to achieve an average good detection rate of ~89% at a cost of 1 false detection per hour with an average false detection duration of 2.7 min. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: It is shown that to accurately assess the performance of EEG-based neonatal seizure detectors and to facilitate comparison with existing alternatives, several metrics should be reported and a specific testing protocol should be followed. It is also shown that reporting only event-based metrics can be misleading as they do not always reflect the true performance of the system. ::: ::: ::: SIGNIFICANCE ::: This is the first study to present a thorough method for performance assessment of EEG-based seizure detection systems. The evaluated SVM-based seizure detection system can greatly assist clinical staff, in a neonatal intensive care unit, to interpret the EEG.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3036796", "pubmed_id": "20716492", "doi": "10.1016/j.clinph.2010.06.035", "venue": "Clinical Neurophysiology", "journal": "Clinical Neurophysiology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1988841943", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Psychology"], "outbound_citations": ["44648419", "26376483", "2100897", "24190612", "207159665", "22108433", "14455176", "10626219", "9040256", "35407548", "15549817", "2702042", "4534471", "207927251", "31675260", "1774892", "19879304", "46689236", "13463620", "5413260", "117643475", "40958164"], "inbound_citations": ["211060673", "12018050", "215683037", "1670328", "13957365", "18093200", "1716231", "15336543", "1720579", "5221853", "2092438", "202744848", "215672005", "10364626", "159040854", "15231798", "17879672", "15428264", "17922108", "4903023", "5787222", "203896365", "54810", "9817397", "9722538", "9280390", "12952693", "107472813", "34776302", "215617742", "5413260", "13671673", "206616158", "19586208", "7168640", "51702780", "14398313", "10569437", "46983346", "6425450", "61479493", "11295998", "16743153"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7683669"}

The critical issue for solving this problem is determining the method to be used for measuring the distance between two images. Among various methods, the large margin nearest neighbor (LMNN) method is a state-of-the-art algorithm. However, to compensate the LMNN\u2019s entangled data distribution due to high levels of appearance variations in unconstrained environments, DML\u2019s goal is to penalize violations of the negative pair distance relationship, i.e., the images with different labels, while being integrated with LMNN to model the distance relation between positive pairs, i.e., the images with the same label. The likelihoods of the input images, estimated using DML and LMNN metrics, are then weighted and combined for further analysis. Additionally, rather than using the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classification mechanism, we propose a verification mechanism that measures the correlation of the class label distribution of neighbors to reduce the false negative rate of positive pairs.

However, because of very limited available training samples and massive model parameters, DL methods may suffer from overfitting. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end 3-D lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) (abbreviated as 3-D-LWNet) for limited samples-based HSI classification. Compared with conventional 3-D-CNN models, the proposed 3-D-LWNet has a deeper network structure, less parameters, and lower computation cost, resulting in better classification performance. To further alleviate the small sample problem, we also propose two transfer learning strategies: 1) cross-sensor strategy, in which we pretrain a 3-D model in the source HSI data sets containing a greater number of labeled samples and then transfer it to the target HSI data sets and 2) cross-modal strategy, in which we pretrain a 3-D model in the 2-D RGB image data sets containing a large number of samples and then transfer it to the target HSI data sets. In contrast to previous approaches, we do not impose restrictions over the source data sets, in which they do not have to be collected by the same sensors as the target data sets.

Multiple observations by different laboratories indicate that protein complexes often follow consistent trends. However, proteomic data is often noisy and incomplete\u2013members of a complex may correlate only in a fraction of all experiments, or may not be always observed. Inclusion of potentially uninformative data hence imposes the risk of weakening such biological signals. We have previously used the Random Forest (RF) machine-learning algorithm to distinguish functional chromosomal proteins from \u2018hitchhikers\u2019 in an analysis of mitotic chromosomes. Even though it is assumed that RFs need large training sets, in this technical note we show that RFs also are able to detect small high-covariance groups, like protein complexes, and relationships between them. We use artificial datasets to demonstrate the robustness of RFs to identify small groups even when working with mixes of noisy and apparently uninformative experiments. We then use our procedure to retrieve a number of chromosomal complexes from real quantitative proteomics results, which compare wild-type and multiple different knock-out mitotic chromosomes. The procedure also revealed other proteins that covary strongly with these complexes suggesting novel functional links. Integrating the RF analysis for several complexes revealed the known interdependency of kinetochore subcomplexes, as well as an unexpected dependency between the Constitutive-Centromere-Associated Network (CCAN) and the condensin (SMC 2/4) complex. Serving as negative control, ribosomal proteins remained independent of kinetochore complexes. Together, these results show that this complex-oriented RF (nanoRF) can uncover subtle protein relationships and higher-order dependencies in integrated proteomics data.

The first-order jackknife richness estimator was used to estimate the completeness of such data in all terrestrial 1-degree cells world-wide. An \u03b1-shape procedure was used to build range maps capable of providing relatively accurate species richness and geographical rarity values for each grid cell. We also examined the explanatory capacity of a high number of environmental variables using multiple regressions and Support Vector Machine. ::: ::: Results ::: Cumulative species description curves show that a high number of species of freshwater fishes remain to be discovered. Completeness values indicate that only 199 one-degree grid cells, mainly located in eastern North America and Europe, could be considered as having relatively accurate inventories. Range maps provide species richness values that are positively and significantly related to those resulting from the first-order jackknife richness estimator. The relationship between species richness and geographical rarity is triangular, so that these species-rich cells are those with a higher proportion of distributionally rare species. Species richness is predicted by climatic and/or productivity variables but geographical rarity is not. ::: ::: Main conclusions ::: In general, species-rich tropical areas harbour a higher number of narrowly distributed species although comparatively species-poor subtropical cells may also contain narrowly distributed species. Historical factors may help to explain the faunistic composition of these latter areas; a supposition also supported by the low predictive capacity of climatic and productivity variables on geographical rarity values.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1111/ddi.12271", "venue": null, "journal": "Diversity and Distributions", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2086899146", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["85940785", "83939436", "2721435", "4494627", "7253370", "85736835", "215572582", "31394419", "9569240", "164195332", "86407535", "37376909", "60271866", "134612886", "84219896", "62536689", "54617386", "44903103", "51663086", "84725819", "15553479", "84877985", "16923932", "12455103", "10716010", "129085172", "9457954", "11955112", "12138303", "26581201", "55823221", "4414787", "86589140", "85923580", "17941488", "84911165", "206883572", "84660897", "83987235", "5684518", "36822090", "26083974", "13220158"], "inbound_citations": ["189517524", "23889541", "6451262", "213295559", "1896334", "49324043", "18207030", "90154599", "73531876", "52335864", "52979814", "34926995", "143424293", "73482020", "13841987", "89862671", "215312428", "13871726", "17525341", "87068189", "17273357"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:85000936"}

Existing research works usually increase the resolution of low-resolution image in the pixel space in order to provide better visual quality for human viewing. However, the improved performance of such methods is usually limited or even trivial in the case of very small image size (we will show it in this paper explicitly). In this paper, different from image super-resolution (ISR), we propose a novel super-resolution technique called feature super-resolution (FSR), which aims at enhancing the discriminatory power of small size image in order to provide high recognition precision for machine. To achieve this goal, we propose a new Feature Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (FSR-GAN) model that transforms the raw poor features of small size images to highly discriminative ones by performing super-resolution in the feature space. Our FSR-GAN consists of two subnetworks: a feature generator network G and a feature discriminator network D. By training the G and the D networks in an alternative manner, we encourage the G network to discover the latent distribution correlations between small size and large size images and then use G to improve the representations of small images. Extensive experiment results on Oxford5K, Paris, Holidays, and Flick100k datasets demonstrate that the proposed FSR approach can effectively enhance the discriminatory ability of features. Even when the resolution of query images is reduced greatly, e.g., 1/64 original size, the query feature enhanced by our FSR approach achieves surprisingly high retrieval performance at different image resolutions and increases the retrieval precision by 25% compared to the raw query feature.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CVPR.2018.00420", "venue": "2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "journal": "2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2798877493", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["206597351", "13271756", "1033682", "206594692", "206597034", "8964627", "9971732", "206593506", "211227", "98180", "12203312", "6875974", "11758569", "1563370", "14124313", "206592484", "6594838", "14083350", "4702087"], "inbound_citations": ["196470827", "214691735", "214802084", "211728794", "62841491", "214743552", "207906713"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52846727"}

The second component extracts supervised information by discovering topic experts of Q at time (t + \u0394t); that is, excluding those detected at time t, topic experts obtained at time (t + \u0394t) can be regarded as rising stars at time t. The third component is ELM-based future star classification that leverages ELM as a departure point to evaluate whether a user is a rising star. Our experimental studies conducted on real-world datasets show that (1) FS-ELM can effectively discover rising stars with a query topic at time t and outperform other traditional methods and (2) user social characteristics have an important impact on the rising star evaluation. This paper studies a novel problem, namely, rising star evaluation in geo-social networks. We propose an advanced processing framework based on ELM by exploiting social topology characteristics and user behavior patterns. The experimental results encouragingly demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s12559-019-09680-w", "venue": "Cognitive Computation", "journal": "Cognitive Computation", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2973174909", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3077937", "3177797", "1295858", "10353709", "61811788", "49354820", "11518324", "15589402", "116858", "24048074", "9466509", "3656914", "16442780", "5884835", "3907780", "8702526", "56170915", "10401626", "52908897", "21686720", "12985167", "38738579", "22746154", "14865880", "17023777"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202565060"}

However, relatively little research has focused on the use of the longwave infrared (LWIR, 8.0\u201312.5 \u03bcm) region for studies of vegetation. In this study LWIR leaf reflectance spectra were collected in the wet seasons (May through December) of 2013 and 2014 from twenty-six tree species located in a high species diversity environment, a tropical dry forest in Costa Rica. A continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) was applied to all spectra to minimize noise and broad amplitude variations attributable to non-compositional effects. Species discrimination was then explored with Random Forest classification and accuracy improved was observed with preprocessing of reflectance spectra with continuous wavelet transformation. Species were found to share common spectral features that formed the basis for five spectral types that were corroborated with linear discriminate analysis. The source of most of the observed spectral features is attributed to cell wall or cuticle compounds (cellulose, cutin, matrix glycan, silica and oleanolic acid). Spectral types could be advantageous for the analysis of airborne hyperspectral data because cavity effects will lower the spectral contrast thus increasing the reliance of classification efforts on dominant spectral features. Spectral types specifically derived from leaf level data are expected to support the labeling of spectral classes derived from imagery.

To demonstrate its usefulness, we develop two independent use cases for this parameterization: ::: 1. Mutual Information Maximization (MIM): MIM has become a popular means for self-supervised representation learning. Neural Bayes allows us to compute mutual information between observed random variables $\\mathbf{x}$ and latent discrete random variables $z$ in closed form. We use this for learning image representations and show its usefulness on downstream classification tasks. ::: 2. Disjoint Manifold Labeling: Neural Bayes allows us to formulate an objective which can optimally label samples from disjoint manifolds present in the support of a continuous distribution. This can be seen as a specific form of clustering where each disjoint manifold in the support is a separate cluster. We design clustering tasks that obey this formulation and empirically show that the model optimally labels the disjoint manifolds.

In an extreme case, there may be a complete lack of labeled data for one of the classes while, at the same time, there are adequate labeled examples for the others, accompanied by a large body of unlabeled data. Since most classification algorithms require some information about all classes involved, label estimation for the un-represented class is desired. An important representative of this group of problems is that of user interest/preference modeling where there may be a large number of examples of what the user likes with essentially no counterexamples.Recently, there has been much interest in applying the EM algorithm to incomplete data problems in the area of text retrieval and categorization. We adapt this approach to the asymmetric case of modeling user interests in news articles, where only labeled positive training data are available, with access to a large corpus of unlabeled documents. User modeling is here equivalent to that of user-specific document ranking. EM is used in conjunction with the Naive Bayes model while its output is also utilized by a Support Vector Machine and Rocchio's technique.Our findings demonstrate that the EM algorithm can be quite effective in modeling the negative class under a number of different initialization schemes. Although primarily just the negative training examples are needed, a natural question is whether using all of the estimated labels (i.e., positive and negative) would be more (or less) beneficial. This is important considering that, in this context, the initialization of the negative class for EM is likely not to be very accurate. Experimental results suggest that EM output should be limited to negative label estimates only.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1023/A:1012714523368", "venue": "Information Retrieval", "journal": "Information Retrieval", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1571139558", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1845092", "207228399", "15284993", "14683127", "14001779", "62249525", "33071665", "60981168", "207624573", "14229018", "62157473", "61116939", "6887471", "9885187", "28910096", "2427083", "11928371", "13189737", "42784570", "18370956", "17797070", "32800624", "915058", "7878162", "60757632", "14133176", "7311285", "13893154", "17243351", "9450903", "7464925", "686980", "6905768", "2769679", "1456996", "56563878", "60807209", "45186038", "60700469", "60700469", "7913028", "1713753", "7869993", "7377506"], "inbound_citations": ["16244855", "123128", "16635755", "18649539", "8501064", "7074012", "11202184", "3201514"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10052609"}

Classic optimization-based methods do not consider attribute interactions toward classification. Thus, a novel learning machine is needed to provide a better understanding on the nature of classification when the interaction among contributions from various attributes cannot be ignored. The interactions can be described by a non-additive measure while the Choquet integral can serve as the mathematical tool to aggregate the values of attributes and the corresponding values of a non-additive measure. As a main part of this research, a new nonlinear classification method with non-additive measures is proposed. Experimental results show that applying non-additive measures on the classic optimization-based models improves the classification robustness and accuracy compared with some popular classification methods. In addition, motivated by well-known Support Vector Machine approach, we transform the primal optimization-based nonlinear classification model with the signed non-additive measure into its dual form by applying Lagrangian optimization theory and Wolfes dual programming theory. As a result, 2n \u2013 1 parameters of the signed non-additive measure can now be approximated with m (number of records) Lagrangian multipliers by applying necessary conditions of the primal classification problem to be optimal. This method of parameter approximation is a breakthrough for solving a non-additive measure practically when there are relatively small number of training cases available (mn\uff0d1). Furthermore, the kernel-based learning method engages the nonlinear classifiers to achieve better classification accuracy.

In contrast, our approach does not require this assumption, thus enabling the algorithm to manage various non-parallel lane situations, such as are found at intersections, in splitting lanes, and in merging lanes. To detect multi-lane marks successfully in the absence of parallelism, we adopt Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), which are strong models for solving multiple association tasks. We show that CRFs are very effective tools for multi-lane detection because they find an optimal association of multiple lane marks in complex and challenging urban road situations.

The multi-angle approach has been proven useful for mapping vegetation types in desert grassland. The Multi-angle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR) provides 4 spectral bands and 9 angular reflectance. In this study, 44 classification experiments have been implemented to find the optimal combination of MISR multi-angular data to mine the information carried by MISR data as effectively as possible. These experiments show the following findings: 1) The combination of MISR's 4 spectral bands at nadir and red and near infrared bands in the C, B, and A cameras observing off-nadir can obtain the best vegetation type differentiation at the community level in New Mexico desert grasslands. 2) The k parameter at red band of Modified\u2013Rahman\u2013Pinty\u2013Verstraete (MRPV) model and the structural scattering index (SSI) can bring useful additional information to land cover classification. The information carried by these two parameters, however, is less than that carried by surface anisotropy patterns described by the MRPV model and a linear semi-empirical kernel-driven bidirectional reflectance distribution function model, the RossThin\u2013 LiSparseMODIS (RTnLS) model. These experiments prove that: 1) multi-angular reflectance raise overall classification accuracy from 45.8% for nadir-only reflectance to 60.9%. 2) With surface anisotropy patterns derived from MRPV and RTnLS, an overall accuracy of 68.1% can be obtained when maximum likelihood algorithms are used. 3) Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms can raise the classification accuracy to 76.7%.

Recent convolutional neural networks have demonstrated excellent performance for a variety of recognition tasks but typically require large amounts of manually annotated training data to perform well. This data is often costly to annotate and may introduce unwanted biases. In this thesis we investigate different ways how to reduce the amount and complexity of required training supervision. ::: In our first contribution, we propose a transfer learning approach with a convolutional neural network for object classification. We first learn mid-level features on the large ImageNet dataset during a pre-training phase, then we use the parameters to initialize another network designed for a smaller-scale task, where less training data is available. We show, first, that the image representations can be efficiently transferred to other visual recognition tasks, and second, that these representations lead to higher performance when more data is used for pre-training. We demonstratethat the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art on the Pascal VOC image classification task. ::: In our second contribution, we investigate weakly supervised learning for object recognition. We use the fact that for classification, convolutional neural networks tend to take decisions based on the most distinctive parts of objects. This allows us to build a network that can predict the location of objects, based on a weakly annotated dataset indicating only the presence or absence of objects but not their location in images. We demonstrate that our approach improves the state-of-theart on the Pascal VOC image classification task, performing on par with methods requiring full object-level supervision. ::: ::: In our third contribution, we look at possible paths for progress in unsupervised learning with neural networks. We study the recent Generative Adversarial Networks; these architectures learn distributions of images and generate new samples, but the evaluation which learned model is better than others is difficult. We propose a twosample test method for this evaluation problem, allowing us to perform a first level of model selection. We investigate possible links between Generative Adversarial Networks and concepts related to causality, and propose a two-sample test method for the task of causal discovery, outperforming the state of the art. Finally, building on a recent connection with optimal transport, we investigate what these generative algorithms are learning from unlabeled data.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2807621872", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67375723"}

Public health research will require cross-disciplinary interactions with the computer science community in working towards solutions to automatically recognise human activities from wearable sensor data. ::: ::: Methods: We conducted a meta-review of contemporary computing science and information retrieval approaches such as: 1) the management and indexing of data from wearable accelerometer and image capturing devices; 2) the synchronisation and fusion of data from multiple devices (e.g. GPS, accelerometer, & SenseCam data); and 3) the representation of the meaning of image data ::: ::: Results: We identified: 1) Relational databases offer the most flexible solution for managing, indexing, and querying wearable sensor data information. 2) Advanced analysis of the signature of streams of data from separate devices may allow their data to be synchronised, but requires further advances. 3) The optimum method of pattern recognition in automatically annotating wearable image data is through the use of Support Vector Machine classifiers. ::: ::: Conclusions: Close interdisciplinary research between public health and computing science can help further our understanding of human activities. A first step may be the use of sensor web technologies to recognise a well-defined subset of activities that individuals are engaged in.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1857381361", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:60493034"}

The fully developed version shows superior performance in 10 out of 12 evaluation criteria compared with the other participating gene finders, including Fgenesh++ and Augustus. An in-depth analysis of mGene's genome-wide predictions revealed that \u22482200 predicted genes were not contained in the current genome annotation.

As powerful ensemble learning methods in a machine learning (ML) domain, random forest (RF), and its variants Gradient boosting (GB), Extra-trees (ETs) always show good performance in handling non-parametric regressions.

Using a microfluidic single-cell migration chip and high-content imaging, we extracted morphological features and recorded migratory direction and speed of breast cancer cells. By applying a Random Decision Forest (RDF) and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), we achieved over 99% accuracy for cell movement direction prediction and 91% for speed prediction.

The Fake News Challenge (FNC-1) was organized in early 2017 to encourage the development of machine-learning-based classification systems for stance detection (i.e., for identifying whether a particular news article agrees, disagrees, discusses, or is unrelated to a particular news headline), thus helping in the detection and analysis of possible instances of fake news. This article presents a novel approach to tackle this stance detection problem, based on the combination of string similarity features with a deep neural network architecture that leverages ideas previously advanced in the context of learning-efficient text representations, document classification, and natural language inference. Specifically, we use bi-directional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), together with max-pooling over the temporal/sequential dimension and neural attention, for representing (i) the headline, (ii) the first two sentences of the news article, and (iii) the entire news article. These representations are then combined/compared, complemented with similarity features inspired on other FNC-1 approaches, and passed to a final layer that predicts the stance of the article toward the headline. We also explore the use of external sources of information, specifically large datasets of sentence pairs originally proposed for training and evaluating natural language inference methods to pre-train specific components of the neural network architecture (e.g., the RNNs used for encoding sentences). The obtained results attest to the effectiveness of the proposed ideas and show that our model, particularly when considering pre-training and the combination of neural representations together with similarity features, slightly outperforms the previous state of the art.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1811.00706", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3287763", "venue": "JDIQ", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2963058357,2899441423,2953577750", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["33719738", "13784491", "27322753", "14604520", "4494896", "11239727", "19172224", "52177991", "24462966", "5201925", "28971531", "49667762", "31308888", "20472740", "1915014", "20300138", "44121903", "1957433", "6628106", "9126867", "52341649", "14674248", "964287", "16432551", "5959482", "5037669", "28323588", "51812449", "11080756", "45779079", "52215843", "13514773", "19152001", "27764139", "52164698", "32573265", "52943910", "51943229", "13756489", "9026666", "4549072", "3432876", "4723212", "54580585", "6857205", "17400045", "38266719"], "inbound_citations": ["208176456", "214608539", "208310111"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53296504"}

For fully utilizing its benefits, developing a robust method to classify many objects of interests from huge amounts of laser point clouds is urgently required. Conditional Random Field (CRF) is a well-known discriminative classifier, which integrates local appearance of the observation (laser point) with spatial interactions among its neighbouring points in classification process. Typical CRFs employ generic label consistency using short-range dependency only, which often causes locality problem. In this paper, we present a multi-range and asymmetric Conditional Random Field (CRF) (maCRF), which adopts a priori information of scene-layout compatibility addressing long-range dependency. The proposed CRF constructs two graphical models, one for enhancing a local labelling smoothness within short-range (srCRF) and the other for favouring a global and asymmetric regularity of spatial arrangement between different object classes within long-range (lrCRF). This maCRF classifier assumes two graphical models (srCRF and lrCRF) are independent of each other. Final labelling decision was accomplished by probabilistically combining prediction results obtained from two CRF models.

If the data stream is imbalanced, it is even more difficult to detect concept drifts and make an online learner adapt to them. Ensemble algorithms have been found effective for the classification of streaming data with concept drift, whereby an individual classifier is built for each incoming data chunk and its associated weight is adjusted to manage the drift. However, it is difficult to adjust the weights to achieve a balance between the stability and adaptability of the ensemble classifiers. In addition, when the data stream is imbalanced, the use of a size-fixed chunk to build a single classifier can create further problems; the data chunk may contain too few or even no minority class samples (i.e., only majority class samples). A classifier built on such a chunk is unstable in the ensemble. In this article, we propose a chunk-based incremental learning method called adaptive chunk-based dynamic weighted majority (ACDWM) to deal with imbalanced streaming data containing concept drift. ACDWM utilizes an ensemble framework by dynamically weighting the individual classifiers according to their classification performance on the current data chunk. The chunk size is adaptively selected by statistical hypothesis tests to access whether the classifier built on the current data chunk is sufficiently stable. ACDWM has four advantages compared with the existing methods as follows: 1) it can maintain stability when processing nondrifted streams and rapidly adapt to the new concept; 2) it is entirely incremental, i.e., no previous data need to be stored; 3) it stores a limited number of classifiers to ensure high efficiency; and 4) it adaptively selects the chunk size in the concept drift environment. Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets containing concept drift show that ACDWM outperforms both state-of-the-art chunk-based and online methods.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31825880", "doi": "10.1109/TNNLS.2019.2951814", "venue": "IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems", "journal": "IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems", "mag_id": "2992362249", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209327378"}

Punctuality was defined as the difference between 'actual' and 'scheduled' check-in times, whereby negative values (i.e., early punctuality) were patients who checked-in early. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that patients checked-in late only a minority of the time (38% of visits). Additionally, examining punctuality by appointment hour slot we found that patients scheduled after 8AM had progressively earlier check-in times as the day progressed (P < .001 for trend). In both a Random Forest-Regression framework and linear regression models the most important risk-adjusted predictors of early punctuality were: later in the day appointment hour slot, patient having previously been to the hospital, age in the early 70s, and white race. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Patients attending a mixed population ambulatory HF clinic check-in earlier than scheduled times, with progressive discrepant intervals throughout the day. This finding may have significant implications for provider utilization and resource planning in order to maximize clinic efficiency. The impact of elective early arrival on patient's perceived wait times requires further study.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5685632", "pubmed_id": "29136649", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0187849", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2768566304", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["3433015", "46489579", "6517133", "5956609", "1769087", "2491118", "4468861", "61738921", "119972206", "72242102", "37618221", "28832528", "25673222", "35065257", "23989713", "32752890", "20278325", "43473529"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:20056563"}

Manual counting of mitosis is tedious and subject to considerable inter- and intra-reader variations. Aims: The aim is to investigate the various texture features and Hierarchical Model and X (HMAX) biologically inspired approach for mitosis detection using machine-learning techniques. Materials and Methods: We propose an approach that assists pathologists in automated mitosis detection and counting. The proposed method, which is based on the most favorable texture features combination, examines the separability between different channels of color space. Blue-ratio channel provides more discriminative information for mitosis detection in histopathological images. Co-occurrence features, run-length features, and Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) features were extracted and used in the classification of mitosis. Finally, a classification is performed to put the candidate patch either in the mitosis class or in the non-mitosis class. Three different classifiers have been evaluated: Decision tree, linear kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM), and non-linear kernel SVM. We also evaluate the performance of the proposed framework using the modified biologically inspired model of HMAX and compare the results with other feature extraction methods such as dense SIFT. Results: The proposed method has been tested on Mitosis detection in breast cancer histological images (MITOS) dataset provided for an International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2012 contest. The proposed framework achieved 76% recall, 75% precision and 76% F-measure. Conclusions: Different frameworks for classification have been evaluated for mitosis detection.

LSSVM classifiers are an alternative to SVM ones due to the training process of LSSVM classifiers only requires to solve a linear equation system instead of a quadratic programming optimization problem. However, the lost of sparseness in the Lagrange multipliers vector (i.e. the solution) is a significant drawback which comes out with theses classifiers. In order to overcome this lack of sparseness, we propose a novel GA approach to leave a few support vectors out of the solution without affecting the classifier's accuracy and even improving it. The main idea is to leave out outliers, non-relevant patterns or those ones which can be corrupted with noise and thus prevent classifiers to achieve higher accuracies along with a reduced set of support vectors. This algorithm is attractive when one seeks a competitive classifier with large datasets and limited computing resources.

We cluster the speakers using either their Vocal Tract Lengths (VTLs) or by using their speaker specific Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression (MLLR) super-vector, and build a separate Background Model (BM) for each such cluster. We show that the use of M-BMs provide improved performance when compared to the use of a single/gender wise Universal Background Model (UBM). While the computational complexity during test remains same for both M-BMs and UBM, M-BMs require switching of models depending on the claimant and also score-normalization becomes difficult. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel method which aggregates the information from Multiple Background Models into a single gender independent UBM and is inspired by conventional Feature Mapping (FM) technique. We show that using this approach, we get improvement over the conventional UBM method, and yet this approach also permits easy use of score-normalization techniques. The proposed method provides relative improvement in Equal-Error Rate (EER) by 13.65 % in the case of VTL clustering, and 15.43 % in the case of MLLR super-vector when compared to the conventional single UBM system. When AT-norm score-normalization is used then the proposed method provided a relative improvement in EER of 20.96 % for VTL clustering and 22.48 % for MLLR super-vector based clustering.

Though hyperspectral data gives accurate results than their multispectral counterparts, they are computationally more complex due to their high dimensionality. One of the classical problem while dealing with supervised hyperspectral classification is the class imbalance problem that arises due to the limited availability of samples for training. In order to deal with high dimensionality, many feature mining techniques has been proposed in literature for hyperspectral images. In this paper, we propose a hyperspectral image classification method based on two-dimensional Empirical Wavelet Transform (2D-EWT) feature extraction and compare it with that of Image Empirical Mode Decomposition (IEMD) based extracted features and raw features. Here, the focus is upon the fact that the number of features trained should be less than what is to be tested. Since the computational time for classification is also of prime importance, only some of the fast and best of the classifiers are selected. Sparse-based classifiers are one of the fast and efficient method for supervised classification of hyperspectral images. Subspace Pursuit (SP) and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithms are used in our experiments for sparse-based classification.

At the present state of technology, this poses a challenge to existing machine learning methods. We study this problem using a simple two-fingered gripper which learns to grasp an object with appropriate force, without slip while minimising chances of damage to the object. Three machine learning methods are used to produce a neurofuzzy controller for the gripper. These are off-line supervised neurofuzzy learning and two on-line methods, namely unsupervised reinforcement learning and an unsupervised/supervised hybrid. With the two on-line methods, we demonstrate that the controller can learn through interaction with its environment to overcome simulated failure of its sensors.

The specific goal of these techniques is to preserve local manifold structure in feature space while at the same time maximizing the separability between classes of feature vectors. In the manifold space, the relationships among the feature vectors are defined using nonlinear kernels. Two separate distance measures are used to characterize the kernels, namely the conventional Euclidean distance and a cosine-correlation based distance. The performance of the proposed techniques is evaluated on two task domains involving noise corrupted utterances of connected digits and read newspaper text. Performance is compared to existing approaches used for feature space transformations, including linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and locality preserving linear projections (LPP). The proposed approaches are found to provide a significant reduction in word error rate (WER) with respect to the more well-known techniques for a variety of noise conditions. Another contribution of the paper is to quantify the interaction between acoustic noise conditions and the shape and size of local neighborhoods which are used in manifold learning to define local relationships among feature vectors.

The process of feature construction by an ILP system, sometimes called \"propositionalization\", has been largely done either as a pre-processing step (in which a large set of possibly useful features are constructed first, and then a predictive model is constructed) or by tightly coupling feature construction and model construction (in which a predictive model is constructed with each new feature, and only those that result in a significant improvement in performance are retained). These represent two extremes, similar in spirit to filter and wrapper-based approaches to feature selection. An interesting, third perspective on the problem arises by taking search-based view of feature construction. In this, we conceptually view the task as searching through subsets of all possible features that can be constructed by the ILP system. Clearly an exhaustive search of such a space will usually be intractable. We resort instead to a randomised local search which repeatedly constructs randomly (but non-uniformly) a subset of features and then performs a greedy local search starting from this subset. The number of possible features usually prohibits an enumeration of all local moves. Consequently, the next move in the search-space is guided by the errors made by the model constructed using the current set of features. This can be seen as sampling non-uniformly from the set of all possible local moves, with a view of selecting only those capable of improving performance. The result is a procedure in which a feature subset is initially generated in the pre-processing style, but further alterations are guided actively by actual model predictions. We test this procedure on language processing task of word-sense disambiguation. Good models have previously been obtained for this task using an SVM in conjunction with ILP features constructed in the pre-processing style.

Moreover, there is still room for improving the classification performance due to the insufficient existing studies. Therefore, in order to improve the performance of classification based on the EEG data, we introduce a multi-view intact space learning method to characterize the EEG signals by feature extraction in a latent intact space.

Random forests (RF) have been successfully applied to data-driven mineral potential mapping using relatively small numbers of input maps that have typically been pre-classified by a geologist familiar with the mineral system being targeted. However, it is useful to understand how well RF perform for mineral potential mapping when a large number of multi-class categorical or non-thresholded numeric input maps are used in the classification or when weighted or ranked training data are used. Four different implementations of RF are presented to examine how the results vary depending on the degree of intervention from an expert in the modeling process. A case study has been devised using data from the eastern Lachlan Orogen in New South Wales (Australia) for the purposes of targeting porphyry Cu\u2013Au mineralization related to the Macquarie Arc. The results demonstrate that the use of a large number of multi-class categorical or non-thresholded numeric predictive input maps results in a poor mineral potential map outcome. An expert review to determine reclassifications or thresholds that produce geologically meaningful maps as proxies for the mineral system being targeted results in more effective RF-based mineral potential maps being produced. Weighting or ranking the deposits used as training data produces more narrowly defined prospective areas that may assist with targeting tier-one economic deposits. Comparison of the RF results to a standard weights of evidence analysis highlighted some significant differences in which predictive maps should be considered important for modeling, and in the extent of prospective area delineated from each output mineral potential map.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11053-019-09598-y", "venue": "Natural Resources Research", "journal": "Natural Resources Research", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2989837277", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["122210810", "55058842", "129504998", "128503818", "128331017", "89141", "127534335", "140724144", "129047892", "129071685", "10895910", "127632303", "129933245", "128748962", "62137670", "189978491", "129245118", "130561420", "33591867", "129906871", "129375649", "119621827", "134747948", "129689062", "129025050", "127824447", "140618933", "130101182", "131514886", "59900704", "6336016", "129774903", "86598757", "117960937", "198410366", "135221425", "198427904", "131501604"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208302771"}

Existing localization methods based on radio frequency (RF) and magnetic field suffer a great error due to the non-homogeneity of the human body and uncertain movement of the endoscopic capsule. In this paper, we developed a novel image classification technique to analyze the motion of the capsule. The proposed method segments the endoscopic images into sub-regions and classified them using Kernel Support Vector Machine (K-SVM). Our method performs better than the traditional pixel based classification methods since the quantized feature vector is able to better represent the image due to its natural resistant characteristic against the noises.

The introduction of efficient classification algorithms, such as boosting and Support Vector Machines, coping with high-dimensional data, generated new questions that Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) theory could not answer. The Empirical Risk Minimization principle does not account for practical learning algorithms and the VC dimension is not the appropriate concept to explain the generalization ability of such methods. In the first chapter, we recall the interpretations of boosting algorithms as implementations of convex risk minimization principles and we study their properties under this viewpoint. In particular, we show the importance of regularization in order to obtain consistent strategies. We also develop a new class of algorithms called the Mirror Averaging Algorithm and we evaluate their performance through simulation experiments. After presenting the fundamental ideas underlying boosting, we study, in the second chapter, more advanced issues such as oracle inequalities. Thus, we propose some fine calibration of the penalty function according to the cost function being used and present non-asymptotic results on the performance of penalized boosting estimators, with refinements such as fast rates of convergence under Mammen-Tsybakov margin conditions. We also describe the approximation properties of boosting using decision stumps. The third chapter explores the ranking problem. In applications such as information retrieval or credit scoring, ranking the instances can be much more significant than simply classifying them. We propose a simple formulation of this problem in which ranking is equivalent to classification with pairs of observations. The difference lies in the nature of the empirical risks which take the form of U-statistics and we develop classification theory in order to fit with this framework. We also investigate the possibilities of generalizing the ranking error in order to include priors on the ranking we are aiming at, for instance, when we want to focus only on the \"best\" instances.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2698018531", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125404580"}

The chosen template should have the best alignment with the target sequence since the three-dimensional structure of the target sequence is built on the sequence-template alignment. The traditional method for template selection is called Z-score, which uses a statistical test to rank all the sequence-template alignments and then chooses the first-ranked template for the sequence. However, the calculation of Z-score is time-consuming and not suitable for genome-scale structure prediction. Z-scores are also hard to interpret when the threading scoring function is the weighted sum of several energy items of different physical meanings. This paper presents a Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression approach to directly predict the alignment accuracy of a sequence-template alignment, which is used to rank all the templates for a specific target sequence.

This paper describes an adaptive method for ground labeling in 3D Point clouds, based on a local ground elevation estimation. The system proposes to model the ground as a Spatio-Temporal Conditional Random Field (STCRF). Spatial and temporal dependencies within the segmentation process are unified by a dynamic probabilistic framework based on the conditional random field (CRF). Ground elevation parameters are estimated in parallel in each node, using an interconnected Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm variant. The approach, designed to target high-speed vehicle constraints and performs efficiently with highly-dense (Velodyne-64) and sparser (Ibeo-Lux) 3D point clouds, has been implemented and deployed on experimental vehicle and platforms, and are currently tested on embedded systems (Nvidia Jetson TX1, TK1).

In addition, the SVM discrimination maps had greater overlap with the general linear model (GLM) analysis compared to the FLD. The analysis presents two phases: during the training, the classifier algorithm finds the set of regions by which the two brain states can be best distinguished from each other. In the next phase, the test phase, given an fMRI volume from a new subject, the classifier predicts the subject's instantaneous brain state.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id":

Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) and Relational Data Mining (RDM) address the task of inducing models or patterns from multi-relational data. One of the established approaches to RDM is propositionalization, characterized by transforming a relational database into a single-table representation. This paper presents a propositionalization technique called wordification which can be seen as a transformation of a relational database into a corpus of text documents. Wordification constructs simple, easy to understand features, acting as words in the transformed Bag-Of-Words representation. This paper presents the wordification methodology, together with an experimental comparison of several propositionalization approaches on seven relational datasets. The main advantages of the approach are: simple implementation, accuracy comparable to competitive methods, and greater scalability, as it performs several times faster on all experimental databases. Furthermore, the wordification methodology and the evaluation procedure are implemented as executable workflows in the web-based data mining platform ClowdFlows.

Therefore a system is proposed for prediction of the period and it is being done by examining a few character referred to as test characters in Tamil language. These test characters are sampled from the script automatically and matched with the characters available for different periods using machine intelligence. The proposed system here has various modules like binarization, thinning, segmentation, feature extraction and finally classification and period prediction using Support Vector Machine.

By implementing an efficient scheme of support vector regression, the target functions are retrieved by very large scale integrated circuits in one clock cycle with only 600 transistors. A set of dynamically tunable analog circuits are designed for generating various features of Gaussian kernel functions. By mixing these kernel functions, any specific complex function is computed by the regression. The ACU is designed and simulated in a standard CMOS technology for proof-of-concept. From the circuit simulation results, the proposed ACU calculates all the target functions with the average error less than 1.7%.

The features are like Orientation Histogram, Haar like, Fourier descriptors, DCT etc. Classification algorithms are included: Support Vector Machines, k-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) Feed forward, back propagation neural network, Distance Based Classifier, among others. Recognition accuracy is more than 90%, few achieve around 80%. However, most experiments were performed indoor under controlled environments, with specific lighting conditions, simple background, and were only using a small set of gestures. Comprehensive study provide introduction to automated Sign Language Recognition System reader and researcher and further facilitates future research efforts in this area.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2139/ssrn.3262581", "venue": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "journal": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "mag_id": "2904351606", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:69946160"}

Semantic segmentation is the problem of simultaneous segmentation and categorization of a partition of sensory data. The majority of current approaches tackle this using multi-class segmentation and labeling in a Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework or by generating multiple object hypotheses and combining them sequentially. In practical settings, the subset of semantic labels that are needed depend on the task and particular scene and labelling every single pixel is not always necessary. We pursue these observations in developing a more modular and flexible approach to multi-class parsing of RGBD data based on learning strategies for combining independent binary object-vs-background segmentations in place of the usual monolithic multi-label CRF approach. Parameters for the independent binary segmentation models can be learned very efficiently, and the combination strategy---learned using reinforcement learning---can be set independently and can vary over different tasks and environments.

Any new compound inhibiting this membrane-associated protein would notably affect the metabolism of physiologically important molecules and drugs, resulting in clinically significant drug-drug interactions. In search for computational tools to identify potential CYP2C9 inhibitors early in discovery, we present here the construction of filters based on 1100 structurally diverse molecules tested for CYP2C9 inhibition under identical conditions. Their chemical structures were encoded using various 2D descriptors including Three-Point Pharmacophoric (3PP) fingerprints, followed by generation of statistical models using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Partial Least Squares (PLS). This consistently led to significant and predictive models for regression and classification of CYP2C9 inhibitors. Their predictive ability was underscored by successfully applying them to different test sets of 238 diverse and 344 GPCR-targeted compounds. Even more important for early drug discovery is the ability of these models to correctly discriminate CYP2C9 inhibitors from inactive molecules. These models collectively are able to identify true CYP2C9 inhibitors with relatively low rates of false positives. The 3PP-based filter also allows visualizing important substructures and functional groups, which are linked to protein-ligand interactions for CYP2C9, as illustrated for selected structure-activity series. The application of these models to the substrate S-warfarin, recently co-crystallized with CYP2C9, revealed that the important substructures are indeed involved in the interaction with the CYP2C9 binding site. For example, the model correctly indicated aromatic stacking interactions with Phe114 and Phe476 as well as a hydrogen bond with Phe100. Hence, these models consistently provide guidelines for reducing CYP2C9 inhibition in novel candidate molecules.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1002/qsar.200630143", "venue": null, "journal": "Qsar & Combinatorial Science", "mag_id": "2044636211", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["56339433"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:97879711"}

Although there exist multiple pocket detection algorithms, they mostly employ a fairly simple ranking function leading to sub-optimal prediction results. We have developed a new pocket scoring approach (named PRANK) that prioritizes putative pockets according to their probability to bind a ligand. The method first carefully selects pocket points and labels them by physico-chemical characteristics of their local neighborhood. Random Forests classifier is subsequently applied to assign a ligandability score to each of the selected pocket point. The ligandability scores are finally merged into the resulting pocket score to be used for prioritization of the putative pockets.

The sensitivity to changes in water quality inherent to seagrass communities makes them vital for determining the overall health of the coastal ecosystem. Numerous efforts including community-based coastal resource management, conservation and rehabilitation plans are currently undertaken to protect these marine species. In this study, the relationship of water quality parameters, specifically chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and turbidity, with seagrass percent cover is assessed quantitatively. Support Vector Machine, a pixel-based image classification method, is applied to determine seagrass and non-seagrass areas from the orthomosaic which yielded a 91.0369% accuracy. In-situ measurements of chl-a and turbidity are acquired using an infinity-CLW water quality sensor. Geostatistical techniques are utilized in this study to determine accurate surfaces for chl-a and turbidity. In two hundred interpolation tests for both chl-a and turbidity, Simple Kriging (Gaussian-model type and Smooth- neighborhood type) performs best with Mean Prediction equal to \u22120.1371 FTU and 0.0061 \u03bcg/L, Root Mean Square Standardized error equal to \u22120.0688 FTU and \u22120.0048 \u03bcg/L, RMS error of 8.7699 FTU and 1.8006 \u03bcg/L and Average Standard Error equal to 10.8360 FTU and 1.6726 \u03bcg/L. Zones are determined using fishnet tool and Moran\u2019s I to calculate for the seagrass percent cover.

Esophageal pressure measurement is the gold-standard method to assess respiratory effort and identify these events.

However, their adoption has been slow due to their limited clinical validation, as the creation of manual, gold-standard validation sets by human experts is a cumbersome procedure. In this study, a new system is proposed for an objective automatic, gold-standard differentiation between obstructive and central hypopneas with the esophageal pressure signal. First, an overall of 356 hypopneas of 16 patients were manually scored by a human expert to create a gold-standard validation set. Then, features were extracted from each hypopnea to train and test classifiers (Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machines and adaboost classifiers) to differentiate between central and obstructive hypopneas with the gold-standard esophageal pressure signal. The automatic differentiation system achieved promising results, with a sensitivity of 0.88, a specificity of 0.93 and an accuracy of 0.90.

Trin. ex Steudel subspecies australis is one of the worst plant invaders in wetlands of North America. Remote sensing is the most cost-effective method to track its spread given its widespread distribution and rapid colonization rate. We hypothesize that the morphological and/or physiological features associated with different phenological states of Phragmites can influence their reflectance signal and thus affect mapping accuracies. We tested this hypothesis by comparing classification accuracies of cloud-free images acquired by Landsat 7, Landsat 8, and Sentinel 2 at roughly monthly intervals over a calendar year for two wetlands in southern Ontario. We used the Support Vector Machines classification and employed field observations and image acquired from unmanned aerial vehicle (8 cm) to perform accuracy assessments. The highest Phragmites producer\u2019s, user\u2019s, and overall accuracy (96.00, 91.11, and 88.56% respectively) were provided by images acquired in late summer and fall period. During this period, green, Near Infrared, and Short-Wave Infrared bands generated more unique reflectance signals for Phragmites. Both Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Normalized Difference Water Index showed significant difference between Phragmites and the most confused classes (cattail; Typha latifolia L., and meadow marsh) during the late summer and fall period. Since meadow marsh separated out best from Phragmites and cattail in the February image, we used it to mask the meadow marsh in the July image to reduce confusion. The unique reflectance signal of Phragmites in late summer and fall is likely due to prolonged greenness of Phragmites when compared to other wetland vegetation, large, distinct inflorescence, and the water content of Phragmites during this period.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11273-019-09675-2", "venue": "Wetlands Ecology and Management", "journal": "Wetlands Ecology and Management", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2955611820", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["26771400", "86684347", "128841985", "834676", "83863712", "9412289", "5838464", "85928769", "82631844", "88099925", "131119391", "15885432", "129314496", "130263993", "83483028", "59076046", "129654705", "129389231", "129029221", "1694147", "130438126", "21605657", "29293650", "128421880", "86107299", "133528102", "9985555", "153605024", "90475982", "83532976", "10088735", "85651981", "34797591", "13706605", "2357415", "129382994", "37499919", "129803791", "140189998", "128426802", "129807999", "35590784", "134038211", "129181150", "131571839", "215694732", "129433108", "1150028", "17974013", "1694099", "117643475", "84657404", "55641950", "45833123", "18962201", "9765130", "205657085"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195698846"}

From an unsupervised perspective, projection can also be obtained based on maximum independence among features (or attributes) in data to indirectly achieve better classification accuracy over more intrinsic representation of the data. Orthogonality interrelates the two sets of projections such that minimum redundancy exists between the projections, leading to more effective dimensionality reduction.

The structure of GPMs is a uniquely good match for biological problems that range from aligning sequences to modeling the genome-to-phenome relationship. The fundamental questions that GPMs address involve making decisions based on a complex web of interacting factors. Unfortunately, while GPMs ideally fit many questions in biology, they are not an easy solution to apply. Building a GPM is not a simple task for an end user. Moreover, applying GPMs is also impeded by the insidious fact that the complex web of interacting factors inherent to a problem might be easy to define and also intractable to compute upon. Discussion: We propose that the visualization sciences can contribute to many domains of the bio-sciences, by developing tools to address archetypal representation and user interaction issues in GPMs, and in particular a variety of GPM called a Conditional Random Field(CRF). CRFs bring additional power, and additional complexity, because the CRF dependency network can be conditioned on the query data. Conclusions: In this manuscript we examine the shared features of several biological problems that are amenable to modeling with CRFs, highlight the challenges that existing visualization and visual analytics paradigms induce for these data, and document an experimental solution called StickWRLD which, while leaving room for improvement, has been successfully applied in several biological research projects.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": "1407.2110", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4227292", "pubmed_id": "25000815", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-15-202", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2949065444,2037900507", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["16844581", "8970074", "125916605", "277918", "15933827", "2001151", "59314591", "16370188", "9848560", "6939203", "104834", "9149930", "16608784", "2373467", "24720049", "37973224", "2394264", "57528196", "5506455"], "inbound_citations": ["5506455", "18334040", "215688687", "14991358"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5506455"}

Traditional feature extraction methods for EEG signals always suffer from high dimension and unsatisfactory interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel symbolic representation approach of EEG signals for emotion recognition. By applying the Symbolic Aggregate approXimation(SAX) algorithm, the continuous EEG signals are represented as discrete symbol strings. The bag of words model and Latent Semantic Indexing algorithm are then performed to extract and select the word features from the symbolic strings as the discriminative features in a Support Vector Machine based classifier for emotion classification. The evaluations on DEAP dataset show that our proposed approach outperforms the three typical methods stably.

ARIARDA simultaneously pursued two avenues of research. On the one hand, available test instruments were considered and evaluated for their potential to discriminate among aviators. On the other hand, groups of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) developed criticality-rated aviator candidate abilities and traits for specific operational helicopters. Extensive literature reviews and liaison with sister services and other agencies were accomplished. Four test instruments were evaluated for use. The underlying abilities, traits, and skills these batteries purported to measure matched the abilities, traits, and skills identified as necessary by the SMEs for each of their helicopters.

In the present study, turbulent wind speed is measured by turbulence standard deviation. Although turbulent wind speed itself is unpredictable, the correlation analysis proves that the turbulence standard deviation is predictable within a proper time horizon. As a result, the turbulent wind speed can be understood ahead of time by predicting turbulence standard deviation.

The second one is the visual content loss function, which minimizes the similarity between the generated images and real images in terms of high-level visual contents. In experiments, we validate our method on two standard benchmark datasets. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of the two loss functions.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-00767-6_16", "venue": "PCM", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2891099831", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["207895028"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52305040"}

Instead of treating the input as a static signal, the image is scanned over time and converted into a time-varying signal. The temporalized image is processed by a spatiotemporal connectionist network suitable for dealing with time-varying signals. The resulting system offers several attractive features, including shift-invariance and inherent retention of local spatial relationships along the temporalized axis, a reduction in the number of free parameters, and the ability to process images of arbitrary length. Connectionist networks were chosen as they offer learnability, rapid recognition, and attractive commercial possibilities. A modular and structured approach was taken in order to simplify network construction, optimization and analysis. Results on the task of handprinted digit recognition are among the best report to date on a set of real-world ZIP code digit images, provided by the United States Postal Service. The system achieved a 99.1% recognition rate on the training set and a 96.0% recognition rate on the test set with no rejections.

Instead of building hundreds of local engine models for every engine operating point, only one ELM model is necessary for the whole process. This ELM model is firstly constructed for a starting operating point, and calibration of this starting point is conducted by determining the optimal parameters of the model. This ELM model is then re-used as a base model for a nearby target operating point, and optimization is performed on the model to search for its best parameters. With a design of experiment strategy on the best parameters obtained, new measurements from the target operating point can be collected and used to update the model. By repeating the optimization and model update procedures, the optimal parameters for the target point can be found after several iterations. By using the model of this target point as the base model for another nearby operating point and repeating the same process again, calibration for all the operating points can be done online efficiently. The contribution of the proposed method is to save the number of experiments in the calibration process. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, experiments on a commercial engine simulation software have been conducted.

In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised sparse feature learning approach, called Evolutionary Multiobjective-based ELM (EMO-ELM), and apply it to HSI feature extraction. Specifically, we represent the task of constructing the ELM Autoencoder (ELM-AE) as a multiobjective optimization problem that takes the sparsity of hidden layer outputs and the reconstruction error as two conflicting objectives. Then, we adopt an Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (EMO) method to solve the two objectives, simultaneously. To find the best solution from the Pareto solution set and construct the best trade-off feature extractor, a curvature-based method is proposed to focus on the knee area of the Pareto solutions. Benefited from the EMO, the proposed EMO-ELM is less prone to fall into a local minimum and has fewer trainable parameters than gradient-based AEs.

A precipitation separation approach using support vector machine method was developed and tested on a C-band polarimetric radar located in Taiwan (RCMK).

Through a support vector machine method, the inputs of radar reflectivity, differential reflectivity, and the separation index are utilized in the classification. The feature vector and weight vector in the support vector machine were optimized using well-classified training data. The proposed approach was tested with multiple precipitation events including two widespread mixture of stratiform and convective events, a tropical typhoon precipitation event, and a stratiform precipitation event. In the evaluation, the results from the multi-radar-multi-sensor (MRMS) precipitation classification approach were used as the ground truth, and the performances from proposed approach were further compared with the approach using separation index only with different thresholds.

Current imbalanced learning methods often handle this problem by adapting certain intermediate parameters so as to impose a bias on the minority data. However, most of these methods are in rigorous and need to adapt those factors via the trial-and-error procedure. Recently, a new model called Biased Minimax Probability Machine (BMPM) presents a rigorous and systematic work and has demonstrated very promising performance on imbalance learning. Despite its success, BMPM exclusively relies on global information, namely, the first order and second order data information; such information might be however unreliable, especially for the minority data. In this paper, we propose a new model called One-Side Probability Machine (OSPM). Different from the previous approaches, OSPM can lead to rigorous treatment on biased classification tasks. Importantly, the proposed OSPM exploits the reliable global information from one side only, i.e., the majority class, while engaging the robust local learning from the other side, i.e., the minority class. To our best knowledge, OSPM presents the first model capable of learning data both locally and globally. Our proposed model has also established close connections with various famous models such as BMPM, Support Vector Machine, and Maxi-Min Margin Machine. One appealing feature is that the optimization problem involved in the novel OSPM model can be cast as a convex second order conic programming problem with the global optimum guaranteed.

Maintaining a tip gap allows the relative motion of the blade, however a leakage flow almost always exists due to the strong pressure differentials existing near the tip airfoil boundaries. Tip leakage flow which is a 3-dimensional and highly complex flow system is responsible from a considerable amount of total pressure loss in a turbine stage. Besides, tip leakage flows induce adverse thermal effects near the blade tip, eventually causing an increase in cooling demand. Various passive control methods exist to weaken the adverse effects of tip leakage flows, in an effort to increase turbine stage efficiency. In this paper, a novel tip carving approach is applied to mitigate the undesired aerothermal effects of the tip leakage flow. A numerical investigation is carried out to obtain the optimum shape of the carved blade tip with an objective function to minimize both heat transfer and leakage loss. A genetic algorithm is used for the optimization, integrated with a meta model which predicts the objective functions quickly. Various meta-models such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are tested for this purpose. An initial database consisting of 55 blade tip geometries is created for meta-model training using \u201cSobol design of experiments\u201d methodology. This database is then successively enlarged using a coarse-to-fine approach in order to improve the prediction capabilities of the meta-models. Once a sufficient level of prediction error and a proper consistency is achieved, the optimization process is terminated. Current results indicate that carved blade tip designs are likely to achieve a considerable improvement in aero-thermal performance of axial turbine stages. Multi-objective optimization of the blade tip surface of the carved type is a promising approach in gas turbines since it paves the way for undiscovered blade tip designs for further performance improvements.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2019.07.069", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2965960296", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": ["52885582", "123063312", "122683730", "120147977", "123239520", "121388392", "97211540", "120534270", "123521284", "120593810", "120275744", "121095585", "125863553", "53590343", "112557725", "118034865", "53345104", "109553280", "116603772", "113831187", "122396596", "121758387", "114119422", "139492119", "125894703", "125894703", "125245301", "107212792", "60896462", "961425", "116858"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201273068"}

This proliferation of new Web knowledge sources is resulting in a growing need for integration and enrichment of these sources. Automated and semi-automated solutions to aligning ontologies are emerging that address this growing need with very promising results. However, nearly all approaches have focused on aligning ontologies-using relationships of similarity and equivalence and none have applied knowledge in upper ontologies. None to our knowledge have applied Support Vector Machine (SVM) technology. Only very recently, solutions for scalability of ontology alignment have begun to emerge. ::: The goal of this research is to advance the state of the art in automated ontology alignment by contributing in three main areas. First, we present new algorithms to extend the information can be derived in ontology alignment; specifically, new relationships between ontological components beyond similarity and equivalence. In particular, we present algorithms to align ontologies using subclass, superclass and relations contained within the original ontologies. We show how ontology alignment can be modeled in a Support Vector Machine and that use of SVMs enhances the ontology alignment process. Second, we contribute new evidence for ontology alignment. We show that the use of semantics in conjunction with upper ontologies and other linguistic resources can enhance the alignment process and specifically contribute to the discovery of new relationships cross-ontology. Finally, we investigate scalability issues in the area of processing, reasoning, and aligning large-scale ontologies.

The triplet loss used in the FaceNet has proved its effectiveness for face verification. However, the number of the possible triplets is explosive when using a large scale dataset to train the model. In this paper, we propose a simple class-wise triplet loss based on the intra/inter-class distance metric learning which can largely reduce the number of the possible triplets to be learned. However the simplification of the classic triplet loss function has not degraded the performance of the proposed approach. The experimental evaluations on the most widely used benchmarks LFW and YTF show that the model with the proposed class-wise simple triplet loss can reach the state-of-the-art performance. And the visualization of the distribution of the learned features based on the MNIST dataset has also shown the effectiveness of the proposed method to better separate the classes and make the features more discriminative in comparison with the other state-of-the-art loss function.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICCVW.2017.194", "venue": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCVW)", "journal": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCVW)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2768202427", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["31281854", "5785086", "3332134", "10050369", "5575601", "2908606", "206594692", "6447277", "195908774", "41312633", "16636683", "459456", "290159", "206592766", "12353933", "14124313", "17185128", "1395439", "206592295", "10611748", "1023605", "206592484", "206593880", "2814088", "4711865", "9898157", "17188384", "3960646", "10585115"], "inbound_citations": ["209386365", "195775003", "53246179", "67856565", "211206565", "86637444", "54439199", "53224900", "202785943", "174820275", "53383208", "197620300", "51930686", "152282870"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:34038047"}

In the present paper, we first extend fuzzy logic programs in a direction that brings them closer to the connectionist approach: we introduce weighted fuzzy programs, which allow the association of significance weights with the atoms that make up the body of a logic rule. The weights add expressiveness to the programs and allow the determination of the degree with which an antecedent affects the value of the rule consequent.

Although the Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) can avoid the repetitive training of old samples, invalid samples are still used, which goes against improving the accuracy of an OS-ELM model. The Online Sequence Extreme Learning Machine with Forgetting Mechanism (FOS-ELM) timely discards invalid samples, but it does not consider the differences among valid samples and then has the limitation on boosting the accuracy and generalization. To solve this issue, the Memory Degradation Based OS-ELM (MDOS-ELM) is proposed in this paper. The MDOS-ELM adjusts the weights of the old and new samples in real time by a self-adaptive memory factor, and simultaneously discards invalid samples. The self-adaptive memory factor is determined by two elements. One is the similarity between the new and old samples, and the other is the prediction errors of the current training samples on the previous model. The performance of the proposed MDOS-ELM is validated on both regression and classification datasets which include an artificial dataset and twenty-two real-world dataset. The results demonstrate that the MDOS-ELM model outperforms the OS-ELM and the FOS-ELM models on the accuracy and generalization.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2017.11.030", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2768357523", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["59603744"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3448568"}

Given the relative geographic and phylogenetic isolation of the South American continent throughout much of the Cenozoic, the South American fossil record presents a unique perspective of mammalian community evolution in the context of changing climates and environments. Here we focus on one line of evidence for paleoenvironment reconstruction: ecological diversity, i.e. the number and types of ecological niches filled within a given fauna. We propose a novel approach by utilizing ecological indices as predictors in two regressive modeling techniques\u2014Random Forest (RF) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)\u2014which are applied to 85 extant Central and South American localities to produce paleoecological prediction models. Faunal richness is quantified via ratios of ecologies within the mammalian communities, i.e. ecological indices, which serve as predictor variables in our models. Six climate/habitat variables were then predicted using these ecological indices: mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP), temperature seasonality, precipitation seasonality, canopy height, and net primary productivity (NPP). Predictive accuracy of RF and GPR is markedly higher when compared to previously published methods. MAT, MAP, and temperature seasonality have the lowest predictive error. We use these models to reconstruct paleoclimatic variables in two well-sampled Miocene faunas from South America: fossiliferous layers (FL) 1\u20137, Santa Cruz Formation (Early Miocene), Santa Cruz Province, Argentina; and the Monkey Beds unit, Villavieja Formation (Middle Miocene) Huila, Colombia. Results suggest general concordance with published estimations of precipitation and temperature, and add information with regards to the other climate/habitat variables included here. Ultimately, we believe that RF and GPR in conjunction with ecological indices have the potential to contribute to paleoenvironment reconstruction.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.01.014", "venue": null, "journal": "Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology", "mag_id": "2910939188", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["211108420"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:133978120"}

These children often suffer poor sport performance leading to low exercise levels and the associated consequences. If the condition is not treated, the ITW children eventually develop abnormal gait pattern as adults and could suffer from postural problems. However, ITW gait is difficult to observe since children can modify their gait when made aware of it.

Although ADSs can detect novel attacks, they generate a large number of false alarms due to the difficulty in obtaining complete descriptions of normal software behavior. This paper presents a multiple-detector ADS that efficiently combines the decisions from heterogeneous detectors (e.g., STIDE, HMM, and OCSVM), using Boolean combination in the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) space, to reduce the false alarms. Results on two modern and large system call datasets generated from Linux and Windows operating systems show that the proposed ADS consistently outperforms an ADS based on a single best detector and on an ensemble of homogeneous detectors. At an operating point of zero percent alarm rate, the proposed multiple-detector ADS increased the true positive rate by 500% on the Linux dataset and by 25% on the Window dataset.

Such data is extremely voluminous and to be useful it must be processed at high velocity. Due to the complexity of big data analysis especially for dynamic applications, online forecasting of pollutant concentration trends within a reasonable processing time is still an open problem. The purpose of this paper is to present an online forecasting approach based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict the air quality one day in advance. In order to overcome the computational requirements for large-scale data analysis, distributed computing based on the Hadoop platform has been employed to leverage the processing power of multiple processing units. The MapReduce programming model is adopted for massive parallel processing in this study. Based on the online algorithm and Hadoop framework, an online forecasting system is designed to predict the air pollution of Tehran for the next 24 hours.

Despite these constraints, the architecture is computationally adequate for syntactic parsing. In addition, the constraints make some significant lingustic predictions.

Security administrators need to prioritise which feature to focus on amidst the various possibilities and avenues of attack, especially via Web Service in e-commerce applications. This study addresses the feature selection problem by proposing a predictive fuzzy associative rule model (FARM). FARM validates inputs by segregating the anomalies based fuzzy associative patterns discovered from five attributes in the intrusion datasets. These associative patterns leads to the discovery of a set of 18 interesting rules at 99% confidence and subsequently, categorisation into not only certainly allow/deny but also probably deny access decision class. FARM's classification provides 99% classification accuracy and less than 1% false alarm rate. Our findings indicate two benefits to using fuzzy datasets. First, fuzzy enables the discovery of fuzzy association patterns, fuzzy association rules and more sensitive classification. In addition, the root mean squared error (RMSE) and classification accuracy for fuzzy and crisp datasets do not differ much when using the Random Forest classifier. However, when other classifiers are used with increasing number of instances on the fuzzy and crisp datasets, the fuzzy datasets perform much better.

The datasets are Pima Indians diabetes and Cleveland coronary illness and consist of 768 records. Though there are a number of solutions available for information extraction from a huge datasets and to predict the possibility of having diabetes, but the accuracy of their mining process is far from accurate. For achieving highest accuracy, the issue of zero probability which is generally faced by naive bayes analysis needs to be addressed suitably. The proposed framework RB-Bayes aims to extract the required information with high accuracy that could survive the problem of zero probability and also configure accuracy with other methods like Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, and K Nearest Neighbor. We calculated mean to handle missing data and calculated probability for yes (positive) and no (negative). The highest value between yes and no decide the value for the tuple.

Nevertheless, in developed countries, CTG is still the most widely employed prenatal technique for monitoring fetal health; and in many countries it represents a medical report with legal value. To overcome the drawbacks of the visual interpretation, many computerized systems for automatic or semi-automatic analysis of CTG have been developed in the last years. Recently, in order to support the diagnosis process, and to increase the predictive capability of these systems, also other techniques such as artificial neural network, deep learning and machine learning have been introduced. In previous works of the authors, software for automatic CTG analysis has been developed and described in detail. Now, by employing a dataset of features extracted from CTG signals with that software, to enhance its performances, different algorithms, such as J48, Adaboosting, Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Tree, have been tested to predict whether a birth would be a caesarean section or a vaginal delivery. The RF algorithm showed the best performance, since it reached the highest accuracy (87.6%), precision (87.9%) and AUCROC (93.0%).

In this paper, we propose a novel SPD matrix metric learning method of discovering SPD matrix intrinsic properties and measuring the distance considering different roles of intrinsic properties. In particular, the intrinsic properties of an SPD matrix are discovered by projecting the SPD matrix to multiple low-dimensional SPD manifolds, and the obtained low-dimensional SPD matrices constitute a set. Accordingly, the metric between two original SPD matrices is transformed into a set-to-set metric on multiple low-dimensional SPD manifolds. Based on the learnable alpha-beta divergence, the set-to-set metric is computed by summarizing multiple alpha-beta divergences assigned on low-dimensional SPD manifolds, which models different roles of intrinsic properties.

As the number of online social computing systems that collect user data grows, this privacy threat is further exacerbated. There has been some work (both, recent and older) on addressing these privacy concerns. These approaches typically require extra computational resources, which might be beneficial where privacy is concerned, but when dealing with Green Computing and sustainability, this is not a great option. Spending more computation time results in spending more energy and more resources that make the software system less sustainable. Ideally, what we would like are techniques for designing software systems that address these privacy concerns but which are also sustainable systems where privacy could be achieved \u201cfor free,\u201d i.e., without having to spend extra computational effort. In this paper, we describe how privacy can be achieved for free an accidental and beneficial side effect of doing some existing computation and what types of privacy threats it can mitigate.

Additive WGN in the DTMF input samples is removed by filtering out unwanted frequencies. Detection of DTMF carrier frequencies from input samples employs a traditional software based approach using the power spectrum analysis of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) signals. The Goertzel's Algorithm is used to estimate the seven fundamental DTMF carrier frequencies. A SVM classifier is trained using the estimated fundamental DTMF carrier frequencies, and is validated using the input samples for classification of low and high DTMF frequency groups. The tone detection scheme employs decision logic using a rule-base expert system for classification of low and high DTMF frequency groups, corresponding to valid DTMF frequency groups.

We first introduce an efficient way to compute a time surface that is invariant to the speed of the objects. We then show that we can train a Random Forest to recognize events generated by a moving corner from our time surface. Random Forests are also extremely efficient, and therefore a good choice to deal with the high capture frequency of event-based cameras ---our implementation processes up to 1.6Mev/s on a single CPU. Thanks to our time surface formulation and this learning approach, our method is significantly more robust to abrupt changes of direction of the corners compared to previous ones. Our method also naturally assigns a confidence score for the corners, which can be useful for postprocessing.

Structure\u2013activity relationships (SAR) can be efficiently used to predict the carcinogenic hazard of new chemicals, before producing them on a large scale or even before synthesizing them. SAR models that detect potential carcinogens can also supplement short\u2013term tests of genotoxicity, long\u2013term tests of carcinogenicity in rodents, or epidemiological evidence in humans. Method. Support vector machine (SVM) is an efficient classification algorithm that can provide highly predictive SAR models for the carcinogenic hazard. We have applied the SVM model to identify the carcinogenic activity of 46 methylated and 32 non\u2013methylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). The PAH chemical structure was encoded by four theoretical descriptors computed with PM3, namely the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital EHOMO, the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ELUMO, the hardness HD, and the difference between EHOMO and EHOMO\u20131. Results. A wide range of SVM experiments were performed using the dot, polynomial, radial basis function, neural, and anova kernels. The results obtained for the classification of PAH carcinogenicity demonstrate that the performances of SVM depend strongly on the kernel type and various parameters that control the kernel shape. The best prediction results were obtained with the radial basis function kernel with J = 0.5, the anova kernel with J = 0.5 and d = 1, and the anova kernel with J = 0.5 and d = 2. In the first case, from 34 carcinogenic compounds, 28 were correctly classified, while from 44 non\u2013carcinogenic compounds, 40 were correctly classified. Conclusions. SAR models for predicting the carcinogenic hazard can benefit from the use of support vector machines, which determine a maximum separating hyperplane between carcinogenic and non\u2013carcinogenic compounds. The solution of the SVM model is a unique hyperplane which can be computed very fast, but the classification results heavily depend on the kernel type and structural descriptors.

Manifold learning is the study of methods that aim to infer geometrical structure from data sampled from manifolds, enabling nonlinear solutions to various machine learning tasks. Gene expression data analysis is the analysis of measurements of the abundance of gene products from a set of genes in the cell, which, by the use of microarray technology, can include the whole genome. Since the expression of one gene is dynamically linked to the expression of others, it is reasonable to assume that such expression data exhibits nonlinear structure, why it would be natural to approach its analysis using nonlinear methods, such as manifold learning. Within the methodological development of manifold learning this thesis presents a method for robust estimation of geodesic distances (paper I), and a method for supervised manifold learning based on kernel dimension reduction (paper II). An extension of the latter algorithm to partitioned data is also presented. Further, a method for variable importance assessment in manifold learning is proposed (paper IV). Within gene expression data analysis, results are presented that demonstrates better performance of manifold learning methods compared to linear methods in visualization of microarray samples (paper III). It is also demonstrated how genes can be ranked according to their influence on the observed structure in such nonlinear representations (paper IV). Finally, it is shown how biologically relevant gene/gene similarity measures can be obtained using unsupervised and supervised manifold learning (paper V).

Many studies have compared the prediction accuracy of different SDM modeling methods, but few have quantified the similarity among prediction maps. There has also been little systematic exploration of how the relative importance of different predictor variables varies among model types and affects map similarity. Our objective was to expand the evaluation of SDM performance for 45 plant species in southern California to better understand how map predictions vary among model types, and to explain what factors may affect spatial correspondence, including the selection and relative importance of different environmental variables. Four types of models were tested. Correlation among maps was highest between generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized additive models (GAMs) and lowest between classification trees and GAMs or GLMs. Correlation between Random Forests (RFs) and GAMs was the same as between RFs and classification trees. Spatial correspondence among maps was influenced the most by model prediction accuracy (AUC) and species prevalence; map correspondence was highest when accuracy was high and prevalence was intermediate (average prevalence for all species was 0.124). Species functional type and the selection of climate variables also influenced map correspondence. For most (but not all) species, climate variables were more important than terrain or soil in predicting their distributions. Environmental variable selection varied according to modeling method, but the largest differences were between RFs and GLMs or GAMs. Although prediction accuracy was equal for GLMs, GAMs, and RFs, the differences in spatial predictions suggest that it may be important to evaluate the results of more than one model to estimate the range of spatial uncertainty before making planning decisions based on map outputs.

To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a multi sensor system for silkworm cocoons gender classification and separation. Utilizing a load sensor and a digital camera, the system acquires weight and digital images from individual silkworm cocoons. An image processing procedure is then applied to extract significant shape-related features from each image instance, which, combined with the weight data, are provided as inputs to train a Support Vector Machine-based pattern classifier for gender classification. Subsequently, an air blower mechanism and a conveyor system sort the cocoons into their respective bins.

In many applications of image processing and computer vision, it is image segmentation that is widely used. The study of the Computed Tomography (CT) images considers image segmentation a very important and vital part in identifying the different kinds of tumor. The classification of the tumor and the non-tumor images followed by the segmentation of tumor region in CT images is done by the proposed methodology. The process of classifying is carried out by Support Vector Machine (SVM) with different kernel functions and optimization techniques. This SVM classifier with Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) is predominant over the other methodologies in the analysis of classification process. The segmentation process after the classification process is performed by the Modified Region Growing (MRG) with threshold optimization. As regards the threshold optimization, certain algorithms such as Harmony Search (HS), Evolutionary Programming (EP) and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) are made use of. It is with the aid of a wide set of performance measures that the results are demonstrated. The comparative analysis in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy is done for the optimization techniques said supra. An accuracy rate of 99.05% in the analysis of segmentation process is obtained using the GWO technique. It is in the working platform of MATLAB that this proposed methodology is implemented.

Most of researches are concerned with the incorporation of knowledge in the form of numerical relationships. Little work, however, has been done to incorporate the prior knowledge on the structural relationships among the variables (referred as to Structural Prior Knowledge, SPK). This paper explores the incorporation of SPK in SVR by constructing appropriate admissible support vector kernel (SV kernel) based on the properties of reproducing kernel (R.K). Three-levels specifications of SPK are studied with the corresponding sub-levels of prior knowledge that can be considered for the method. These include Hierarchical SPK (HSPK), Interactional SPK (ISPK) consisting of independence, global and local interaction, Functional SPK (FSPK) composed of exterior-FSPK and interior-FSPK. A convenient tool for describing the SPK, namely Description Matrix of SPK is introduced. Subsequently, a new SVR, namely Motivated Support Vector Regression (MSVR) whose structure is motivated in part by SPK, is proposed. Synthetic examples show that it is possible to incorporate a wide variety of SPK and helpful to improve the approximation performance in complex cases. The benefits of MSVR are finally shown on a real-life military application, Air-toground battle simulation, which shows great potential for MSVR to the complex military applications.

Using signals from only four channels (Fp1, Fp2, F3 and F4) we obtained, after balancing, accuracies of 98% (valence) and 99% (arousal) for subject dependent experiments with three classes, and 85% (valence) and 87% (arousal) for two-class classification. However, accuracies for subject independent experiments were lower than the ones obtained using imbalanced datasets. We obtained accuracies of 52% (valence) and of 49% (arousal) for two classes, and accuracies of 36% (valence) and of 31% (arousal) for three classes. To explain the low accuracies in subject independent experiments, we present arguments and empirical evidence using correlations between the percentage of samples for each class and the accuracies obtained by approaches which did not use balanced datasets.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICDSP.2016.7868619", "venue": "2016 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)", "journal": "2016 IEEE International Conference on Digital Signal Processing (DSP)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2594911616", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15243027"}

However, it is quite challenging since that images and language descriptions in real world are noisy with great variability. Most existing text-to-image methods aim to generate images in a holistic manner, which ignore the difference between images' foreground and background, resulting in that objects in images are easily disturbed by the background. Moreover, they commonly ignore the complementarity of different kinds of generative models. In this paper, we propose a context-aware approach to perform text-to-image generation, which separates background and foreground for generating high-quality images, as well as utilizes complementarity between Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for robust text-to-image generation. First, context-aware conditional VAE is proposed to capture images' basic layout and color based on text, which pays different attention on the background and foreground of images for effective text-image alignment. Then, conditional GAN is adopted for refining the generation of VAE, which recovers lost details and corrects the defects for realistic image generation. Attributed to such stacked VAE-GAN structure, two kinds of generative models can boost each other for more effective and stable text-to-image generation.

Appropriately handling missing data is crucial for accurate inference. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature to deal with multi-source classification problems, however they neglect the presence of missingness in the data and assume that the data are complete which is not the case in real life. Other approaches use directly simple data imputation before the learning process, which is not always enough to obtain a reliable learning and prediction model. In this paper, we propose a new approach to deal with missing data in multi-source classification problem. In our approach, we avoid the direct imputation when the concerned feature is not important, but we also adjust the predictions fusion process based on the missing data rate in each data source and in the new instance to classify.

In addition, in contrast to traditional computation models, the reservoir is a dynamical system in which computation and memory are inseparable, and therefore hard to analyze. Here, we compare echo state networks (ESN), a popular RC architecture, with tapped-delay lines (DL) and nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) networks, which we use to model systems with limited computation and limited memory respectively.

In this context, online social media has attracted the interest of data scientists seeking to understand behaviours and trends, whilst collecting statistics for social sites. One potential application for these data is personality prediction, which aims to understand a user's behaviour within social media. Traditional personality prediction relies on users' profiles, their status updates, the messages they post, etc. Here, a personality prediction system for social media data is introduced that differs from most approaches in the literature, in that it works with groups of texts, instead of single texts, and does not take users' profiles into account. Also, the proposed approach extracts meta-attributes from texts and does not work directly with the content of the messages. The set of possible personality traits is taken from the Big Five model and allows the problem to be characterised as a multi-label classification task. The problem is then transformed into a set of five binary classification problems and solved by means of a semi-supervised learning approach, due to the difficulty in annotating the massive amounts of data generated in social media. In our implementation, the proposed system was trained with three well-known machine-learning algorithms, namely a Naive Bayes classifier, a Support Vector Machine, and a Multilayer Perceptron neural network. The system was applied to predict the personality of Tweets taken from three datasets available in the literature, and resulted in an approximately 83% accurate prediction, with some of the personality traits presenting better individual classification rates than others.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "24969690", "doi": "10.1016/j.neunet.2014.05.020", "venue": "Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society", "journal": "Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society", "mag_id": "1974073092", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["7905100", "198338281", "17184185", "46351623", "199540971", "51924606", "208301710", "3065281", "15434813", "201072134", "32644681", "208880019", "43870346", "3432607", "212742026", "4995694", "57764415", "1702189", "49726575", "8451205", "149659458", "25328931"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:20263528"}

Functional Networks-Support Vector Machines (FN-SVM) and Functional Networks-Type-2 Fuzzy Logic (FN-T2FL) were proposed to improve the performance of the stand-alone SVM and T2FL models respectively. The FN component of the FN-T2FL hybrid model automatically extracts the most relevant attributes from the input data us ing the least square fitting algorithm as an improvement over the individual Functional Networks and Type-2 Fuzzy Logic models. The former is more promising as it combines two existing techniques that are very close in performance and well known for their computational stability and fast processing. The FN- SVM hybrid model also benefits from the excellent perfo rmance of the least-square-based model-selection algorithm of Functional Networks and the non-linear high-dimensional feature transformation capability that is based on structur al risk minimization and Tikhonov regularization properties of SVM. Training and testing the SVM component of the hybrid model with the best and dimensionally-reduced variables f rom the input data resulted in better performance with higher correlation coefficients, lower root mean square er rors and less execution time than the traditional SVM model.

We propose an end-to-end framework that uses a combination of deep convolution and recurrent neural networks to extract high-level features from raw flow signal with a structured output layer based on a conditional random field to model the temporal transition structure of the sleep stages. We improve upon the previous methods by 10% using our model, that can be augmented to the previous sleep staging deep learning methods. We also show that our method can be used to accurately track sleep metrics like sleep efficiency calculated from sleep stages that can be deployed for monitoring the response of CPAP therapy on sleep apnea patients. Apart from the technical contributions, we expect this study to motivate new research questions in sleep science.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1807.09119", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/BigData.2018.8622286", "venue": "2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "journal": "2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2949831464,2898504028", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["12872820", "33058994", "13694816", "36527527", "6237367", "20026435", "11607380", "215570072", "142587162", "8137251", "375959", "86579681", "4787295", "23130826", "11299351", "206761818", "20173460", "206594692", "23140727", "30978186", "6058937", "546959", "22941555", "3978691", "8946965", "6084014", "15539264", "6844431", "6447277", "1915014", "9668607", "5201925", "277918", "2794372", "14936825", "3983993", "8466284", "144565557", "8485068", "6287870", "10529789", "1450294", "7445572", "16351829"], "inbound_citations": ["204971616", "204246935", "203625986"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53097078"}

Detecting such attacks has attracted several contributions in the past few years. Nonetheless, the applicability of the current detection mechanisms in the deployed vehicular networks is hindered by two main challenges imposed by the special characteristics of VANETs. The first challenge is related to the highly mobile nature of vehicles that complicates the processes of monitoring, buffering, and analyzing observations on these vehicles as they are continuously moving and changing their locations. The second challenge is concerned with the limited resources of the vehicles especially in terms of storage space that restricts the vehicles\u2019 capacity of storing a huge amount of observations and applying complex detection mechanisms. To tackle these challenges, we propose a multi-decision intelligent detection model called CEAP that complies with the highly mobile nature of VANET with increased detection rate and minimal overhead. The basic idea is to launch cooperative monitoring between vehicles to build a training dataset that is analyzed by the Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning technique in online and incremental fashions to classify the smart vehicles either cooperative or malicious. To adapt the proposed model to the high mobility, we design it on top of the VANET QoS-OLSR protocol, which is a clustering protocol that maintains the stability of the clusters and prolongs the network\u2019s lifetime by considering the mobility metrics of vehicles during clusters formation. To reduce the overhead of the proposed detection model and make it feasible for the resource-constrained nodes, we reduce the size of the training dataset by (1) restricting the data collection, storage, and analysis to concern only a set of specialized nodes (i.e., Multi-Point Relays) that are responsible for forwarding packets on behalf of their clusters; and (2) migrating only few tuples (i.e., support vectors) from one detection iteration to another. We propose as well a propagation algorithm that disseminates only the final decisions (instead of the whole dataset) among clusters with the aim of reducing the overhead of either exchanging results between each set of vehicles or repeating the detection steps for the already detected malicious vehicles. Simulation results show that our model is able to increase the accuracy of detections, enhance the attack detection rate, decrease the false positive rate, and improve the packet delivery ratio in the presence of high mobility compared to the classical SVM-based, Dempster\u2013Shafer-based, and averaging-based detection techniques.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2015.12.006", "venue": "Expert Syst.

This includes both industrial-scale and smallholder plantations, the management of which entails specific challenges, with either operational scale having its own particular social and environmental challenges. Although, past studies addressed the mapping of oil palm with remote sensing data, none of these studies considered the discrimination between industrial and smallholder plantations and, furthermore, between young and mature oil palm stands. This study assesses the feasibility of mapping oil palm plantations, by typology (industrial versus smallholder) and age (young versus mature), in the largest palm oil producing region of Indonesia (Riau province). The impact of using optical images (Sentinel-2) and radar scenes (Sentinel-1) in a Random Forest classification model was investigated. The classification model was implemented in a cloud computing system to map the oil palm plantations of Riau province. Our results show that the mapping of oil palm plantations by typology and age requires a set of optimal features, derived from optical and radar data, to obtain the best model performance (OA = 90.2% and kappa = 87.2%). These features are texture images that capture contextual information, such as the dense harvesting trail network in industrial plantations. The study also shows that the mapping of mature oil palm trees, without distinction between smallholder and industrial plantations, can be done with high accuracy using only Sentinel-1 data (OA = 93.5% and kappa = 86.9%) because of the characteristic backscatter response of palm-like trees in radar scenes. This means that researchers, certification bodies, and stakeholders can adequately detect mature oil palm stands over large regions without training complex classification models and with Sentinel-1 features as the only predictive variables. The results over Riau province show that smallholders represent 49.9% of total oil palm plantations, which is higher than reported in previous studies. This study is an important step towards a global map of oil palm plantations at different production scales and stand ages that can frequently be updated. Resulting insights would facilitate a more informed debate about optimizing land use for meeting global vegetable oil demands from oil palm and other oil crops.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/rs11212590", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": "Remote Sensing", "mag_id": "2984223285", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208224953"}

Based on the focal training sample, the model was calibrated using the cross-validation method, and the optimal bandwidth was determined. The results were compared with those of a nonlinear global SVM (GSVM) model that was calibrated based on the ten-fold cross-validation method. This study then evaluated an integrated SVM model (LGSVM) obtained based on a weighted combination of the local and global urban development probabilities. A comparison of the probability maps showed a higher accuracy for the LGSVM than for either the LSVM or GSVM model. To assess the performance of the LSVM, GSVM and LGSVM models in the simulation of urban growth, probability maps were employed as the transition rules for urban cellular automata.

Assessment of the species identity was performed using four nuclear DNA markers, and previously published single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. A general pattern of cline variation was observed with increasing Mytilus trossulus share towards the eastern Baltic Sea. Average allele share rose to 61% in Hoga Kusten, Gulf of Bothnia. All Baltic Sea samples revealed a strong introgression of Mytilus edulis and a limited introgression of M. trossulus through the Danish Straits. The studied environmental variables described 67 and 68% of the variability in the allele frequencies of M. edulis and M. trossulus. Salinity defined over 50% of the variability in the gene frequencies of the studied Mytilus spp. populations. Changes along this environmental gradient were not gradual but instead a significant shift from gene dominance was found at a salinity of 12 PSU.

This paper generalizes the RF framework to other multiclass classification algorithms like the well-established MultiNomial Logit (MNL) and Naive Bayes (NB). We propose Random MNL (RMNL) as a new bagged classifier combining a forest of MNLs estimated with randomly selected features. Analogously, we introduce Random Naive Bayes (RNB).

Bacteriophage genomes are an example that cannot be easily analyzed by these methods. This work addresses these shortcomings and aims to provide an automated prediction system of gene function.ResultsWe have developed a novel system called SynFPS to perform gene function prediction over completed genomes. The prediction system is initialized by clustering a large collection of weakly related genomes into groups based on their resemblance in gene distribution. From each individual group, data are then extracted and used to train a Support Vector Machine that makes gene function predictions. Experiments were conducted with 9 different gene functions over 296 bacteriophage genomes. Cross validation results gave an average prediction accuracy of ~80%, which is comparable to other genomic-context based prediction methods. Functional predictions are also made on 3 uncharacterized genes and 12 genes that cannot be identified by sequence alignment. The software is publicly available at http://www.synteny.net/.ConclusionThe proposed system employs genomic context to predict gene function and detect gene correspondence in whole-genome comparisons.

For insects in particular, the difficult taxonomy and the lack of experts greatly hampers studies on conservation and ecology. We have developed a system for the automated identification of bee species which employs image analysis to classify bee forewings. The wings of the bees show a clear venation within a transparent surrounding. Our prototypical system [6] employs a semi automatic extraction of this venation by applying a line following procedure after interactively setting remarkable points of interest. Since both image distortions as well as random genetic mutations incorporate a high amount of uncertainty, the stage of feature extraction is left to an experienced taxonomical expert. However, due to the worldwide lack of experts in bee species we are confronted with the task of substituting the experts knowledge by a completely automated feature extraction. The remaining uncertainty in the location of some critical points then has to be dealt with additional features compensating the lack of information.

Major habitat types, such as lowland tropical evergreen forests or mangrove forests, are already well represented in many conservation priorities, while others are underrepresented. This is particularly true for dry deciduous dipterocarp forests (DDF), a key forest type in Asia that extends from the tropical to the subtropical regions in South-east Asia (SE Asia), where high temperatures and pronounced seasonal precipitation patterns are predominant. DDF are a unique forest ecosystem type harboring a wide range of important and endemic species and need to be adequately represented in global biodiversity conservation strategies. One of the greatest challenges in DDF conservation is the lack of detailed and accurate maps of their distribution due to inaccurate open-canopy seasonal forest mapping methods. Conventional land cover maps therefore tend to perform inadequately with DDF. Our study accurately delineates DDF on a continental scale based on remote sensing approaches by integrating the strong, characteristic seasonality of DDF. We also determine the current conservation status of DDF throughout SE Asia. We chose SE Asia for our research because its remaining DDF are extensive in some areas but are currently degrading and under increasing pressure from significant socio-economic changes throughout the region. Phenological indices, derived from MODIS vegetation index time series, served as input variables for a Random Forest classifier and were used to predict the spatial distribution of DDF. The resulting continuous fields maps of DDF had accuracies ranging from R\u00b2 = 0.56 to 0.78.

This could then be used to determine what kinds of techniques are suitable for what class of separability (linear, multi-linear or non-linear). This representation can then be used in intrusion detection, biological sequences, pattern recognition/classification and numerous other applications. INTRODUCTION Various approaches have been proposed to detect intrusions based upon detecting deviations from normal host based traffic. Host based systems attempt to detect anomalies based upon system call information, an idea first suggested by Forrest et al [8]. Sequences of system calls are used to determine if an intrusion has taken place or not. This sequence of system calls is nothing but a sequence of finite length strings. This study is an attempt to define an abstract representation for the strings representing the various system calls of a host based anomaly detection system. Such a representation can also be used in other areas where such sequences of strings come into the picture, examples being the study of DNA sequences and pattern recognition. The motivation for such a representation is to use it to study and understand the theory behind different classes of patterns and the underlying separability issues easily. With such a canonical representation, we would be able to determine what kinds of techniques are suitable for what class of separability linear, multi-linear or non-linear. The simplest case of a linearly separable decision problem is one consisting of two sets of points (patterns) in a 2-D vector space that belong to different classes, where the two classes can be separated by a straight line. In 3 dimensions the equivalent problem is one where the points are separable by a plane. We can extend this idea to any number of dimensions, though 4 or 5 dimensions are harder to visualize. Planes and straight lines are just hyperplanes of dimension 1 and 2. There are hyperplanes of higher dimension. In higher dimensional cases two classes in an N dimensional space are termed as linearly separable if they are separable by a hyperplane of dimension N-1. The strings in our representation scheme could represent the various system calls of a host based anomaly (intrusion) detection system. Such a representation can also be used in other areas where such sequences of strings come into the picture, examples being the study of DNA sequences and pattern recognition. RELATED WORK There is no work in this particular area available to our knowledge that we can cite here. But there are some works that we studied which could assist us in our representation scheme. These works are described next. Linear Separability of Sets Two sets X1 and X2 in Euclidean space E , which means each element x in those sets is represented as an ntuple: x = ( E1, E2, ..., En ) . The hyperplane which seperates the two sets is represented as a nonzero vector in E. This is the normal to the separating plane: a = ( p1, p2, ..., pn, p ) . The following algorithm [2] is a recursive solution to find the vector a, the normal to the hyperplane separating the two sets X1 and X2. It is defined as the function a = A( s, P ) taking two parameters: 1. s, the number of elements in the subset Ys of Y: Ys = { y1, y2, ..., ys } 2. P, a subspace of Euclidean space E of dimension k+1. The algorithm also assumes that the two sets X1 and X2 are not existing in the same hyperplane; if this is the case, then Y = X1 X2 contains a basis of E . The algorithm (from [6]) is as follows: 1. Find a subset B of Y which, when unioned with P , demonstrates linear closure under E: B = { yr0, yr1, ..., yrk } and B1 = { yr1, yr2, ..., yrk } 2. Find a vector x such that: x exists in P B1 and x \u00b7 yr0 > 0 3. If k = 0, then x defined by step 2 is returned as the solution a Otherwise, we define the sequence a0 = x, a1, a2, ..., as = a 4. Set a0 := x 5. Iterate from i = 1...s the recursive step of the algorithm: if ai-1 \u00b7 Yi 0, then ai := ai-1 else ai := A( i-1, P { yi } ) The algorithm will terminate in step 3, returning the vector a as the normal of the hyperplane separating X1 and X2. Threshold Logic Unit In a Threshold Logic Unit (TLU) [9], the output of the unit in response to a particular input pattern is calculated in two stages. First the activation is determined. The activation is passed through a threshold function to obtain the output. Learning in a TLU is concerned with using an automatic procedure for adjusting the weights and threshold so that the decision boundary minimizes the error function. A simple learning procedure for a TLU is called the perceptron learning rule. The error function used for the perceptron training rule is based on the number of incorrectly classified points in the training set. The perceptron learning procedure minimizes this error function. The Least Mean Squares rule minimizes an error measure called the mean squared error. In the TLU implementation of this rule the error for each pattern is calculated by finding the difference between the desired and actual activation, i.e. the error is calculated using the activation of the TLU before it is passed through the threshold function and weights are updated. If the weights are updated after every input pattern then the decision boundary will continue to move around the point with the lowest error. Support Vector Machines Support vector machine [4] finds a nonlinear decision function in the input space by mapping the data into a higher dimensional feature space and separating it there by means of a maximum margin hyperplane. The computational complexity of the classification operation does not depend on the dimensionality of the feature space, which can even be infinite. Overfitting is avoided by controlling the margin. The separating hyperplane is represented sparsely as a linear combination of points. The system automatically identifies a subset of informative points and uses them to represent the solution. Finally, the training algorithm solves a simple convex optimization problem. All these features make Support Vector Machines an attractive classification system. Convex Hull Methods Another strategy used to separate a set of points from another set of points on a plane is to compute the convex hull of the two sets of points [5]. If the convex hulls overlap, then the given sets are not separable. Quite a few strategies are known for convex hull. These include Graham\u2019s scan [7], Jarvis\u2019 March [1] and Quick Hull [3]. Convex hulls in two and even three dimensions are fairly easy to work with. However, as the dimension of a space increases, certain assumptions that were valid in lower dimensions break down. For example, any n-vertex polygon in two dimensions has exactly n edges. However, the relationship between the numbers of faces and vertices is more complicated even in three dimensions. OUR EXERCISE The idea is to create a lattice based structure which can be used to create an abstract representation so that we can differentiate between \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201cabnormal\u201d sequences of system calls, that is, two different sets of strings. The system calls are finite in number. Let the various system calls be represented by a unique natural number, which is 1, 2, 3, and so on. Our goal is to define an abstract representation of these system calls (which are inherently strings). We would like to start with a simple model consisting of 3 system calls and then build upon the same, adding more complexity and venturing into higher dimensions, as we will explain later. Let system call s1 be represented by 1, system call s2 be represented by 2, and system call s3 be represented by 3. There are a total of 3! = 6 combinations corresponding to these 3 numbers (representing strings/system calls), namely 1 2 3, 1 3 2, 2 1 3, 3 1 2, 3 2 1 and 2 3 1.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2292302586", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["11489410", "9793096", "208104201", "206556577"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204238"}

In addition, given the combinatorial nature of the overall problem, stochastic search strategies are suggested to escape from local minima which are not globally optimal.Finally, we report experiments on a number of datasets. The performance obtained using few simple linear prototypes is comparable to that obtained by state-of-the-art kernel-based methods but with a significant reduction (of one or two orders) in response time.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "Journal of Machine Learning Research", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2101577816", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["12544414", "9790719", "5934464", "47109072", "12619079", "2908949", "35292337", "44944785", "1536643", "61074380", "15773445", "60375743", "1204938", "14669541", "6636078", "8692705", "7596571", "28637672"], "inbound_citations": ["17658381", "1947808", "2798271", "5250083", "15021882", "3533689", "17278887", "5450130", "950252", "499581", "19853663", "31926726", "834469", "46895026", "17192857", "996932", "53621415", "110115037", "31940189", "11253517", "24089992", "7566283", "18070556", "33578972", "56140940", "152147", "16598215", "16409368", "54442294", "1936337", "27051716", "7675828", "541070", "3640287"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7499012"}

Each species was modeled individually to show current and potential future habitats according to two emission scenarios (high emissions on current trajectory and reasonable conservation of energy implemented) and three climate models: the Parallel Climate Model, the Hadley CM3 model, and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory model. Since we model potential suitable habitats of species, our results should not be interpreted as actual changes in ranges of the species. We also evaluated both emission scenarios under an \u2018\u2018average\u2019\u2019 future climate from all three models. Climate change could have large impacts on suitable habitat for tree species in the eastern United States, especially under a high emissions trajectory. Of the 134 species, approximately 66 species would gain and 54 species would lose at least 10% of their suitable habitat under climate change. A lower emission pathway would result in lower numbers of both losers and gainers. When the mean centers, i.e. center of gravity, of current and potential future habitat are evaluated, most of the species habitat moves generally northeast, up to 800 km in the hottest scenario and highest emissions trajectory. The models suggest a retreat of the spruce-fir zone and an advance of the southern oaks and pines. In any case, our results show that species will have a lot less pressure to move their suitable habitats if we follow the path of lower emissions of greenhouse gases.

Limited data is available from single beam sonars which have the ability to classify the bottom sediment after some pre-tuning. Core, grab and single beam sonar samples all suffer from the fact that only sparse sediment samples are available for bottom mapping. A new high resolution source of data has recently become available using amplitude from multibeam sonars. Multibeam sonars provide up to 4000 bottom samples in the athwart ship direction. These samples are traditionally used to map a swath of the bottom with respect to depth. A new Multibeam Bottom Sediment Classification Algorithm (MBSCA), scheduled for installation on the new Pathfinder TAGS-60 survey vessel, uses sonar amplitude to determine the bottom sediment type. The classification algorithm relies on a one-time transducer and hydrophone calibration at initial sonar installation in dB/uPa. Because amplitude is calibrated, no at sea tuning is needed. The MBSCA algorithm was developed using data collected on the Tags-34 USNS Wyman survey vessel. Surveys were conducted in areas with known core sample data.

A high-throughput immunoassay technique that quantitates the expression of relevant proteins of glycolysis, glycogenolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, oxidative phosphorylation, pyruvate and fatty acid oxidation, tricarboxylic acid cycle and the antioxidant response in two large independent and retrospectively collected cohorts of PEO-sD, PEO-mD and MELAS patients revealed that despite the heterogeneity of the genetic alterations, the three MDs showed the same metabolic signatures in both cohorts of patients, which were highly divergent from those of healthy individuals. Linear Discriminant Analysis and Support Vector Machine classifier provided a minimum of four biomarkers to discriminate healthy from pathological samples. Regardless of the induction of a large number of enzymes involved in ameliorating oxidative stress, the down-regulation of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2) and catalase expression favored the accumulation of oxidative damage in patients' proteins. Down-regulation of SOD2 and catalase expression in MD patients is not due to relevant changes in the availability of their mRNAs, suggesting that oxidative stress regulates the expression of the two enzymes post-transcriptionally.

The ::: key idea is to apply entity linking (EL) methods that identify mentions of KB entities in text, ::: and then exploit the structured information within KGs. Developing entity-centric methods for ::: text understanding using KG exploration is the focus of this work. ::: ::: We aim to show that structured background knowledge is a means for improving performance in ::: different IR and NLP tasks that traditionally only make use of the unstructured text input itself. ::: Thereby, the KB entities mentioned in text act as connection between the unstructured text and ::: the structured KG. We focus in particular on how to best leverage the knowledge as contained in ::: such fully-structured (RDF) KGs like DBpedia with their labeled edges/predicates \u2013 which is in ::: contrast to previous work on Wikipedia-based approaches we build upon, which typically relies ::: on unlabeled graphs only. The contribution of this thesis can be structured along its three parts: ::: ::: In Part I, we apply EL and semantify short text snippets with KB entities. While only retrieving ::: types and categories from DBpedia for each entity, we are able to leverage this information ::: to create semantically coherent clusters of text snippets. This pipeline of connecting text to ::: background knowledge via the mentioned entities will be reused in all following chapters. ::: ::: In Part II, we focus on semantic similarity and extend the idea of semantifying text with entities ::: by proposing in Chapter 5 a model that represents whole documents by their entities. In this ::: model, comparing documents semantically with each other is viewed as the task of comparing ::: the semantic relatedness of the respective entities, which we address in Chapter 4. We propose ::: an unsupervised graph weighting schema and show that weighting the DBpedia KG leads to ::: better results on an existing entity ranking dataset. The exploration of weighted KG paths turns ::: out to be also useful when trying to disambiguate the entities from an open information extraction ::: (OIE) system in Chapter 6. With this weighting schema, the integration of KG information ::: for computing semantic document similarity in Chapter 5 becomes the task of comparing the two ::: KG subgraphs with each other, which we address by an approximate subgraph matching. Based ::: on a well-established evaluation dataset for semantic document similarity, we show that our unsupervised ::: method achieves competitive performance similar to other state-of-the-art methods. ::: Our results from this part indicate that KGs can contain helpful background knowledge, in particular ::: when exploring KG paths, but that selecting the relevant parts of the graph is an important ::: yet difficult challenge. ::: ::: In Part III, we shift to the task of relevance ranking and first study in Chapter 7 how to best ::: retrieve KB entities for a given keyword query. Combining again text with KB information, we ::: extract entities from the top-k retrieved, query-specific documents and then link the documents ::: to two different KBs, namely Wikipedia and DBpedia. In a learning-to-rank setting, we study ::: extensively which features from the text, theWikipedia KB, and the DBpedia KG can be helpful ::: for ranking entities with respect to the query. Experimental results on two datasets, which build ::: upon existing TREC document retrieval collections, indicate that the document-based mention ::: frequency of an entity and the Wikipedia-based query-to-entity similarity are both important ::: features for ranking. The KG paths in contrast play only a minor role in this setting, even when ::: integrated with a semantic kernel extension. In Chapter 8, we further extend the integration of ::: query-specific text documents and KG information, by extracting not only entities, but also relations ::: from text. In this exploratory study based on a self-created relevance dataset, we find that ::: not all extracted relations are relevant with respect to the query, but that they often contain information ::: not contained within the DBpedia KG. The main insight from the research presented in ::: this part is that in a query-specific setting, established IR methods for document retrieval provide ::: an important source of information even for entity-centric tasks, and that a close integration of ::: relevant text document and background knowledge is promising. ::: ::: Finally, in the concluding chapter we argue that future research should further address the integration ::: of KG information with entities and relations extracted from (specific) text documents, ::: as their potential seems to be not fully explored yet. The same holds also true for a better KG ::: exploration, which has gained some scientific interest in recent years.

However, remote sensing images vary under different observing conditions, which bring big challenges to detection missions. This paper proposes an accurate green tide detection method based on an Elegant End-to-End Fully Convolutional Network (E3FCN) using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. In preprocessing, RS images are firstly separated into subimages by a sliding window. To detect GT pixels more efficiently, the original Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCN) architecture is modified into E3FCN, which can be trained end-to-end. The E3FCN model can be divided into two parts, contracting path and expanding path. The contracting path aims to extract high-level features and the expanding path aims to provide a pixel-level prediction by using a skip technique. The prediction result of whole image is generated by merging the prediction results of subimages, which can also improve the final performance. Experiment results show that the average precision of E3FCN on the whole data sets is 98.06%, compared to 73.27% of Support Vector Regression (SVR), 71.75% of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and 64.41% of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI).", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/prrs.2018.8486160", "venue": "2018 10th IAPR Workshop on Pattern Recognition in Remote Sensing (PRRS)", "journal": "2018 10th IAPR Workshop on Pattern Recognition in Remote Sensing (PRRS)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2896028345", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["33728808", "36172842", "129016842", "56459053", "128618949", "18098865", "195908774", "56507745", "3719281", "30918215", "8778184", "22587592", "12118055", "6510239", "15480929"], "inbound_citations": ["76655323"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52960096"}

Indeed, human activity recognition pays more attention on the extraction of relevant and discriminative features whose the implementation facilitates the seamless monitoring of functional inhabitant abilities with the involvement of sensing technology in the smart home environments. However, despite the exponential efforts made by individual standard machine learning techniques, and recently by the remarkable breakthrough of deep learning methods, designing robust activity recognition architecture remains a major challenge in term of performance, due to a high degree of uncertainty and complexity caused by inherent behavior of human actions. For the former case, the drawbacks are essentially composed of heuristic and hand-crafted methods for features extraction, shallow features learning, and learning of low amount of well-labeled data. While the latter suffers from imbalanced datasets and problematic data quality in real-life datasets. In addition, the choice of suitable sensor types is also critical for successful human activity recognition. This paper proposes an ensemble of deep classifier techniques based on hybrid sensor types composed of wearable and environment interactive sensors to improve the prediction and recognition performance of activities of daily living in smart home environments. Indeed, this ensemble is designed by combining the both automatically learned features and hand-crafted features from Denoising Stacked Autoencoders (DSAE) and Random Forest (RF) algorithm respectively. Specifically, the combination involves both the features and outputs of the two techniques using stacking learning. The use of two public benchmark datasets has enabled to evaluate our approach. Furthermore, the experimental results show the accuracy improvement of the ensembles of deep autoencoders classifiers compared to denoising stacked autoencoder networks and random forest algorithm performed individually.

The vehicle mode detection module is responsible for recognizing both motorized vehicles, such as cars, buses, and motorbikes, and non-motorized ones, for instance, walking, and bikes. It relies only on accelerometer data in order to minimize the energy consumption of smartphones.

We therefore replace the fully factorized distribution of Mean Field by a weighted mixture of such distributions, that similarly minimizes the KL-Divergence to the true posterior. By introducing two new ideas, namely, conditioning on groups of variables instead of single ones and using a parameter of the conditional random field potentials, that we identify to the temperature in the sense of statistical physics to select such groups, we can perform this minimization efficiently. Our extension of the clamping method proposed in previous works allows us to both produce a more descriptive approximation of the true posterior and, inspired by the diverse MAP paradigms, fit a mixture of Mean Field approximations.

Traditional defect prediction features are static code metrics, which only contain statistic information of programs and fail to capture semantics in programs, leading to the degradation of defect prediction performance. To take full advantage of the semantics and static metrics of programs, we propose a framework called Defect Prediction via Attention Mechanism (DP-AM) in this paper. Specifically, DPAM first extracts vectors which are then encoded as digital vectors by mapping and word embedding from abstract syntax trees (ASTs) of programs. Then it feeds these numerical vectors into Recurrent Neural Network to automatically learn semantic features of programs. After that, it applies self-attention mechanism to further build relationship among these features. Furthermore, it employs global attention mechanism to generate significant features among them.

Therefore, to achieve a model which is able to simulate UHI growth, urban expansion should be concerned first. Considerable researches on urban expansion modeling have been done based on cellular automata. Accordingly the objective of this paper is to implement CA method for trend detection of Tehran UHI spatiotemporal growth based on urban sprawl parameters (such as Distance to nearest road, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Slope and Aspect ratios). It should be mentioned that UHI growth modeling may have more complexities in comparison with urban expansion, since the amount of each pixel\u2019s temperature should be investigated instead of its state (urban and non-urban areas). The most challenging part of CA model is the definition of Transfer Rules. Here, two methods have used to find appropriate transfer Rules which are Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). The reason of choosing these approaches is that artificial neural networks and support vector regression have significant abilities to handle the complications of such a spatial analysis in comparison with other methods like Genetic or Swarm intelligence. In this paper, UHI change trend has discussed between 1984 and 2007. For this purpose, urban sprawl parameters in 1984 have calculated and added to the retrieved LST of this year. In order to achieve LST, Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) night-time images have exploited. The reason of implementing night-time images is that UHI phenomenon is more obvious during night hours. After that multilayer feed-forward neural networks and support vector regression have used separately to find the relationship between this data and the retrieved LST in 2007. Since the transfer rules might not be the same in different regions, the satellite image of the city has divided to several parts and for each part a specific CA model has defined. In the training step some pixels have randomly selected to calibrate the neural network and the regression. Then, using the trained neural network and support vector regression, LST in year 2007 has retrieved for all pixels. Results have indicated a great relationship between the simulated LST and the real one which has retrieved from thermal band of satellite image in 2007 (r = 0.843 for ANN method and r = 0.856 for SVR method).

They consist of a memoryless readout neuron that is trained on top of a randomly connected recurrent neural network. RC systems are commonly used in two flavors: with analog or binary (spiking) neurons in the recurrent circuits. Previous work indicated a fundamental difference in the behavior of these two implementations of the RC idea. The performance of an RC system built from binary neurons seems to depend strongly on the network connectivity structure. In networks of analog neurons, such clear dependency has not been observed. In this letter, we address this apparent dichotomy by investigating the influence of the network connectivity (parameterized by the neuron in-degree) on a family of network models that interpolates between analog and binary networks. Our analyses are based on a novel estimation of the Lyapunov exponent of the network dynamics with the help of branching process theory, rank measures that estimate the kernel quality and generalization capabilities of recurrent networks, and a novel mean field predictor for computational performance.

Twitter, the most popular micro-blogging platform, has become a hotbed for users who are involved in different activities such as news publishing, job hunting, recruiting, advertising and publicity. Retweeting a tweet is a major action to broadcast a user\u2019s message out to millions of users. Retweet action has two major advantages: (i) gaining quick exposure to the content, and (ii) increasing likelihood of gaining new Twitter followers in return. The organic way of gaining a larger number of retweets is a time consuming process, which leads to the creation of unfair methods to gain retweets. Thus, Twitter users often approach various blackmarket services to gain retweets inorganically in a short duration. Blackmarkets spread their collusive ecosystem in such a way that Twitter is unable to detect them even after devoting significant effort to purge the platform off bots, trolls, and fake accounts. One major reason behind the evasion is that the collusive users involved in blackmarket services exhibit a mix of organic and inorganic behavior \u2013 they organically reweet some genuine tweets; at the same time, they inorganically retweet tweets submitted to blackmarket services. This paper is the first attempt to provide a thorough study of the collusive users involved in two types of blackmarket services \u2013 Premium and Freemium. We collect a novel dataset of collusive users comprising of users from both types of blackmarket services. We provide network-centric, profile-centric, timeline-centric and retweet-centric characteristics of these users and show how users involved in premium blackmarket services exhibit diverse behavior as compared to those involved in freemium services. We further employ human annotators to label collusive users into three types: bots, promotional customers, and normal customers. We then curate 63 novel features to run state-of-the-art classifiers in two settings \u2013 binary classification (collusive vs. genuine) and multi-class classification (bot, promotional customers, normal customers, and genuine users). Bagging achieves the best accuracy (macro F1-score of 0.892) in the former setting, whereas Random Forest outperforms others (macro F1-score of 0.791) in the latter setting.

Blood samples were collected from each patient before and during radiotherapy (RT). From each sample the concentration of the five following candidate biomarkers were measured: alpha\u20102\u2010macroglobulin (\u03b12M), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u2010\u03b2), interleukin\u20106 (IL\u20106), and osteopontin (OPN). Dimensionality of the raw biomarker data was reduced by a semi\u2010supervised variable selection scheme. The reduced biomarker variables along with three known dosimetric RP predictors (mean lung dose, V20, tumor position in superior\u2010inferior direction of the lung) were used as features for classifying high RP risk (CTCAE grade 2 or higher) patients. Four different machine learning methods (Bayesian Network, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine) were used for training classifiers on the WUSTL subset and were tested with respect to classification performance on the McGill subset. Results: The following 4 biomarker variables were chosen by the variable filtering: (1) pre\u2010RT concentration level of \u03b12M, (2) ratio of pre\u2010to intra\u2010RT levels of \u03b12M, (3) intra\u2010RT ACE level, (4) intra\u2010RT TGF\u03b2 level.

The On-line Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) has been successfully used in real-time condition prediction applications because of its good generalization performance at an extreme learning speed, but the number of trainings by a second (training frequency) achieved in these continuous learning applications has to be further reduced. This paper proposes a performance-optimized implementation of the OS-ELM training algorithm when it is applied to real-time applications. In this case, the natural way of feeding the training of the neural network is one-by-one, i.e., training the neural network for each new incoming training input vector. Applying this restriction, the computational needs are drastically reduced. An FPGA-based implementation of the tailored OS-ELM algorithm is used to analyze, in a parameterized way, the level of optimization achieved. We observed that the tailored algorithm drastically reduces the number of clock cycles consumed for the training execution up to approximately the 1%. This performance enables high-speed sequential training ratios, such as 14 KHz of sequential training frequency for a 40 hidden neurons SLFN, or 180 Hz of sequential training frequency for a 500 hidden neurons SLFN. In practice, the proposed implementation computes the training almost 100 times faster, or more, than other applications in the bibliography. Besides, clock cycles follows a quadratic complexity O ( N \u02dc 2 ) , with N \u02dc the number of hidden neurons, and are poorly influenced by the number of input neurons. However, it shows a pronounced sensitivity to data type precision even facing small-size problems, which force to use double floating-point precision data types to avoid finite precision arithmetic effects. In addition, it has been found that distributed memory is the limiting resource and, thus, it can be stated that current FPGA devices can support OS-ELM-based on-chip learning of up to 500 hidden neurons. Concluding, the proposed hardware implementation of the OS-ELM offers great possibilities for on-chip learning in portable systems and real-time applications where frequent and fast training is required.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/electronics7110308", "venue": null, "journal": "Electronics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2900362930", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["29745359", "54048569", "8412321", "6689077", "2051753", "116858", "26610102", "117393642", "53363441", "10229437", "16888781", "19810544", "46009305", "206712216", "7028394", "981528", "18411660", "63867999", "5291420", "3681794", "3938100", "5796834", "125212697", "23585162", "21277040", "53768014", "7529371", "55910979", "24964864", "27810521", "14220380", "53946001", "3209260", "51870239", "16907717", "760370"], "inbound_citations": ["214428615", "195785410", "209169177", "195477985", "210895037"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:115450920"}

Identifying the sections of a paper would help filter noise in entity and relation extraction. In this research, we studied the paper section identification problem in the context of Chinese medical literature analysis, where the subjects, methods, and results are more valuable from a physician's perspective. Based on previous studies on English literature section identification, we experiment with the effective features to use with classic machine learning algorithms to tackle the problem. It is found that Conditional Random Fields, which consider sentence interdependency, is more effective in combining different feature sets, such as bag-of-words, part-of-speech, and headings, for Chinese literature section identification. Moreover, we find that classic machine learning algorithms are more effective than generic deep learning models for this problem. Based on these observations, we design a novel deep learning model, the Structural Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (SLSTM) model, which models word and sentence interdependency together with the contextual information. Experiments on a human-curated asthma literature dataset show that our approach outperforms the traditional machine learning methods and other deep learning methods and achieves close to 90% precision and recall in the task. The model shows good potential for use in other text mining tasks.

Because of the strong absorption and scattering effects that occur underwater, some ground truth such as the depth map, which can be easily collected in-air, becomes a great challenge in underwater environments. To solve the issues associated with the lack of underwater ground truth, we propose a trainable end-to-end system of an underwater multistyle generative adversarial network (UMGAN) that takes advantage of a cycle-consistent adversarial network (CycleGAN) and conditional generative adversarial networks. This system can generate multiple realistic underwater images from in-air images using a hybrid adversarial system and an unpaired method. Moreover, our model can translate in-air images to underwater images that retain the main content and structural information of the in-air images under specified turbidities or water styles through a style classifier and a conditional vector. Furthermore, we define the color loss and include the structural similarity index measure loss for the system to preserve the content and structure of original in-air images while transferring the backgrounds of the images from air to water. Using UMGAN, we can take advantage of the in-air ground truth and convert the corresponding in-air images into an underwater dataset with multiple water color styles. Our experiments demonstrate that our synthesized underwater images have a high score on image assessment against CycleGAN, WaterGAN, StarGAN, AdaIN, and other state-of-the-art methods.

The existing energy minimization based methods employ multiple, manually handcrafted cost terms and often fail in the presence of pathologies. In this work, we eliminate the need to handcraft the energy by learning it from training images in an end-to-end manner. Our method can be easily adapted to pathologies by re-training it on an appropriate dataset. Methods: ::: We propose a Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework for the joint multi-layer segmentation of OCT B-scans. The appearance of each retinal layer and boundary is modeled by two convolutional filter banks and the shape priors are modeled using Gaussian distributions. The total CRF energy is linearly parameterized to allow a joint, end-to-end training by employing the Structured Support Vector Machine formulation. Results: ::: The proposed method outperformed three benchmark algorithms on four public datasets. The NORMAL-1 and NORMAL-2 datasets contain healthy OCT B-scans while the AMD-1 and DME-1 dataset contain B-scans of AMD and DME cases respectively. The proposed method achieved an average unsigned boundary localization error (U-BLE) of 1.52 pixels on NORMAL-1, 1.11 pixels on NORMAL-2 and 2.04 pixels on the combined NORMAL-1 and DME-1 dataset across the eight layer boundaries, outperforming the three benchmark methods in each case. The Dice coefficient was 0.87 on NORMAL-1, 0.89 on NORMAL-2 and 0.84 on the combined NORMAL-1 and DME-1 dataset across the seven retinal layers. On the combined NORMAL-1 and AMD-1 dataset, we achieved an average U-BLE of 1.86 pixels on the ILM, inner and outer RPE boundaries and a Dice of 0.98 for the ILM-RPEin region and 0.81 for the RPE layer. Conclusion: ::: We have proposed a supervised CRF based method to jointly segment multiple tissue layers in OCT images. It can aid the ophthalmologists in the quantitative analysis of structural changes in the retinal tissue layers for clinical practice and large-scale clinical studies.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30337078", "doi": "10.1016/j.cmpb.2018.09.004", "venue": "Computer methods and programs in biomedicine", "journal": "Computer methods and programs in biomedicine", "mag_id": "2892143932", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53018462"}

However, existing methods cannot directly optimize these indifferentiable perceptual metrics, which are shown to be highly correlated with human ratings. To address the problem, we propose Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks with Ranker (RankSRGAN) to optimize generator in the direction of perceptual metrics. Specifically, we first train a Ranker which can learn the behavior of perceptual metrics and then introduce a novel rank-content loss to optimize the perceptual quality. The most appealing part is that the proposed method can combine the strengths of different SR methods to generate better results. Extensive experiments show that RankSRGAN achieves visually pleasing results and reaches state-of-the-art performance in perceptual metrics.

In this work, we experiment with variants of GAN architectures to generate feature vectors corresponding to an emotion in two ways: (i) A generator is trained with samples from a mixture prior. Each mixture component corresponds to an emotional class and can be sampled to generate features from the corresponding emotion. (ii) A one-hot vector corresponding to an emotion can be explicitly used to generate the features. We perform analysis on such models and also propose different metrics used to measure the performance of the GAN models in their ability to generate realistic synthetic samples.

Recently, least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) method has gained much attention in streamflow forecasting due to its ability to model complex non-linear relationships.

In this paper, we attempt to improve the performance of LSSVM method from the aspect of data preprocessing by singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and discrete wavelet analysis (DWA). Kharjeguil and Ponel stations from Northern Iran are investigated with monthly streamflow data. The root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), correlation coefficient (R) and coefficient of efficiency (CE) statistics are used as comparing criteria. The results indicate that both SSA and DWA can significantly improve the performance of forecasting model.

Recently, several Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) based methods have achieved great success. They can generate colorized illustrations conditioned on given line art and color hints. However, these methods fail to capture the authentic illustration distributions and are hence perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they often lack accurate shading. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep conditional adversarial architecture for scribble based anime line art colorization. Specifically, we integrate the conditional framework with WGAN-GP criteria as well as the perceptual loss to enable us to robustly train a deep network that makes the synthesized images more natural and real. We also introduce a local features network that is independent of synthetic data.

The patient group included 425 lung cancer patients, 168 patients with non-cancerous lung diseases, and 550 healthy volunteers. Saliva samples were collected from all participants in the experiment before treatment and 34 biochemical saliva parameters were determined. Participants were monitored for six years to assess survival rates. The statistical analysis was performed by means of Statistica 10.0 (StatSoft) program and R package (version 3.2.3). To construct the classifier, the Random Forest method was used; the classification quality was assessed using the cross-validation method. Prognostic factors were analyzed by multivariate analysis using Cox's proportional hazard model in a backward step-wise fashion to adjust for potential confounding factors. A complex of metabolic changes occurring in saliva in lung cancer is described. Seven biochemical parameters were identified (catalase, triene conjugates, Schiff bases, pH, sialic acids, alkaline phosphatase, chlorides), which were used to construct the classifier. The sensitivity and specificity of the method were 69.5% and 87.5%, which is practically not inferior to the diagnostic characteristics of markers routinely used in the diagnosis of lung cancer. Significant independent factors in the poor prognosis of lung cancer are imidazole compounds (ICs) above 0.478 mmol/L and salivary lactate dehydrogenase activity below 545 U/L.

While the two tasks are strongly correlated and mutually beneficial, they are usually solved separately or sequentially. Motivated by the complementary properties of the two tasks, we propose a unified framework for joint depth and semantic prediction. Given an image, we first use a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to jointly predict a global layout composed of pixel-wise depth values and semantic labels. By allowing for interactions between the depth and semantic information, the joint network provides more accurate depth prediction than a state-of-the-art CNN trained solely for depth prediction [6].

However, the prediction interval (PI) is derived by the optimization on the prediction-related index which is not constructed for the application of anomaly detection, and its performance will be discounted in this case. Thus, this paper introduces the detection-related index, i.e., coverage-width-based criterion (CWC), to optimize the model parameters which focus on the width of PI, as well as the coverage probability of PI.

Here, we investigate the biomarker function and nutritional stoichiometry of neutral lipid fatty acids (NLFA) and amino acids in oribatid mites. We reared the opportunistic model oribatid mite species Archegozetes longisetosus on ten different resources of animal, bacterial, fungal and herbal origin.

We found diet-dependent amounts and compositions of NLFA in the oribatid mites, but amino acids were stable and independent of diet.

Kernel methods represent a rich family of techniques that harvest on this principle. Domain-specific kernels are able to exploit rich structural information present in the input data to deliver state of the art results in many application areas, e.g. natural language processing (NLP), bio-informatics, computer vision and many others. The use of kernels to capture relationships in the input data has made Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm the state of the art tool in many application areas. Nevertheless, kernel learning remains a computationally expensive process. The contribution of this paper is to make learning with structural kernels, e.g. tree kernels, more applicable to real-world large-scale tasks. More specifically, we propose two important enhancements of the approximate cutting plane algorithm to train Support Vector Machines with structural kernels: (i) a new sampling strategy to handle class-imbalanced problem; and (ii) a parallel implementation, which makes the training scale almost linearly with the number of CPUs. We also show that theoretical convergence bounds are preserved for the improved algorithm.

Considering the coupling of energy sources and the randomness and uncertainty of load forecasting in integrated energy system, a short-term multi-load interval forecasting method for integrated energy system based on Multi-task learning is proposed in this paper. Firstly, multi-task learning is adopted to establish a close relationship between multiple energy sources. Secondly, the RELM optimized by PSO is used to establish the multivariate interval prediction model.

The Nayband national marine park is located in the PSEEZ and mangrove forests are spread throughout the estuaries (Bidkhun or Asaloyeh, Basatin and Haleh) of the park. Despite important goods and ecosystem services of mangroves and their high economic value, mangroves within the PSEEZ are threatened by activities of the oil industry. Thus, it is necessary to monitor and assess the mangroves and their ecosystem services. In this context, remote sensing technologies provide effective tools for spatio-temporal analysis of mangrove distribution. In this study, Landsat-5, 7, 8 images were used from 1986 to 2018. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Sen's slope was employed for monitoring mangrove cover changes and estimating Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) trends. In assessing the economic value of the ecosystem services of the Mangrove forests, the mangrove distribution changes and global values of mangrove ecosystem services were integrated. The results revealed that the coverage of mangroves had increased to about nearly 204.93 ha in area from 1986 to 2003, followed by a drop to 169.29 ha in 2018. The economic value of mangrove forests of the PSEEZ in 1986, 1998, 2003, 2015 and 2018 was estimated to be about 3.3, 3.8, 6.7, 6.5 and 5.5 million US dollars per year, respectively. Based on Sen's slope, the NDVI trend in Basatin estuary decreased at a rate of \u22120.001, but showed significant increases of about 0.008 and 0.006 for the Bidkhun and the Haleh estuaries, respectively. Despite the suitable distribution and an economic value of $1.9 million in 1986, conditions of the Basatin estuary seem to have diminished from 1986 to 2018 (economic value of $0.71 million in 2018). The Bidkhun estuary, which showed a positive trend in distribution changes, has also been downgrading since 2015 to about 30.43 ha in size, and an economic value of $1 million. Since 1998, the mangroves of Haleh estuary have been improving distribution-wise, with further elevations in economic value ($ 0.26 million in 2018).", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.104838", "venue": null, "journal": "Ocean & Coastal Management", "mag_id": "2948217780", "mag_field_of_study": ["Economics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195491243"}

HRRPs from a period of continuous changing aspect angles are jointly modeled and discriminated by a single model named the discriminative infinite restricted Boltzmann machine (Dis-iRBM). Compared with the commonly used hidden Markov model (HMM)-based recognition method for HRRP sequences, which requires efficient preprocessing of the HRRP signal, the proposed method is an end-to-end method of which the input is the raw HRRP sequence, and the output is the label of the target. The proposed model can efficiently capture the global pattern in a sequence, while the HMM can only model local dynamics, which suffers from information loss. Last but not least, the proposed model learns the features of HRRP sequences adaptively according to the complexity of a single HRRP and the length of a HRRP sequence.

Thus, associating phenotypes to ~omics data requires an approach that is robust to noise and can handle large and diverse data sets.ResultsWe developed a web-tool PhenoLink (http://bamics2.cmbi.ru.nl/websoftware/phenolink/) that links phenotype to ~omics data sets using well-established as well new techniques. PhenoLink imputes missing values and preprocesses input data (i) to decrease inherent noise in the data and (ii) to counterbalance pitfalls of the Random Forest algorithm, on which feature (e.g., gene) selection is based. Preprocessed data is used in feature (e.g., gene) selection to identify relations to phenotypes. We applied PhenoLink to identify gene-phenotype relations based on the presence/absence of 2847 genes in 42 Lactobacillus plantarum strains and phenotypic measurements of these strains in several experimental conditions, including growth on sugars and nitrogen-dioxide production. Genes were ranked based on their importance (predictive value) to correctly predict the phenotype of a given strain. In addition to known gene to phenotype relations we also found novel relations.ConclusionsPhenoLink is an easily accessible web-tool to facilitate identifying relations from large and often noisy phenotype and ~omics datasets. Visualization of links to phenotypes offered in PhenoLink allows prioritizing links, finding relations between features, finding relations between phenotypes, and identifying outliers in phenotype data. PhenoLink can be used to uncover phenotype links to a multitude of ~omics data, e.g., gene presence/absence (determined by e.g.: CGH or next-generation sequencing), gene expression (determined by e.g.: microarrays or RNA-seq), or metabolite abundance (determined by e.g.: GC-MS).", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3366882", "pubmed_id": "22559291", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2164-13-170", "venue": "BMC Genomics", "journal": "BMC Genomics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2101298000", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["9914235", "17941792", "18818287", "119479891", "8529157", "39001708", "18303836", "39415416", "29125452", "17611572", "33098754", "206970176", "3093707", "6258394", "13493830", "7308660", "7581585", "45174121", "2700202", "1368153", "159023825", "15182488"], "inbound_citations": ["5543705", "4391082", "13693455", "51625983", "18505762", "2205672", "214893578", "20221343", "89971172", "6997203", "6008741", "28744014", "15002769", "609649", "725094", "196689467", "19986266", "215386582", "196640904", "14906118", "8203741", "3163740", "59413726", "2641928", "7161110", "2769144", "15338343"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:92824"}

The work proposes a novel idea of mapping features of source domain to the features of target domain. The model designed for one dataset is applied to another dataset of related domain. The idea throws light upon two subjects namely spam filtering and academic performance analysis. Spam filtering is one of the never-ending problems in the present Internet age. As the spammers guess the type of filter built, there exists a need to design an adaptive filter. The proposed idea is to collect data from a single user mailbox and adapt it to other users. The unseen tokens are estimated using Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which eliminates zero probability issue. There is an increase in recall value by a minimum of 6.6% from the existing approach. Secondly, the academic performance prediction for school and college students has similar features and hence, the model has been adapted as well. Adaptive mapping is used to map related features between the source and the target. Therefore, the constructed model from the source domain can predict the target data. The proposed classification model shows an increase in accuracy by 7.5% and evaluation accuracy by 75%.

Objectives: The objective of the study is to describe the development of supervised machine-learning techniques for the eDrugTrends platform to automatically classify tweets by type/source of communication (personal, official/media, retail) and sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) expressed in cannabis- and synthetic cannabinoid\u2013related tweets. Methods: Tweets were collected using Twitter streaming Application Programming Interface and filtered through the eDrugTrends platform using keywords related to cannabis, marijuana edibles, marijuana concentrates, and synthetic cannabinoids. After creating coding rules and assessing intercoder reliability, a manually labeled data set (N=4000) was developed by coding several batches of randomly selected subsets of tweets extracted from the pool of 15,623,869 collected by eDrugTrends (May-November 2015). Out of 4000 tweets, 25% (1000/4000) were used to build source classifiers and 75% (3000/4000) were used for sentiment classifiers. Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were used to train the classifiers. Source classification (n=1000) tested Approach 1 that used short URLs, and Approach 2 where URLs were expanded and included into the bag-of-words analysis. For sentiment classification, Approach 1 used all tweets, regardless of their source/type (n=3000), while Approach 2 applied sentiment classification to personal communication tweets only (2633/3000, 88%). Multiclass and binary classification tasks were examined, and machine-learning sentiment classifier performance was compared with Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning (VADER), a lexicon and rule-based method. The performance of each classifier was assessed using 5-fold cross validation that calculated average F-scores. One-tailed t test was used to determine if differences in F-scores were statistically significant. Results: In multiclass source classification, the use of expanded URLs did not contribute to significant improvement in classifier performance (0.7972 vs 0.8102 for SVM, P=.19). In binary classification, the identification of all source categories improved significantly when unshortened URLs were used, with personal communication tweets benefiting the most (0.8736 vs 0.8200, P<.001). In multiclass sentiment classification Approach 1, SVM (0.6723) performed similarly to NB (0.6683) and LR (0.6703). In Approach 2, SVM (0.7062) did not differ from NB (0.6980, P=.13) or LR (F=0.6931, P=.05), but it was over 40% more accurate than VADER (F=0.5030, P<.001). In multiclass task, improvements in sentiment classification (Approach 2 vs Approach 1) did not reach statistical significance (eg, SVM: 0.7062 vs 0.6723, P=.052). In binary sentiment classification (positive vs negative), Approach 2 (focus on personal communication tweets only) improved classification results, compared with Approach 1, for LR (0.8752 vs 0.8516, P=.04) and SVM (0.8800 vs 0.8557, P=.045). Conclusions: The study provides an example of the use of supervised machine learning methods to categorize cannabis- and synthetic cannabinoid\u2013related tweets with fairly high accuracy. Use of these content analysis tools along with geographic identification capabilities developed by the eDrugTrends platform will provide powerful methods for tracking regional changes in user opinions related to cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids use over time and across different regions.

But relational information between objects is also important to the knowledge hidden in today\u2019s databases. Two such domains are chemical structures and domains where objects are related in space and time. Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) discovery systems handle relational data, but require data to be expressed as a subset of first-order logic. We are investigating the application of the graph-based relational discovery system SUBDUE (Cook, Holder, Djoko 1996) in structural domains. Input to SUBDUE is a graph with labeled vertices and directed or undirected labeled edges. SUBDUE performs a beam search of the space of all possible subgraphs of the input graph. The search is guided by the minimum description length (MDL) principle, looking for subgraphs (substructures) with many instances that can be used to compress the original data and represent structural knowledge. We applied SUBDUE to the task of identifying structural patterns that distinguish carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic chemical compounds available from the National Toxicology Program (ntpserver.niehs.nih.gov). Each atom in a compound is represented as a vertex with directed edges to other vertices, where the edge labels specify whether the vertex is the atom name, type or partial charge. Bonds between atoms are represented as undirected edges between the vertices. We divided the data into a training set (268 compounds) and a testing set (30 compounds). SUBDUE found a substructure containing a bromine atom that occurred in 134 of the 143 carcinogenic training compounds and in only 24 of the 125 noncarcinogenic training compounds. This same substructure was found in 15 of the 19 carcinogenic testing compounds and in only 4 of the 11 noncarcinogenic testing compounds. The results are similar to those of ILP systems like PROGOL (Srinivasan ct aL 1997). We are experimenting with a new concept-learning version of SUBDUE that finds substructures compressing the positive data without compressing the negative data.

Analysis of these parameters enables the identification of specific animal behaviors - however the analysis process is immature with much of the activity identification steps undertaken manually and subjectively. Consequently, there is an urgent need for the development of new tools to streamline the management, analysis, indexing, querying and visualization of such data.

The interactive Web interface enables biologists to visualize and correlate 3D accelerometer data streams with associated video streams. It also enables domain experts to accurately annotate or tag segments of tri-axial accelerometer data streams, with standardized terms from an activity ontology. These annotated data streams can then be used to dynamically train a hierarchical SVM activity classification model, which can be applied to new accelerometer data streams to automatically recognize specific activities. This paper describes the design, implementation and functional details of the SAAR system and the results of the evaluation experiments that assess the performance, usability and efficiency of the system.

To achieve this purpose, a seasonal invariant term is introduced to maximally suppress pseudochanges, whereas the MeGAN explores the transition patterns between adjacent images in a self-learning fashion. Different from the previous works on bitemporal imagery change detection, the proposed MeGAN have the following contributions: 1) it automatically explores change patterns from the complex bitemporal background without human intervention and 2) it aims to maximally exclude pseudochanges from the seasonal transition term and map out real changes efficiently.

Catchment based models which include gully erosion have received increased attention in recent years due to the impact of gully erosion on downstream water quality. These types of models take gully erosion calculated via a deterministic model at a particular spatial location, along with other measures of erosion to provide an end-of-catchment load. Although seen as a major contributor to erosion in this type of modelling framework, the error surrounding the gully erosion calculation is ignored in the sediment model. We propose a methodology that investigates the error in the gully erosion model. The methodology uses Random Forests to predict gully density and its associated prediction error across a catchment using environmental variables, which are then incorporated into the gully erosion model. We demonstrate the approach using the Burdekin catchment in Queensland, Australia, where only a very small proportion of gullies (\u223c0.88%) have been mapped.

Besides, the real-world data may contain various uncertainty, especially for the image data. The uncertainty can mislead the learning procedure and cause the performance degradation. By investigating the image data, we find that the original data can be observed from a small set of clean latent examples with different distortions. In this work, we propose the margin preserving metric learning framework to learn the distance metric and latent examples simultaneously. By leveraging the ideal properties of latent examples, the training efficiency can be improved significantly while the learned metric also becomes robust to the uncertainty in the original data.

The present thesis sets forth one of its main themes on new regularization methods that can lead to SVM formulations. It also deals with efficiently tracing the solution paths for a broad family of SVMs as their regularization parameters take every possible value. ::: The thesis devotes a significant portion to new regularization methods and their applicable domains. For ensemble learning, the thesis proposes a set of regularized linear combination approaches, which outperform many ensemble methods that are heuristic in nature and do not have a well-defined objective function. Consequently as driven by the different effects of sparse weights on regression and classification ensembles, the thesis further contributes two extended studies on regularization methods. First, a zero-norm support vector regression is proposed to progressively reduce the number of nonzero weights; second, an entropy penalty criterion together with large margin constraints is developed to conservatively keep the weights as uniformly as possible in improving empirical performance. Due to the different even contrary nature of these two extensions, they are applied to different scenarios. The zero-norm approach is tested on real regression data. It demonstrates the favorable properties of selecting a compact set of feature coefficients and tolerating small fitting errors. While the entropy approach is used to optimize the majority voting of the bagging approach in classification ensemble learning. Both the extensions achieve performance improvement for the original tasks. However, they are limited to conventional classification and regression tasks, thus inapt at the new learning scenarios where unlabelled data are plenty and the data show intrinsic smoothness. To overcome this limitation, the thesis designs a new regularized objective function that takes into account the manifold consistency over all labelled and unlabelled data through a graph operator. It can achieve significant performance gain on pattern recognition tasks by only requiring a small training set. ::: The second part of the thesis is centered on regularization parameters, by focusing on tracing the piecewise linear solution paths for a broad family of SVMs. It is a work that can help parameter sensitivity analysis and model selection. The thesis presents a unified approach that can trace the solution paths more systematically and robustly. Compared with existing approaches, this method is in a principled way and generalizes to many SVM variants. In addition, a thorough study on the degenerated cases in tracing solution paths is conducted, and efficient methods to handle degenerated cases are proposed. More importantly, the approach has drawn a novel relation with classic Mean-Variance portfolio optimization techniques and is of potential to revitalize the parametric quadratic programming study.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2516496365", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:126069440"}

Differentiation between vasogenic edema and non-contrast enhancing tumor is difficult as both appear hyperintense in T2-W/FLAIR images. Most studies involving differentiation between vasogenic edema and non-enhancing tumor consider radiologist-based tumor delineation as the ground truth. However, analysis by a radiologist can be subjective and there remain both inter- and intra-rater differences. The objective of the current study is to develop a methodology for differentiation between non-enhancing tumor and vasogenic edema in HGG patients based on T1 perfusion MRI parameters, using a ground truth which is independent of a radiologist's manual delineation of the tumor. ::: ::: ::: MATERIAL AND METHODS ::: This study included 9 HGG patients with pre- and post-surgery MRI data and 9 metastasis patients with pre-surgery MRI data. MRI data included conventional T1-W, T2-W, and FLAIR images and DCE-MRI dynamic images. In this study, the authors hypothesize that surgeried non-enhancing FLAIR hyperintense tissue, which was obtained using pre- and post-surgery MRI images of glioma patients, should be largely comprised of non-enhancing tumor. Hence this could be used as an alternative ground truth for the non-enhancing tumor region. Histological examination of the resected tissue was done for validation. Vasogenic edema was obtained from the non-enhancing FLAIR hyperintense region of metastasis patients, as they have a clear boundary between enhancing tumor and edema. DCE-MRI data analysis was performed to obtain T1 perfusion MRI parameters. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification was performed using T1 perfusion MRI parameters to differentiate between non-enhancing tumor and vasogenic edema. Receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis was done on the results of the SVM classifier. For improved classification accuracy, the SVM output was post-processed via neighborhood smoothing. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Histology results showed that resected tissue consists largely of tumorous tissue with 7.21 \u00b1 4.05% edema and a small amount of healthy tissue. SVM-based classification provided a misclassification error of 8.4% in differentiation between non-enhancing tumor and vasogenic edema, which was further reduced to 2.4% using neighborhood smoothing. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: The current study proposes a semiautomatic method for segmentation between non-enhancing tumor and vasogenic edema in HGG patients, based on an SVM classifier trained on an alternative ground truth to a radiologist's manual delineation of a tumor. The proposed methodology may prove to be a useful tool for pre- and post-operative evaluation of glioma patients.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30150045", "doi": "10.1016/j.ejrad.2018.07.018", "venue": "European journal of radiology", "journal": "European journal of radiology", "mag_id": "2883764645", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["201118709", "215495208"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52096933"}

Recently, it has been demonstrated that bone strength depends not only on bone mass but also on factors related to bone quality, such as trabecular architecture and morphology. Current clinical methods for assessment of bone quality are largely dependent on assessing bone mass. However, these methods do not provide any information about bone structure which is considered to be an equally important factor in assessing bone quality. In this work, ridgelet transform based multi-scale geometric analysis is performed in radiographic images to characterize the trabecular structure. The trabecular regions of normal and abnormal human femur bone images (N=40) recorded under standard condition are used for the study. The regions of interest in the bone images are subjected to ridgelet transform for extracting useful features that evaluate changes taking place in the architecture of bone. The extracted features are correlated with apparent mineralization which is a key of representative architectural variation of the trabecular bone. Further to validate the results, images are also classified based on the extracted features using Support Vector Machines (SVM) with four different kernels. Results show that ridgelet transform are able to differentiate normal and abnormal femur bone images. The values of derived features such as energy and homogeneity are found to have good correlation with apparent mineralization.

Therefore in all the adaptive algorithms, two microphones are used, one for capturing noisy speech and the other for capturing noise signal alone. Always, capturing noise alone is difficult. To overcome the above constraint, we propose a novel method which identifies the best correlating part of the noise signal with respect to noise in noisy speech and this can be used as the reference for speech enhancement in adaptive algorithms. Once, best correlating noise is identified, Variable Step Size LMS (VSSLMS) and RLS algorithms are used for speech enhancement. Prior to this, noise classification is done to identify the type of noise present in the speech. Bark features and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used for noise classification. SVM based noise classification combined with the identification of the best correlating part of noise for using as reference in adaptive algorithms for single channel speech enhancement is proposed in this work.

The complexity of solid waste components and the inherent nonlinearity, time variation and uncertainty of MSWI process lead to the instability of flame image feature distribution. The traditional method based on fixed sliding window only extract fixed size features and cannot reflect global and local features, which lead to low recognition accuracy of combustion conditions. To address the issue, this paper proposes a model of combustion condition recognition in MSWI process based on multi-scale color moment features and random forest (RF). Firstly, the image is pre-processed by defogging and denoising. Then, the color moment features of different scales of the flame image is extracted via using sliding windows based on prior setting scales. Finally, taking the classification accuracy as the evaluation criterion, and the RF algorithm based on feature selection is adopted to realize accurate identification of combustion conditions.

As an added novelty, the proposed model integrates knowledge distillation and retrospection along with the path selection strategy to overcome catastrophic forgetting. In order to maintain an equilibrium between previous and newly acquired knowledge, we propose a simple controller to dynamically balance the model plasticity.

This is the technique of partially supervised classification. In this paper, we present an algorithm called Weighted Unlabeled Sample Support Vector Machine (WUS-SVM), based on which a new partially supervised classification method is proposed. In this method, a certain amount of unlabeled samples is first randomly selected from the test set and labeled as other classes with different weights. Second, a primary classifier is defined by WUS-SVM, in which a hyperplane is constructed to separate training samples of objective class and other classes with low weighted error and large margin width. Third, the primary classifier is used to determine the class of unlabeled samples. Thus all training samples are labeled and again they are used as training samples of support vector machines to obtain a final classifier, which is used to classify other test samples.

The scaled subprofile model with principal component analysis (SSM/PCA) is applied to FDG-PET data to extract features and corresponding patterns of glucose metabolism which can be used to distinguish PD subjects from healthy controls. From a previous study, the decision tree (DT) classifier\u2019s performance to separate the PD group from healthy controls was below chance level. This could be attributed to the small number of subjects in the dataset, combined with the early disease progression. In this study, we make use of an additional PD dataset, consisting of subject brain images obtained at a later disease stage. The features extracted by the SSM/PCA method are used for distinguishing PD subjects from healthy controls using three classification methods, that is, decision trees, Generalized Matrix Learning Vector Quantization (GMLVQ), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear kernel. The classifiers are validated to determine their capability of classification given new subject data. We compare the classifiers\u2019 performances on the distinct early-stage and late-stage datasets, as well on the combined datasets. We also use the early and late-stage datasets interchangeably for training and testing the classifiers. We find that the DT classification performance on the late-stage dataset is considerably better than in the previous study, where we used early-stage data. For early-stage patients, the application of the GMLVQ and SVM classifiers gives a significant improvement as compared to the DT classifier.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.14738/jbemi.36.2280", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Biomedical Engineering and Medical Imaging", "mag_id": "2547429460", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["67772756", "10667798", "208261807"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:79039732"}

Some topology improvements, are suggested. The proposed RTNN model is linear in small and nonlinear in large, which permits to apply all well known state- and output linear systems design methods. The obtained RTNN model is incorporated in a rule-based fuzzy system, giving the possibility to approximate and to identify a complex nonlinear plants. Simulation results of nonlinear systems identification by the proposed fuzzy-neural system, using RNN BP learning, are given.", "year": 1998, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/S1474-6670(17)42166-5", "venue": null, "journal": "IFAC Proceedings Volumes", "mag_id": "2617192599", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["11970419", "44213078", "6188086", "40271517", "55353359", "15597690", "17861493"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:126355338"}
