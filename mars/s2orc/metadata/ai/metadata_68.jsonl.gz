Text analysis or mining is enormously growing field for research simultaneously to artificial intelligence and data mining. Unstructured data or multimedia data is being constantly generated via social media Web sites, call center logs, blogs, and so on. Therefore, the explosion of textual data in a social media network is overwhelming. Text analysis or mining is widely being used to determine meaningful and noteworthy information for the huge amount of unstructured multimedia or heterogeneous data. In this paper, we compare the performance of text classification through support vector machine using multimedia data. This text analysis uses the technique of different fields like predict, machine learning, information, visualization, and natural language processing. The use of support vector machine for learning text nonlinear classifier is determined here. The reason for using SVM is that its performance is more accurate as compared to other soft computing tools and algorithms. In this paper, different kernel tricks have applied with nonlinear classifier for classification of text data mining. The results of proposed experiments predict that support vector machine with radial basis function achieves the highest overall accuracy.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-981-15-2774-6_33", "venue": "Advances in Intelligent Computing and Communication", "journal": "Advances in Intelligent Computing and Communication", "mag_id": "3000460101", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213343652"}

The current study aimed to explore a new method for discriminating attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients and control group by means of simultaneous measurement of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Twenty-three pre-medicated combined type ADHD children and 21 healthy children were included in the study. Nonlinear brain dynamics of subjects were obtained from EEG signal using Higuchi fractal dimensions and Lempel\u2013Ziv complexity, latency and amplitude values of P3 wave obtained from auditory evoked potentials and frontal cortex hemodynamic responses calculated from fNIRS. Lower complexity values, prolonged P3 latency and reduced P3 amplitude values were found in ADHD children. fNIRS indicated that the control subjects exhibited higher right prefrontal activation than ADHD children. Features are analyzed, looking for the best classification accuracy and finally machine learning techniques, namely Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes and Multilayer Perception Neural Network, are introduced for EEG signals alone and for combination of fNIRS and EEG signals.

The system works by utilizing frequency diversity and spatial diversity properties of CSI at target location by correlating the impact of human presence to certain changes on the received signal features. However, accurate modeling of the effect of a subject on fine grained CSI is challenging due to the presence of multipaths. We propose a novel subcarrier selection method to remove the multipath affected subcarriers to improve the performance of localization. We select the most location-dependent features from channel response based upon the wireless propagation model and propose to apply a machine learning based approach for location estimation, where the localization problem is shifted to a cell identification problem using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifier.

Methods which are dependent upon extensive laboratory testing are limited by the availability and integrity of the rock samples. Prediction of TOC (Total Organic Carbon) from well Log data being available for the majority of wells being drilled provides rapid evaluation of organic content, producing a continuous record while eliminating sampling issues. Therefore, the ideal method for determining the TOC fraction within source rock units would utilize common well log data. So a model was developed to formulate TOC values in the absence of laboratory TOC measurements from conventional well log data. Consequently, with the assistance of FL (Fuzzy Logic), TOC estimated from well log data with an overall prediction accuracy of 0.9425 for the test set. Following that TOC content of the Kazhdumi formation optimally has been divided into 4 zones using K-means cluster analysis, since searching for patterns is one of the main goals in data mining. There is a general increase in TOC from zone 1 to zone 4. The optimal number of zones has been detected by means of the knee method that finds the \u201cknee\u201d in a number of clusters vs. Compactness, Davies-Bouldin and Silhouette values. In the last step, using SVM (Support Vector Machine) and ANN (Artificial Neural Network) algorithms, two commonly used techniques, classification rules developed to predict the source rock class-membership (zones) from well log data. The proposed method is found effective in directly extracting patterns from well log data after defining classification rules. Quantitative comparisons of the results from ANN and SVM depicts that for classification problem of source rock zonation SVM with RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernel readily outperforms ANN in term of classification accuracy (0.9077 and 0.9369 for ANN and SVM, respectively), reduced computational time and highly repeatable results.

The LTS task remains challenging, particularly for languages with a complex relationship between spelling and pronunciation such as English. In this paper, we propose to use a conditional random field (CRF) to perform LTS because it avoids having to model a distribution over observations and can perform global inference, suggesting that it may be more suitable for LTS than decision trees, HMMs or JMMs. One challenge in applying CRFs to LTS is that the phoneme and grapheme sequences of a word are generally of different lengths, which makes CRF training difficult.

The proposed models for river flow include support vector regression (SVR), a hybrid of SVR with a fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) (so-called FOASVR), and an M5 model tree (M5). Additionally, the influence of periodicity (\u03c0) on the forecasting enactment was examined.

This often involves a large amount of computation, which makes diagnosis and prognosis difficult to implement, especially in embedded or mobile applications. To address this issue, this paper proposes a run-time Reconfigurable Computing (RC) system on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) for Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) to realize real-time Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation. The system leverages state-of-the-art run-time dynamic partial reconfiguration technology and customized computing circuits to balance the hardware occupation and computing efficiency. Optimal hardware resource consumption is achieved by partitioning the RVM algorithm according to a multi-objective optimization. Moreover, pipelined and parallel computation circuits for kernel function and matrix inverse are proposed on FPGA to further accelerate the computation. Experimental results with two different battery data sets show that, without sacrificing the RUL prediction performance, the embedded RC platform significantly reduces the computation time and the requirement of hardware resources.

It is used to determine the writer's attitude or speaker's opinion towards a particular person, product or topic. Polarity or subjectivity classification is the process of categorizing a piece of text into positive or negative classes. In recent years, various supervised and unsupervised methods have been presented to accomplish sentiment polarity detection. SentiWordNet (SWN) has been extensively used as a lexical resource for opinion mining. This research incorporates SWN as the labeled training corpus where the sentiment scores are extracted based on the part of speech information. A vocabulary SWN-V with revised sentiment scores, generated from SWN, is then used for Support Vector Machines model learning and classification process. Based on this vocabulary, a framework named \u201cEnhanced Sentiment Analysis and Polarity Classification (eSAP)\u201d is proposed. Training, testing and evaluation of the proposed eSAP are conducted on seven benchmark datasets from various domains. 10-fold cross validated accuracy, precision, recall, and f-measure results averaged over seven datasets for the proposed framework are 80.82%, 80.83%, 80.94% and 80.81% respectively. A notable performance improvement of 13.4% in accuracy, 14.2% in precision, 6.9% in recall and 11.1% in f-measure is observed on average by evaluating the proposed eSAP against the baseline SWN classifier.

Most existing calligraphy robots focus on enabling the robots to learn writing through human participation, such as human-robot interactions and manually designed evaluation functions. However, because of the subjectivity of art aesthetics, these existing methods require a large amount of implementation work from human engineers. In addition, the written results cannot be accurately evaluated. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose a robotic calligraphy model that combines a generative adversarial network (GAN) and deep reinforcement learning to enable a calligraphy robot to learn to write Chinese character strokes directly from images captured from Chinese calligraphic textbooks. In our proposed model, to automatically establish an aesthetic evaluation system for Chinese calligraphy, a GAN is first trained to understand and reconstruct stroke images. Then, the discriminator network is independently extracted from the trained GAN and embedded into a variant of the reinforcement learning method, the \u201cactor-critic model\u201d, as a reward function. Thus, a calligraphy robot adopts the improved actor-critic model to learn to write multiple character strokes. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model successfully allows a calligraphy robot to write Chinese character strokes based on input stroke images. The performance of our model, compared with the state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning method, shows the efficacy of the combination approach. In addition, the key technology in this work shows promise as a solution for robotic autonomous assembly.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2020.01.043", "venue": null, "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "2999783109", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213554963"}

In particular, we propose novel solutions to the following challenges: (1) robust and computationally efficient modeling and classification of the changing appearance of the speakers in a variety of different lighting conditions and camera resolutions; (2) dealing with full or partial occlusions when multiple speakers cross or come into very close proximity; (3) automatic initialization of the trackers, or re-initialization when the trackers have lost lock caused by e.g. the limited camera views. First, we develop new algorithms for appearance modeling of the moving speakers based on dictionary learning (DL), using an off-line training process. In the tracking phase, the histograms (coding coefficients) of the image patches derived from the learned dictionaries are used to generate the likelihood functions based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification. This likelihood function is then used in the measurement step of the classical particle filtering (PF) algorithm. To improve the computational efficiency of generating the histograms, a soft voting technique based on approximate Locality-constrained Soft Assignment (LcSA) is proposed to reduce the number of dictionary atoms (codewords) used for histogram encoding. Second, an adaptive identity model is proposed to track multiple speakers whilst dealing with occlusions. This model is updated online using Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) adaptation, where we control the adaptation rate using the spatial relationship between the subjects. Third, to enable automatic initialization of the visual trackers, we exploit audio information, the Direction of Arrival (DOA) angle, derived from microphone array recordings. Such information provides, a priori, the number of speakers and constrains the search space for the speaker's faces.

However textural features may not be enough to describe properties of an image. Deep features are an emerging source of features that can combat the weaknesses of textural features. The goal of this study is to propose a lung disease classification framework using deep features from five different deep networks and comparing its results with the conventional Gray-level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). This study used a dataset of 81 diseased and 15 normal patients with five levels of High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) slices. A comparison of five different deep learning networks namely, Alexnet, VGG16, VGG19, Res50 and Res101, with textural features from Gray-level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) was performed. This study used a K-fold validation protocol with K= 2, 3, 5 and 10. This study also compared using five classifiers; Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Regression and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers. The usage of PCA increased the classification accuracy from 92.01% to 97.40% when using k-NN classifier. This was achieved with only using 14 features instead of the initial 1000 features. Using SVM classifier, a maximum accuracy of 100% was achieved when using all five of the deep learning features.

Thesis: MScEng (E & E) December 2014 The increasing popularity of microblogging services such as Twitter means that more and more unstructured data is available for analysis. The informal language usage in these media presents a problem for traditional text mining and natural language processing tools. We develop a pre-processor to normalise this noisy text so that useful information can be extracted with standard tools. A system consisting of a tokeniser, out-of-vocabulary token identifier, correct candidate generator, and N-gram language model is proposed. We compare the performance of generative and discriminative probabilistic models for these different modules. The effect of normalising the training and testing data on the performance of a tweet sentiment classifier is investigated. A linear-chain conditional random field, which is a discriminative model, is found to work better than its generative counterpart for the tokenisation module, achieving a 0.76% character error rate compared to 1.41% for the finite state automaton. For the candidate generation module, however, the generative weighted finite state transducer works better, getting the correct clean version of a word right 36% of the time on the first guess, while the discriminatively trained hidden alignment conditional random field only achieves 6%. The use of a normaliser as a pre-processing step does not significantly affect the performance of the sentiment classifier. ii Stellenbosch University http://scholar.sun.ac.za", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2151676519", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61776334"}

As the rents/returns of bikes at different stations in different periods are unbalanced, the bikes in a system need to be rebalanced frequently.

In this paper, we propose a hierarchical prediction model to predict the number of bikes that will be rent from/returned to each station cluster in a future period so that reallocation can be executed in advance. We first propose a bipartite clustering algorithm to cluster bike stations into groups, formulating a two-level hierarchy of stations. The total number of bikes that will be rent in a city is predicted by a Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT). Then a multi-similarity-based inference model is proposed to predict the rent proportion across clusters and the inter-cluster transition, based on which the number of bikes rent from/ returned to each cluster can be easily inferred.

Hence, it is essential to develop a credible approach to estimate forest biomass and carbon stocks. Our study applied Sentinel-2 satellite imagery combined with field-measured biomass using Random Forest (RF), a machine learning regression algorithm, to estimate forest aboveground biomass (AGB) in Yok Don National Park, Vietnam. A total of 132 spectral and texture variables were extracted from Sentinel-2 imagery (February 7, 2017) to predict AGB of the National Park using RF algorithm. It was found that a combination of 132 spectral and texture variables could predict AGB with an R2 value of 0.94, RMSE of 34.5 Mgha\u22121 and %RMSE of 18.3%. RF regression algorithm was further used to reduce the number of variables in such a way that a minimum number of selected variables can be able to estimate AGB at a satisfactory level. A combination of 11 spectral and texture variables was identified based on out-of-bag (OOB) estimation to develop an easy-to-use model for estimating AGB. On validation, the model developed with 11 variables was able to predict AGB with R2 = 0.81, RMSE = 36.67 Mg ha\u22121 and %RMSE of 19.55%.

NILM is unidentifiable and thus a challenge problem because the inferred power value of an appliance given only the mains could not be unique. To mitigate the unidentifiable problem, various methods incorporating domain knowledge into NILM have been proposed and shown effective experimentally. Recently, among these methods, deep neural networks are shown performing best. Arguably, the recently proposed sequence-to-point (seq2point) learning is promising for NILM. However, the results were only carried out on the same data domain. It is not clear if the method could be generalised or transferred to different domains, e.g., the test data were drawn from a different country comparing to the training data. We address this issue in the paper, and two transfer learning schemes are proposed, i.e., appliance transfer learning (ATL) and cross-domain transfer learning (CTL). For ATL, our results show that the latent features learnt by a `complex' appliance, e.g., washing machine, can be transferred to a `simple' appliance, e.g., kettle. For CTL, our conclusion is that the seq2point learning is transferable. Precisely, when the training and test data are in a similar domain, seq2point learning can be directly applied to the test data without fine tuning; when the training and test data are in different domains, seq2point learning needs fine tuning before applying to the test data.

M.", "middle": [], "last": "Jonathan Wu", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Designing a completely automatic and efficient face recognition system is a grand challenge for biometrics, computer vision and pattern recognition researchers. Generally, such a recognition system is able to perform three subtasks: face detection, feature extraction and classification. We\u2019ll put our focus on feature extraction, the crucial step prior to classification. The key issue here is to construct a representative feature set that can enhance system-performance both in terms of accuracy and speed. At the core of machine recognition of human faces is the extraction of proper features. Direct use of pixel values as features is not possible due to huge dimensionality of the faces. Traditionally, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed to obtain a lower dimensional representation of the data in the standard eigenface based methods [Turk and Pentland 1991]. Though this approach is useful, it suffers from high computational load and fails to well-reflect the correlation of facial features. The modern trend is to perform multiresolution analysis of images. This way, several problems like, deformation of images due to in-plane rotation, illumination variation and expression changes can be handled with less difficulty. Multiresolution ideas have been widely used in the field of face recognition. The most popular multiresolution analysis tool is the Wavelet Transform. In wavelet analysis an image is usually decomposed at different scales and orientations using a wavelet basis vector. Thereafter, the component corresponding to maximum variance is subjected to \u2018further operation\u2019. Often this \u2018further operation\u2019 includes some dimension reduction before feeding the coefficients to classifiers like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN) and Nearest Neighbor. This way, a compact representation of the facial images can be achieved and the effect of variable facial appearances on the classification systems can also be reduced. The wide-spread popularity of wavelets has stirred researchers\u2019 interest in multiresolution and harmonic analysis. Following the success of wavelets, a series of multiresolution, multidimensional tools, namely contourlet, curvelet, ridgelet have been developed in the past few years. In this chapter, we\u2019ll concentrate on Digital Curvelet Transform. First, the theory of curvelet transform will be discussed in brief. Then we'll talk about the potential of curvelets as a feature descriptor, looking particularly into the problem of image-based face recognition.

It is important to design robust and reliable emotion recognition systems that are suitable for real-world applications both to enhance analytical abilities to support human decision making and to design human-machine interfaces that facilitate efficient communication. We introduce a hierarchical computational structure to recognize emotions. The proposed structure maps an input speech utterance into one of the multiple emotion classes through subsequent layers of binary classifications. The key idea is that the levels in the tree are designed to solve the easiest classification tasks first, allowing us to mitigate error propagation. We evaluated the classification framework on two different emotional databases using acoustic features, the AIBO database and the USC IEMOCAP database. In the case of the AIBO database, we obtain a balanced recall on each of the individual emotion classes using this hierarchical structure. The performance measure of the average unweighted recall on the evaluation data set improves by 3.37% absolute (8.82% relative) over a Support Vector Machine baseline model. In the USC IEMOCAP database, we obtain an absolute improvement of 7.44% (14.58%) over a baseline Support Vector Machine modeling.

To this end, integrating demand-side flexible resources into electricity markets is a significant trend for smart energy systems. The continuous double auction (CDA) market is viewed as a promising P2P (peer to peer) market mechanism to enable interactions among demand side prosumers and consumers in distribution grids. To achieve optimal operations and maximize profits, prosumers in the electricity market must act as price makers to simultaneously optimize their operations and trading strategies. However, the CDA-based market is difficult to model explicitly because of its information-based clearing mechanism and the stochastic bidding behaviors of its participants. To facilitate prosumers actively participating in the CDA market, this paper proposes a novel prediction-integration strategy optimization (PISO) model. A surrogate market prediction model based on Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is developed, which learns the interaction relationship between prosumer bidding actions and market responses from historical transaction data. Moreover, the prediction model can be conveniently transformed and integrated into the prosumer operation optimization model in the form of constraints. Therefore, prosumer operations and market trading strategies can be jointly optimized through the proposed approach, facilitating the integration of flexible resources into electricity markets. Numerical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model by comparing with existing CDA trading strategies under various market conditions.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.03.094", "venue": null, "journal": "Applied Energy", "mag_id": "2942921011", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["210974882", "210839301", "204970736", "211030085"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:155740747"}

Diverse derived image features were fed to the Support Vector Machines classifier to create land cover maps, followed by a validation procedure using field samples and reference data. Land cover maps showed an increase in forest area from 37.32% (1993) to 39.26% (2018) and snow & glaciers from 1.72% (1993) to 2.15% (2018) while a decrease in grassland area from 38.78% (1993) to 36.41% (2018) and agriculture & built-up area from 2.39% (1993) to 1.80% (2018). Barren land and water body showed negligible changes. The spatial explicit process of forest fragmentation indicated that shrinkage was the most responsible factor of forest loss while expansion was dominant to increment for forest restoration. High dependency of people persists on the reserve for subsistence resources being a cause of forest fragmentation and posing threats to biodiversity. Focus should be made on strategies to decrease the anthropogenic pressure on the reserve. This requires approaches that provide sustainable alternative resources to the local people and innovations that will help them become less reliant on natural resources.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1101/846741", "venue": null, "journal": "bioRxiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2989300566", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["683666", "86391435", "85615524", "56343936", "85347943", "9498548", "85326629", "12840436", "55000399", "134382421", "21843346", "21889959", "130875651", "25575490", "89772810", "94780220", "125010141", "44707160", "128075088", "152345056"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209565927"}

Due to the synchronized activity of large group of neurons, epileptic seizures occur. These epileptic seizures cause numerous changes in the behaviour and perception of the patient. Even if the epileptic seizures are quite rare in a given patient, the fear of the occurrence of next seizure and helplessness feeling will have a very strong influence on the daily life of a patient. To improve the quality of life of these epileptic patients, a systematic method to predict the occurrence of seizures should be reliable. In biomedical science, EEG signals provide very valid contributions and hence the careful analysis of EEG recordings is required to understand the valuable information. To capture the brain signals of the epileptic patient, Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used. EEG has a good temporal resolution and is non invasive in nature with a low maintenance cost. Since the EEG recordings are too huge to process, certain form of dimensionality reduction technique is required to reduce the dimensions of the EEG data in order to process the data.

The IPE-ELM algorithm combines the evolutionary genetic algorithms (for feature selection), ELM machine learning technique (for prediction accuracy calculation), parallel computation (for faster fitness evaluation), and parameter tuning (activation function selection and the number of hidden neurons) for the solution of this important problem. Each ELM that runs at a different processor selects one of four different activation functions (Sine, Cosine, Sigmoid and Hyperbolic Tangent) and uses a randomized number of hidden neurons to achieve higher prediction accuracy. The proposed algorithm provides high quality results with its (near)-linear scalability behavior. The IPE-ELM algorithm is compared with state-of-the-art data classification algorithms by using UCI benchmark datasets and significant improvements are reported in terms of prediction accuracy with reasonable execution times.

Connectionist models of recursive syntax typically use \u201ctoy\u201d fragments of grammar and small vocabularies. Aside from raising concerns over scalingup, this makes it difficult to provide detailed fits with empirical data. Nonetheless, some attempts have recently been made toward fitting existing data and deriving new empirical predictions from the models. For example, the Christiansen and Chater (1999) SRN model fits grammaticality ratings data from several behavioral experiments, including an account of the relative processing difficulty associated with the processing center-embeddings (with the following relationship between nouns and verbs: N1N2N3V3V2V1) vs. cross-dependencies (with the following relationship between nouns and verbs: N1N2N3V1V2V3). Human data have shown that sentences with two centerembeddings (in German) were significantly harder to process than comparable sentences with two cross-dependencies (in Dutch). The simulation results demonstrated that the SRNs exhibited the same kind of qualitative processing difficulties as humans on these two types of complex recursive constructions. Just as the radical connectionist approach to constituency deviates from classical constituency, the above approach to recursion deviates from the classical notion of recursion. The radical models of recursion do not acquire \u201ctrue\u201d recursion because they are unable to process infinitely complex recursive constructions. However, the classic notion of recursion may be illsuited for capturing human recursive abilities. Indeed, the psycholinguistic data suggest that people\u2019s performance may be better construed as being only \u201cquasi-recursive\u201d. The earlier mentioned semantic facilitation of recursive processing further suggests that human recursive performance may be partially context-sensitive; for example, the semantically biased \u2018The bees that the hive that the farmer built housed stung the children\u2019 is easier to comprehend than neutral \u2018The chef that the waiter that the busboy offended appreciated admired the musicians\u2019 even though both sentences contain two center-embeddings. This dovetails with the context-sensitive notion of constituency, and suggests that context-sensitivity may be a more pervasive feature of language processing than typically assumed by symbolic approaches.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2259410644", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9338841", "9640291", "2763403", "7069311", "62386308", "59852381", "195711316", "195914990", "15767019"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16936974"}

Promoters lie in tightly constrained positions relative to the transcription start site (TSS). In this paper, we address the problem of predicting transcription start sites in Escherichia coli.

The accepted method for promoter prediction is to use a pair of position weight matrices (PWMs), which define conserved motifs at the sigma-factor binding site. However this method is known to result in a large number of false positive predictions, thereby limiting its usefulness to the experimental biologist. We adopt an alternative approach based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) using a modified mismatch spectrum kernel. Our modifications involve tagging the motifs with their location, and selectively pruning the feature set. We quantify the performance of several SVM models and a PWM model using a performance metric of area under the detection-error tradeoff (DET) curve.

To address this problem, we present a proactive recommender system that generates real time recommendations using the proposed Extreme Learning Machine based Imputation-Boosted Collaborative Filtering (ELMICF) algorithm. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a machine learning algorithm which considerably reduces the time required for training the system due to the very fast learning process of ELM. It has been used in literature for numerous classification, generalization and prediction applications. ELMICF first employs an imputation technique to handle data sparseness in the input rating matrix and then uses the ELM as a classifier to predict the novel ratings. A prototype of the system has been implemented for restaurant recommendations to show the feasibility of our proposed approach.

In most cases, SRM is accomplished by using the spatial dependence principle, which is a simple method to describe the spatial patterns of different land cover classes. However, the spatial dependence principle used in existing SRM models does not fully reflect the real-world situations, making the resultant fine resolution land cover map often have uncertainty. In this paper, an example-based SRM model using support vector regression (SVR_SRM) was proposed. Without directly using an explicit formulation to describe the prior information about the subpixel spatial pattern, SVR_SRM generates a fine resolution land cover map from coarse fractional images, by learning the nonlinear relationships between the coarse fractional pixels and corresponding labeled subpixels from the selected best-match training data. Based on the experiments of two subset images of National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2001 and a subset of real hyperspectral Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) image, the performance of SVR_SRM was evaluated by comparing with the traditional pixel-based hard classification (HC) and several existing typical SRM algorithms.

This paper uses error correcting codes for multilabel classification. BCH code and Random Forests learner are used to form the proposed method. Thus, the advantage of the error-correcting properties of BCH is merged with the good performance of the random forests learner to enhance the multilabel classification results. Three experiments are conducted on three common benchmark datasets. The results are compared against those of several exiting approaches. The proposed method does well against its counterparts for the three datasets of varying characteristics. positive relevance classification is associated with the instance. Zhang and Zhou (3) report a multi-label lazy learning approach which is derived from the traditional k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) and named ML-kNN. For each unseen instance, its k nearest neighbors in the training set are identified. Then, based on statistical information gained from the label sets of these neighboring instances, maximum a posteriori principle is used to determine the label set for the unseen instance. Zhang and Zhou (4) present a neural network-based algorithm that is Backpropagation for Multi-Label Learning named BP-MLL. It is based on the backpropagation algorithm but uses a specific error function that captures the characteristics of multi-label learning. The labels belonging to an instance are ranked higher than those not belonging to that instance. Tsoumakas and Vlahavas (5) propose RAndom K- labELsets (RAKEL) which is an ensemble method for multilabel classification based on random projections of the label space. An ensemble of Label Powerset (LP) classifiers is trained on smaller size of label subset randomly selected from the training data. The RAKEL takes into account label correlations by using single- label classifiers that are applied on subtasks with manageable number of labels and adequate number of examples per label.

Eighteen orogenic gold deposits in this district and associated regional exploration datasets were used to construct data-driven predictive models to identify locations prospective for gold mineralization. The 18 orogenic gold deposits used in the modeling can be divided into magmatic-hydrothermal gold deposits and mesothermal gold deposits in terms of metallogenic characteristics and nine evidential maps associated with Au deposit occurrences (i.e., distance to intrusions and faults; Au, As, Ag, Cu, and Sb singularity indices; and principal component scores (PC1 and PC2) based on isometric logratio-transformed geochemical data were selected as inputs to the models). The PC1 represents a primary geochemical signature of tectonic process or their products (i.e., fault system), whereas PC2 represents a secondary geochemical signature. Both RF and MaxEnt models were then used to quantitatively rank the importance and identify the sensitivity of the evidential maps based on their spatial relationships to the known gold deposits in the study area. The two groups of populations in the response curves and marginal effect curves indicate that the mineral potential mapping should be performed by zones in consideration of different metallogenic characteristics of gold deposits. The accuracy of the resulting models was then assessed, and the results of the mineral potential mapping were examined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, capture-efficiency curve, and success rate curve. Both mineral potential mapping by zones with RF and MaxEnt models have higher area under the ROC curve (AUC) values than the models performed in the study area and delineate 19% of the study area containing > 88% of the known deposit occurrences. Finally, according to the concentration\u2013area (C-A) thresholds for prospectivity maps, two ternary prospectivity maps were generated for further mineral exploration.

The accurate permeability mapping, even with the aid of modern borehole geophysics methods, is still a big challenge on the reservoir management framework. One concern within the petrophysics community is that rock permeability value predicted by well logging should not be considered as absolute, mainly for carbonates, but a relative index for identifying more permeable zones. Therefore, in this paper a permeability classification methodology, based exclusively on 1H NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) relaxation data, was evaluated for the first time as an alternative to the prediction of permeability as a continuous variable. To pursue this, a side-by-side comparison of different data mining techniques for the permeability classification task was performed using a petrophysical dataset with 78 rock samples from six different carbonate reservoirs. The effectiveness of six classification algorithms (k-NN, Naive Bayes, C4.5, SMO, Random Forest and Multilayer Perceptron) was evaluated to predict the rock permeability class according to the following ranges: low ( 100mD).

Recently, neural network-based models have attained superior performance in solving the in-domain CWS task. Last year, Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT), a new language representation model, has been proposed as a backbone model for many natural language tasks and redefined the corresponding performance. The excellent performance of BERT motivates us to apply it to solve the CWS task. By conducting intensive experiments in the benchmark datasets from the second International Chinese Word Segmentation Bake-off, we obtain several keen observations. BERT can slightly improve the performance even when the datasets contain the issue of labeling inconsistency. When applying sufficiently learned features, Softmax, a simpler classifier, can attain the same performance as that of a more complicated classifier, e.g., Conditional Random Field (CRF). The performance of BERT usually increases as the model size increases. The features extracted by BERT can be also applied as good candidates for other neural network models.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1909.09292", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2974447665", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["14724419", "17268102", "6803340", "5816303", "52271711", "52967399", "1654945", "6628106", "2858778", "52046908", "2303379", "49313245", "13756489", "3603249", "61173622", "36997937", "8064538", "6866988"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202712807"}

After automated discrimination of nuclei from other objects (i.e., debris, clusters, etc.), a nuclei classifier was trained to discriminate abnormal nuclei (8,841) from normal nuclei (5,762).

The multifocal learning problem is motivated by numerous real-world learning applications. For instance, for the same type of problems encountered in a customer service center, the problem descriptions from different customers can be quite different. Experienced customers usually give more precise and focused descriptions about the problem. In contrast, inexperienced customers usually provide diverse descriptions. In this case, the examples from the same class in the training data can be naturally in different focal groups. Therefore, it is necessary to identify those natural focal groups and exploit them for learning at different focuses. Along this line, the key development challenge is how to identify those focal groups in the training data. As a case study, we exploit multifocal learning for profiling customer problems. Also, we provide an empirical study about how the performance of multifocal learning is affected by the quality of focal groups. The results on real-world customer problem logs show that multifocal learning can significantly boost the performance of many existing classification algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), for classifying customer problems and there is strong correlation between the quality of focal groups and the learning performance.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/1961189.1961196", "venue": "TIST", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1971165270", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1450247", "1639154", "831781", "14229502", "6492502", "2175414", "2873315", "14353019", "18600000", "2909742", "14578607", "17583498", "198473184", "110298577", "154498274", "56509683", "8432570", "14516773", "6395026", "10079637"], "inbound_citations": ["16200514"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17936097"}

It is an analysis of a sentence which identifies the constituents (noun groups, verb groups, prepositional groups), but does not specify their internal structure, nor their role in the main sentence. The only technique used for Arabic shallow parser is Support Vector Machine (SVM) based approach. The problem faced by shallow parser developers is the boundary identification which is applied to ensure the generation of high accuracy system performance. Approach: The specific objective of the research was to identify the entire Noun Phrases (NPs), Verb Phrases (VPs) and Prepositional Phrases (PPs) boundaries in the Arabic language. This study discussed various idiosyncrasies of Arabic sentences to derive more accurate rules to detect start and the end boundaries of each clause in an Arabic sentence. New rules were proposed to the shallow parser features up to the generation of two levels from full parse-tree. We described an implementation and evaluate the rule-based shallow parser that handles chunking of Arabic sentences. This research was based on a critical analysis of the Arabic sentences architecture. It discussed various idiosyncrasies of Arabic sentences to derive more accurate rules to detect the start and the end boundaries of each clause in an Arabic sentence. Results: The system was tested manually on 70 Arabic sentences which composed of 1776 words, with the length of the sentences between 4-50 words. The result obtained was significantly better than state of the art Arabic published results, which achieved F-scores of 97%.

In this paper, we propose a residual dilated convolutional neural network with the conditional random field (RD-CNN-CRF) for the Chinese CNER, which makes the model asynchronous in computation and thus speeding up the training period dramatically. To be more specific, Chinese characters and dictionary features are first projected into dense vector representations, then they are fed into the residual dilated convolutional neural network to capture contextual features. Finally, a conditional random field is employed to capture dependencies between neighboring tags and obtain the optimal tag sequence for the entire sequence.

Deep learning of the Kd-network was trained with classical three-dimensional (3D) point cloud datasets (PCD) of the ShapeNet datasets. After a series of processes of PCD sensed by the light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor, the cattle silhouettes could be extracted, which after augmentation could be applied as an input layer to the Kd-network.

The TrAdaBoost algorithm was employed to transfer the pre-trained convolutional layer and full connection of the deep model. To classify and recognize the PCD of the cattle silhouette, the average accuracy rate after training with transfer learning could reach up to 93.6%.

After the computation of the FPFH (fast point feature histogram) of the surface shape, the center of the feature surface could be recognized and the body dimensions of the cattle could finally be calculated.

Most existing network representation learning methods mainly focus on static networks, which extract and condense the network information without temporal information.

But it is difficult to quantify the evolution of node structure in dynamic networks. To address this problem, we propose a dynamic network representation learning method, call it as RWR-STNE. The proposed framework makes use of structural properties of networks at current and previous timestamps to learn effective node representations. This method first utilizes the historical information obtained from the network snapshots at past timestamps to create a spatial-temporal trajectory graph. Then it uses random walks with restart on the graph at a given timestamp as well as on graphs from past timestamps to capture the spatial-temporal behavior of nodes. The experiments on three real-world temporal network datasets show that the proposed learning method is valid.

This, in turn, would successfully influence the life expectancy of the patients.

Named entity recognition of well-defined objects, such as genes or proteins, has achieved a sufficient level of maturity such that it can form the basis for the next step: the extraction of relations that exist between the recognized entities. Whereas most early work focused on the mere detection of relations, the classification of the type of relation is also of great importance and this is the focus of this work. In this paper we describe an approach that extracts both the existence of a relation and its type. Our work is based on Conditional Random Fields, which have been applied with much success to the task of named entity recognition.ResultsWe benchmark our approach on two different tasks. The first task is the identification of semantic relations between diseases and treatments. The available data set consists of manually annotated PubMed abstracts. The second task is the identification of relations between genes and diseases from a set of concise phrases, so-called GeneRIF (Gene Reference Into Function) phrases. In our experimental setting, we do not assume that the entities are given, as is often the case in previous relation extraction work. Rather the extraction of the entities is solved as a subproblem. Compared with other state-of-the-art approaches, we achieve very competitive results on both data sets. To demonstrate the scalability of our solution, we apply our approach to the complete human GeneRIF database. The resulting gene-disease network contains 34758 semantic associations between 4939 genes and 1745 diseases. The gene-disease network is publicly available as a machine-readable RDF graph.ConclusionWe extend the framework of Conditional Random Fields towards the annotation of semantic relations from text and apply it to the biomedical domain. Our approach is based on a rich set of textual features and achieves a performance that is competitive to leading approaches. The model is quite general and can be extended to handle arbitrary biological entities and relation types. The resulting gene-disease network shows that the GeneRIF database provides a rich knowledge source for text mining. Current work is focused on improving the accuracy of detection of entities as well as entity boundaries, which will also greatly improve the relation extraction performance.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2386138", "pubmed_id": "18433469", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-9-207", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2036935277", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["37240187", "18069921", "12012397", "270818", "161340", "311673", "16898966", "22777446", "6922775", "5511339", "12880854", "10070483", "13225477", "902226", "2591187", "14289503", "14767121", "14067186", "14187105", "205228801", "94040", "14566859", "14179309", "961425", "10950726", "7380336", "288484", "5559939", "12326709", "6159009", "38476", "277918", "59921147", "12943282", "5273348", "9215625"], "inbound_citations": ["102352345", "7842994", "53382837", "210992882", "13861904", "15109503", "17679376", "135464297", "3129226", "8004603", "17682075", "13388188", "16893368", "215217105", "146120993", "12905781", "4434827", "7921122", "550589", "3065240", "3852572", "7233580", "17853683", "208168733", "2454068", "40926166", "7630912", "12446359", "17753432", "209491607", "5637863", "18198817", "10274390", "208883300", "4713937", "18266673", "60357255", "2956323", "73729237", "135614", "19008974", "8947425", "5871627", "17226484", "5666581", "18709434", "13205080", "14943450", "10021867", "1751478", "5155707", "14568267", "28026237", "9310851", "10559990", "2584347", "21919976", "16742511", "3698939", "16721936", "52964067", "26328026", "4352217", "16548646", "4002987", "1900281", "740323", "14329", "215443130", "14034645", "88007468", "7530878", "73568734", "52186357", "53913152", "1829980", "202760059", "5978918", "24891385", "8884564", "202541049", "49654657", "12733482", "10769782", "1731876", "14977958", "16359380", "1727477", "15279105", "33484963", "8152420", "215043749", "4034248", "206917159", "204247252", "6765130", "20720118", "588673", "16819046", "1978050", "10966313", "10036836", "49405128", "1561128", "6577783", "17433859", "12407180", "17181905", "3204265", "40892884", "215666068", "92158280", "11250154", "195190740", "9924032", "56356064", "17644708", "29134733", "10788006", "16951375", "2202167", "38039519", "7427287", "158992986", "7415037", "58951468", "207056978", "51772482", "17869094", "16119529", "2118867", "16865324", "202159601", "2953807", "4724962", "201114827", "16311265", "55391848"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11473206"}

The scanned image is segmented into paragraphs using spatial space detection technique, paragraphs into lines using vertical histogram, lines into words using horizontal histogram, and words into character image glyphs using horizontal histogram. The extracted features considered for recognition are given to Support Vector Machine, Self Organizing Map, RCS, Fuzzy Neural Network and Radial Basis Network. Where the characters are classified using supervised learning algorithm. These classes are mapped onto Unicode for recognition. Then the text is reconstructed using Unicode fonts. This character recognition finds applications in document analysis where the handwritten document can be converted to editable printed document. This approach can be extended to recognition and reproduction of hand written documents in South Indian languages. In the training set, a recognition rate of 100% was achieved and in the test set the recognized speed for each character is 0.1sec and accuracy is 97%. Understandably, the training set produced much higher recognition rate than the test set. Structure analysis suggested that the proposed system of RCS with back propagation network is given higher recognition rate. Handwritten character recognition is a difficult problem due to the great variations of writing styles, different size and orientation angle of the characters. Among different branches of handwritten character recognition it is easier to recognize English alphabets and numerals than Tamil characters. Many researchers have also applied the excellent generalization capabilities offered by ANNs to the recognition of characters. Many studies have used fourier descriptors and Back Propagation Networks for classification tasks. Fourier descriptors were used in to recognize handwritten numerals. Neural Network approaches were used to classify tools. There have been only a few attempts in the past to address the recognition of printed or handwritten Tamil Characters. However, less attention had been given to Indian language recognition.

Accurate estimations of changes in aboveground biomass are critical for understanding forest carbon cycling and promoting climate change mitigation. Southwest China is characterized by complex topographic features and forest canopy structures, complicating methods for mapping aboveground biomass and its dynamics. The integration of continuous Landsat images and national forest inventory data provides an alternative approach to develop a long-term monitoring program of forest aboveground biomass dynamics. This study explores the development of a methodological framework using historical national forest inventory plot data and Landsat TM time-series images. This method was formulated by comparing two parametric methods: Linear Regression for Multiple Independent Variables (MLR), and Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR); and two nonparametric methods: Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boost Regression Tree (GBRT) based on the state of forest aboveground biomass and change models. The methodological framework mapped Pinus densata aboveground biomass and its changes over time in Shangri-la, Yunnan, China. Landsat images and national forest inventory data were acquired for 1987, 1992, 1997, 2002 and 2007. The results show that: (1) correlation and homogeneity texture measures were able to characterize forest canopy structures, aboveground biomass and its dynamics; (2) GBRT and RF predicted Pinus densata aboveground biomass and its changes better than PLSR and MLR; (3) GBRT was the most reliable approach in the estimation of aboveground biomass and its changes; and, (4) the aboveground biomass change models showed a promising improvement of prediction accuracy.

The Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach is adopted as the inference model to predict friendship based on a variety of features extracted from the mobile phone data, including proximity, outgoing calls, outgoing text messages, incoming calls, and incoming text messages. Third, we demonstrate the social relation evolution process by using the social balance theory. For the friendship prediction, we achieved an overall recognition rate of 97.0 % by number and a class average accuracy of 89.8 %.

Developing a fast and accurate method to predict the protein properties based on the primary sequences becomes indispensable. In general, the performance of the predictive system can be improved by selecting appropriate algorithm and the fitting method of extracting feature. Thus a new method of extracting feature (the weighting pseudo\u2013amino acid composition) from the sequences has been introduced to predict the protein homo\u2013oligomers, which is a combination of a set of weighting discrete sequence correlation factors computed with the amino acid index profile and the 20 components of the conventional amino acid composition. We extract four attribute parameter datasets (COMP, PLIV, FAUJ and MAXF) from the primary sequences as examples to investigate this problem. The COMP attribute dataset is composed of amino acid composition, and the PLIV, FAUJ and MAXF attribute datasets are composed of the amino acid composition and a set of weighting discrete sequence correlation factors of corresponding amino acid residue index. The total accuracies of PLIV, FAUJ and MAXF using support vector machines (SVM) algorithm are 80.36%, 79.34% and 79.02% respectively in 10 fold cross\u2013validation (10CV) test, which are 4.59%, 3.57% and 3.25% respectively higher than that of COMP. Based on the same COMP and PLIV attribute datasets, the total accuracies of SVM are 33.87% and 18.05% respectively higher than that of covariant discriminant algorithm in the jackknife test. These results show that the method of extracting feature from the protein sequences is effective and feasible for predicting homo\u2013oligomers, and implies that the primary sequences of homo\u2013oligomeric proteins contain quaternary structure information, and also indicates that the performance of SVM is superior to the covariant discriminant algorithm for classifying protein homo\u2013oligomers.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2553792796", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["22216478", "10151090", "18946808", "44744630", "14468648", "36534080", "1026081", "18648022", "2698102", "2154417", "3573986", "7943197", "23081257", "59683836", "20682399", "25288494", "28248657", "92574150", "7270093", "12946615"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18549141"}

Active learning would be a suitable approach to minimize the effort of annotation. A novel active learning approach, coupled K nearest neighbor pseudo pruning (CKNNPP), is proposed in the paper, which is based on querying examples by KNNPP method. The KNNPP method applies k nearest neighbor technique to search for k neighbor samples from labeled samples of unlabeled samples. When k labeled samples are not belong to the same class, the corresponded unlabeled sample is queried and given its right label by supervisor, and then it is added to labeled training set. In contrast with the previous depiction, the unlabeled sample is not selected and pruned, that is the pseudo pruning. This definition is enlightened from the K nearest neighbor pruning preprocessing. These samples selected by KNNPP are considered to be near or on the optimal classification hyperplane that is crucial for active learning. Especially, in order to avoid the excursion of the optimal classification hyperplane after adding a queried sample, CKNNPP method is proposed finally that two samples with different class label (like a couple, annotated by supervisor) are queried by KNNPP and added in the training set simultaneously for updating training set in each iteration. The CKNNPP can provide a good performance, and especially it is simple, effective, and robust, and can solve the classification problem with unbalanced dataset compared with the existing methods. Then, the computational complexity of CKNNPP is analyzed.

Biometric systems plays a significant role in personal, national, and global security.

Moreover, classification of user\u2019s question is a herculean task based on the tractability that natural language (NL) affords with different forms. The information enshrined in a group of words is not sufficient to effectively classify the question in the quote. Until now, few reports have focused on QC for Arabic Language question answering (QA). The earlier report has employed the technique of handcrafted rules and keyword matching for QC. Nonetheless, these procedures are considered obsolete in terms of applying it to new territories. In this paper, we present a question-answering system combining aims on a combination of model fixed on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and pattern-based Matching techniques for Arabic Language question classification (ALQC). The Islamic Hadith purview on QA in the study was focusing on the effect of a feature set on the performance of SVM for QC. About five patterns were employed in the analysis together with the classification of three types of questions, namely \u201cWho\u201d, \u201cWhere\u201d and \u201cWhat\u201d.

We sought to study these features of the macrophage genome by the combination of experimental (ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and GRO-seq) and computational approaches. We show that Random Forest and Support Vector Regression machine learning methods can accurately predict chromatin accessibility using the binding patterns of the LDTF PU.1 and four other key TFs of macrophages (IRF8, JUNB, CEBPA and RUNX1).

Existing methods often do not consider different granularity in visual similarity. However, in many domain applications, images exhibit similarity at multiple granularities with visual semantic concepts, e.g. fashion demonstrates similarity ranging from clothing of the exact same instance to similar looks/design or a common category. Therefore, training image triplets/pairs used for metric learning inherently possess different degree of information. However, the existing methods often treats them with equal importance during training. This hinders capturing the underlying granularities in feature similarity required for effective visual search. ::: In view of this, we propose a new deep semantic granularity metric learning (SGML) that develops a novel idea of leveraging attribute semantic space to capture different granularity of similarity, and then integrate this information into deep metric learning. The proposed method simultaneously learns image attributes and embeddings using multitask CNNs. The two tasks are not only jointly optimized but are further linked by the semantic granularity similarity mappings to leverage the correlations between the tasks. To this end, we propose a new soft-binomial deviance loss that effectively integrates the degree of information in training samples, which helps to capture visual similarity at multiple granularities. Compared to recent ensemble-based methods, our framework is conceptually elegant, computationally simple and provides better performance.

The aim of this research is to evaluate Support Vector Machine method (SVM) for identifying Pecan Weevil among other insects. Eventually, this recognition system will serve in a wireless imaging network for monitoring Pecan Weevils. Approach: SVM has been evaluated using two different kernel functions i.e., Polynomial Function and Radial Basis Function. Database of 205 Pecan Weevils and 75 other insects which typically exist in pecan habitat has been used. Three sets of input data for SVM have been generated by two standard region-based recognition methods. These sets are comprised of output obtained by Zernike Moments, Regional Properties and combination of these two methods. For each kernel function, the system had been trained by 25, 50 and 75% of data and remaining ratio in each case has been used for testing. Each experiment is repeated ten times and average results are considered for comparisons and analysis. Results: The optimum recognition rate had been found when system is trained by 75% of data.

Due to the good learning ability of support vector machine, it can learn the relationship between the hidden information and corresponding watermarked image; when the watermarked image is attacked by some intentional or unintentional attacks, the trained support vector machine can recover the right hidden information bits. The reliability of the proposed scheme has been tested under different attacks.

In this work, we propose a fine-grained breathing monitoring system, BreathListener, which leverages audio devices on smartphones to estimate the fine-grained breathing waveform in driving environments. By investigating the data collected from real driving environments, we find that Energy Spectrum Density (ESD) of acoustic signals can be utilized to capture breathing procedures in driving environments. To extract breathing pattern in ESD signals, BreathListener eliminates interference from driving environments in ESD signals utilizing background subtraction and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD). After that, the extracted breathing pattern is transformed into Hilbert spectrum, and we further design a deep learning architecture based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate fine-grained breathing waveform from the Hilbert spectrum of extracted breathing patterns in ESD signals.

Fortunately, the structure information of materials, reflecting region of homogeneity in the spatial domain, offers an invaluable complement to the spectral information. Assuming some spatial regularity and locality of surface materials, it is reasonable to segment the image into different homogeneous parts in advance, called superpixel, which can be used to improve the classification performance. In this paper, a superpixel-based multitask learning framework has been proposed for hyperspectral image classification. Specifically, a set of 2-D Gabor filters are first applied to hyperspectral images to extract discriminative features. Meanwhile, a superpixel map is generated from the hyperspectral images. Second, a superpixel-based spatial\u2013spectral Schroedinger eigenmaps (S4E) method is adopted to effectively reduce the dimensions of each extracted Gabor cube. Finally, the classification is carried out by a support vector machine (SVM)-based multitask learning framework. The proposed approach is thus termed Gabor S4E and SVM-based multitask learning (GS4E-MTLSVM).

However, the use of these two kinds of features together can complement some features that may be unconsciously used by humans in daily life but have not been realized yet.

A new human-computer interaction controlled by dynamic gestures is also achieved. The proposed algorithm extracts Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and weighted Hu invariant moments from RGB and depth map of the interested region of gestures respectively, and fuses weighted Hu invariant moments into HOG. Then, we establish Support Vector Machine model (SVM) for static hand gestures recognition. Base on this, an HMM toolbox supporting multi-dimensional continuous data input is adopted to do the training and dynamic gesture recognition. Finally, the visual simulation software Vega Prime is applied to simulate a virtual UAV flight controlled by dynamic gestures. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective and accurate in complex background and practical real-time applications. Introduction Recently, with the rapid development of computer vision technology, the growing popularity of the human-computer interaction has led to a revolution in gesture recognition, and Human-computer interaction based on dynamic gesture recognition is also becoming more popular. In this paper, the recognition algorithm of dynamic gestures, which based on depth information, is proposed. The algorithm mainly consists of feature extraction, fusion and HMM classifier. Finally, the three-dimensional modeling software Creator is applied to build 3D models and visual simulation software Vega Prime to simulate, achieving a visual simulation of flight system controlled by dynamic gestures based on the proposed algorithm. Dynamic gesture recognition In this paper, two features combined with the SVM classifier is applied to identify the different types of static gestures, and the dynamic gesture recognition is achieved by HMM training. The two features are HOG and weighted Hu invariant moments extracted from RGB and depth map of the interested region of gestures. Gesture feature extraction and fusion. Unlike other image geometric features, HOG does not consider the image characteristics from a whole, but subdivides image into several small cell units, and then calculates the gradient or edge direction histogram of each pixel in all cells. To improve performance, a number of cells making up a block, thus the image becomes a connected graph consisting of many blocks, then normalizes the gradient of all cells in these blocks and obtains the final direction of gradient vector. A brief flowchart of extracting the HOG is given in Fig.1. Input image HOG feature vector Calculate the gradient of the horizontal and vertical direction The gradient direction histogram statistics within the Cell The gradient direction histogram statistics within the Block Fig.1 A brief flowchart of extracting the HOG The basic idea in Ref. [1] is used in this paper, and makes improvements according to gestures itself characteristics. As shown in Fig. 2, considering the differences mainly in the finger part, RGB image of gesture obtained through kinect is divided into five regions, this system only extracts HOG feature in (2), (3), (4) area shown in Fig. 2. International Industrial Informatics and Computer Engineering Conference (IIICEC 2015) \u00a9 2015. The authors Published by Atlantis Press 1836 Fig.2 Gesture area images In order to get the overall shape and contour characteristic, the Hu invariant moments of the binary image is selected as a gesture feature parameter in this page. Hu invariant moment is a good solution to solve the scale changes, image translation changes, rotation of the coordinate transformation in the process. Due to different Hu moment's contribution to the behavior criterion value is different in the feature extraction, so should take full account of the contribution values of different moment to construct a weighted Hu moment. In this paper, nine extended Hu moments are modified in linear programming to find the optimal weights for each Hu moment, and then construct a weighted modified Hu moments. Set a new weighted fixed Hu structure as: 9 '' '' '' 1 1 2 2 9 9 1 , 1,0 1 i i i \u03c3 \u03c3 \u03c3 \u03c3 \u03c3 = \u03a6 = \u03a6 + \u03a6 + + \u03a6 = < < \u2211 \uf04c (1) The specific solving process of the weighted Hu moments is presented in Ref. [2]. In order to better describe the gesture feature, this page refers to Ref. [3,4], and propose fusing HOG features and weighted Hu moment feature to describe gesture image. Before the feature fusion, HOG vectors HOG F and weighted Hu moments vector Hu F are normalized to ' HOG F and ' Hu F with the largest-minimum principle. After normalization, we fuse two kinds of features with corresponding weights represented as F in ' ' 1 2 1 2 [ , ], 1. HOG Hu F w F w F w w = + = (2) A whole process of the proposed algorithm is shown in Fig. 3. Fig.3 The overall process of feature fusion Gesture recognition and tracking. Feature after fusion is regarded as the input of SVM. SMO (Sequential Minimal Optimiz-ation) algorithm is selected for training in SVM, and Gaussian kernel function for inner product operations. Then the results of SVM training regarded as the HMM state vector , and select the center of gravity of adjacent palm direction vector as an HMM 's output observation variable, to train and recognize dynamic gestures.

Different classification tasks require different learning schemes to be satisfactorily solved. Most real-world datasets can be modeled only by complex structures resulting from deep data exploration with a number of different classification and data transformation methods. The search through the space of complex structures must be augmented with reliable validation strategies. All these techniques were necessary to build accurate models for the five high-dimensional datasets of the NIPS 2003 Feature Selection Challenge. Several feature selection algorithms (e.g. based on variance, correlation coefficient, decision trees) and several classification schemes (e.g. nearest neighbors, Normalized RBF, Support Vector Machines) were used to build complex models which transform the data and then classify.

These platforms have 2 issues which we aim to solve. First, Currently in Udemy the questions asked in discussion forum are not divided based on course videos, i.e. there is common discussion forum where question with respect to any content in the course can be asked. This is problem because, when a new question is asked all the question in the discussion forum have to be compared with the new question for similarity. This can take up significant amount of computational time. To avoid this we have applied Random Forest classifier to find out the category of a newly asked question (with respect to Udemy it would mean finding which video the question relates to), if category is found only previously asked questions in the particular category are compared for similarity rather than the previously asked questions in the whole database. Second, Currently NPTEL is not course coordinator friendly.

Our proposed method achieved a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.92 while FCN and the level set achieved 0.90 and 0.79 respectively. Particularly, for malignant lesions, our method increases the DSC (0.90) of the fully connected neural network to 0.93 significantly (p < 0.001).

Abnormal behavior detection is a data analysis task that identifies interesting and emerging patterns from data. Many research in the area of abnormal behavior detection has used machine learning and deep learning techniques to classify anomaly traffic from normal traffic. However, due the massive volumes of data that need to be analyzed and the fast development of attacks, most of the existing machine learning and deep learning solutions for network intrusion detection have low accuracy and less scalability over long period of time, thus an efficient distributed deep detection method is required.

Our aim is to explore the suitability of big data analytics and deep learning techniques in the context of abnormal behavior detection system. First, a distributed stacked denoising sparse autoencoder is applied to perform an unsupervised non-linear dimensionality reduction. Then, the reduced features are embed to the distributed SVM for classification. The approach is carried out using the iterative reduce paradigm based on Spark.

Moreover, inherent complexities like uncertainty, vagueness and overlapping among clusters make the analysis of real life categorical data set more difficult. Recent literature review shows that the well-known categorical data clustering techniques are using different similarity/dissimilarity measures to tackle the inherent complexities of the categorical attribute values. Generally, it is hard to find single method and cluster validity measure that can be used as perfect or standard for all kinds of categorical data sets. Hence, in this paper first, a clustering method for categorical data is proposed by fusing rough set and fuzzy set theories. Subsequently, an ensemble based framework is designed with the recently proposed similarity/dissimilarity measures in order to have better clustering results for different types of categorical data sets. For this purpose, the proposed rough fuzzy clustering method is used sequentially with the integration of different measures to evolve the clustering solutions. Using consensus of these solutions, pure classified, semi rough and pure rough points are identified. Thereafter, machine learning method, called Random Forest, is used in incremental way to classify the semi and pure rough points using pure classified points to yield better clustering results. The performance of the proposed method has been demonstrated in comparison with several other recently developed clustering methods. Additionally, the selection of Random Forest in the proposed framework is justified by comparing its performance with other well-known machine learning methods like K-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machine.

To our knowledge, the data model used in most of the distributed algorithms is linear. However, in real applications, the linearity of systems is not always guaranteed. In nonlinear cases, the single hidden layer feedforward neural network (SLFN) with radial basis function (RBF) hidden neurons has the ability to approximate any continuous functions and, thus, may be used as the nonlinear learning system. However, confined by the communication cost, using the distributed version of the conventional algorithms to train the neural network directly is usually prohibited. Fortunately, based on the theorems provided in the extreme learning machine (ELM) literature, we only need to compute the output weights of the SLFN. Computing the output weights itself is a linear learning problem, although the input-output mapping of the overall SLFN is still nonlinear.

SADHS has been used for optimal selection of the hidden layer parameters, the bias of neurons of the hidden-layer, and the regularization factor of robust least squares, whereas ELM has been applied to obtain the output weights analytically using a robust least squares solution.

This highlights the critical importance of the Niagara Frontier International border crossing, one of North America\u2019s busiest portals for travel and trade. This study had two primary objectives. The first objective was to develop a forecasting method for the on-line, short-term prediction of hourly traffic volumes at the Niagara Frontier border crossings. The second objective of the study was to develop queuing models which would use the predicted traffic volume to estimate the future border delay. As a case study, the project considers the Peace Bridge border crossing, which is one of the busiest Niagara Frontier border crossings, serving over 4.76 million cars annually. For the short-term prediction of hourly volumes at the Peace Bridge, a novel method was developed, which combines forecasts from traditional time series analysis, specifically the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model, with forecasts made by Support Vector Regression (SVR). The two models\u2019 forecasts are combined using: (1) a simple fixed weight procedure; and (2) the fuzzy adaptive variable weight method, based on the Fresh Degree Function. Based on an analysis of the diurnal distribution of traffic volumes, six separate classes are defined and individual models are developed for weekdays (Monday - Thursday), Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, holidays and game days. The evaluation results for that part of the study appear to confirm the hypothesis that, while the SARIMA model does a good job capturing the linear characteristics of the data (e.g., seasonality and trend), SVR appears to outperform SARIMA in modeling the data\u2019s nonlinear aspects. The study also shows that combining forecasts from the two models, especially using the fuzzy adaptive variable weight method, yields excellent prediction performance, with values for the Mean Absolute Percent Error in the predictions of only about 7%. For estimating future border delay, the study built and solved an inverse M/M/c queuing model, where it was assumed that arrivals followed a Poisson distribution, service times followed an exponential distribution, and that the system had c service stations open. An inverse model was needed because the hourly volumes predicted from the first part of the study were outgoing volumes (i.e. volumes leaving the border customs and inspection stations), and not incoming volumes.

Moreover, since the last convolutional layer in a CNN has highly class-specific information, giving equal importance to all the channels causes to extract less discriminative features in comparison to weighting each of the channels adaptively. The fact that data labeling as well as creating ground truth on large data set is expensive is another point of concern in this regard. To address these problems, we have proposed a novel method for classification of aerial images. Our method includes proposing a new loss function, which enhances the focus of the network on hard examples by adding a new term to CE as a penalty term, bringing about the state-of-the-art results; designing a new multilayer perceptron (MLP) as a classifier, in which the used attention mechanism extracts more discriminative features by weighting each of the channels adaptively; and applying transfer learning strategy by adopting neural architecture search network mobile (NASNet Mobile) as a feature descriptor for the first time in the field of aerial images, which can mitigate the aforementioned costs.

Analyzing the fragmentation level of the landscape formation reflects the management strategy and overall success of decision makers. This paper aims to assessment landscape fragmentation in relation to green corridor planning for the first time on coastal section of Trabzon and Rize city centers from South Eastern part of the Black Sea. The study area is densely populated coastal region with linear-littoral formation. Remote Sensing (RS), Geographical Information System (GIS) and in-situ techniques were used to detect pattern and role of green corridors in the study area. Green coverage was extracted by using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm. SVM classifier performed better on digital aerial images when compared to multispectral satellite data. After the classification, five land use/cover (LULC) classes were obtained: urban green areas, asphalt ways, water, other urban objects and shades with 94.64 and 96.53 overall accuracies for Trabzon and Rize cities, respectively. Shape related landscape metrics were computed to show the level of fragmented green covers in study area. Larger patches were observed in Rize with higher Largest Patch Index (LPI) values. Computed Area Weighted Mean Shape Index (AWMSI) and Area Weighted Mean Patch Fractal Dimension (AWMPFD) values indicated higher urbanization rates in Trabzon city. Green corridor networks were proposed for each city by considering the fragmentation level and landscape design rules.

The proposed method can also give high specificity rate without reducing the sensitivity which is better than earlier methods an d fisher sign test can be also used to find the statistical differences.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.15623/ijret.2014.0301050", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Research in Engineering and Technology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2182138272", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9744521", "26061303", "6037291", "6472932", "33999976", "3547382", "15898752", "5766386", "4837289", "125908756", "24166228", "15365822", "14312391"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16175086"}

Detecting heart disease is a great challenge for medical practitioners with high level of accuracy so that a patients life is saved. Large amount of medical data are being generated which can be useful for the physicians, various data mining algorithm helps us to find meaningful insights from data which would otherwise remain undiscovered. My research aims to deploy a model that gives us the highest performance metric (accuracy, sensitivity,specificity and kappa) among the three algorithm Random Forest, Logistic regression and Artificial Neural Network so that a patient life is saved in places where there is lack of medical practitioners. I would be following the CRISPDM data mining methodology. Supervised classification algorithm is used to classify the heart disease in the UCI-ML data set which consists of 14 attribute and 303 observations. The effect of detecting heart disease is to render in the different data mining algorithm in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and kappa with the sole motive of obtaining more superior results than any other research method. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and kappa of ANN is 79%, 85%, 73% and 59%, whereas that of Random forest is 80%, 83%, 78% and 61% percent and Logistic regression is 85%, 89%, 80% and 70% percent,which clearly shows that Logistic regression outperforms the other two algorithm in terms of all the performance measures.

To address this issue, a novel adaptive spatial\u2013spectral feature learning network (ASSFL) has been proposed to reflect spatial contexture changes and learn robust adaptive features in this paper. In the implementation of the proposed method, a convolution neural network (CNN) is first applied to learn weight features for each pixel within a hyperspectral patch and adaptive weights can be obtained based on a softmax normalization. Then, the shallow joint adaptive features can be acquired according to these weights. After that, a stacked auto-encoder (SAE) is proposed to further extract deeper hierarchical features for the final classification.

In this paper, we address the data sparsity problem in a target domain by transferring knowledge about both users and items from auxiliary data sources. We observe that in different domains the user feedbacks are often heterogeneous such as ratings vs. clicks. Our solution is to integrate both user and item knowledge in auxiliary data sources through a principled matrix-based transfer learning framework that takes into account the data heterogeneity. In particular, we discover the principle coordinates of both users and items in the auxiliary data matrices, and transfer them to the target domain in order to reduce the effect of data sparsity. We describe our method, which is known as coordinate system transfer or CST, and demonstrate its effectiveness in alleviating the data sparsity problem in collaborative filtering.

The main contribution is in training phase that it is the combination of SVM with PSO algorithm, resulting in computational load and processing time reduction. This novel algorithm is called here as PSO-SVM hybrid training application and its performance is shown as the experimental results of voice signal commands in Brazilian Portuguese language. Such commands comprise 10 isolated digits (from zero to nine) and 20 action commands such as \u201cgo ahead\u201d, \u201cfinish\u201d, \u201cpause\u201d, etc.; that is, there are 30 different pattern types (classes) to be separated (recognized). The process is speaker independent type, that is, the voice bank used in training is different from the one used in tests. The obtained results presented success rates of 92% to 99% during the tests for the classifier using RBF kernel function. Besides, the comparison section shows that this technique is 25 times faster than the recognition without optimization and also, it presents 10% of improvement in recognition success rate when compared to the well-known technique, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) algorithm.

It is accomplished by identifying opinion aspect entities (including object entities and attribute entities) and then aligning object entities to attribute entities. Recent studies on knowledge graphs have shown that by adding the embeddings of semantic structures between opinion aspect entities, structure-based learning models can achieve better performance in link-prediction than traditional methods. The studies, however, focused only on learning semantic structures between aspect entities, did not take language expression features into account. In this paper, we propose the Fusion RElation Embedded Representation Learning (FREERL) framework, by which, one can fuse semantic structures and language expression features such as statistical co-occurrence or dependency syntax, into the embeddings of object entities and attribute entities. The obtained embeddings are then used to align object-attribute pairs and to predict new pairs in a zero-shot scenario.

Class imbalance is ubiquitous in Machine Learning, Data Mining and Pattern Recognition applications; therefore, these research communities have responded to such interest with literally dozens of methods and techniques. Surprisingly, there are still many fundamental open-ended questions such as \"Are all learning paradigms equally affected by class imbalance?\", \"What is the expected performance loss for different imbalance degrees?\" and \"How much of the performance losses can be recovered by the treatment methods?\". In this paper, we propose a simple experimental design to assess the performance of class imbalance treatment methods. This experimental setup uses real data set with artificially modified class distributions to evaluate classifiers in a wide range of class imbalance. We apply such experimental design in a large-scale experimental evaluation with 22 data set and seven learning algorithms from different paradigms. We also propose a statistical procedure aimed to evaluate the relative degradation and recoveries, based on confidence intervals. This procedure allows a simple yet insightful visualization of the results, as well as provide the basis for drawing statistical conclusions. Our results indicate that the expected performance loss, as a percentage of the performance obtained with the balanced distribution, is quite modest (below 5 %) for the most balanced distributions up to 10 % of minority examples. However, the loss tends to increase quickly for higher degrees of class imbalance, reaching 20 % for 1 % of minority class examples. Support Vector Machine is the classifier paradigm that is less affected by class imbalance, being almost insensitive to all but the most imbalanced distributions. Finally, we show that the treatment methods only partially recover the performance losses. On average, typically, about 30 % or less of the performance that was lost due to class imbalance was recovered by these methods.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10115-014-0794-3", "venue": "Knowledge and Information Systems", "journal": "Knowledge and Information Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1986959058", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["207155015", "28008642", "961425", "1554582", "8446587", "15428347", "6492502", "207624573", "53653128", "59849738", "14972567", "18057117", "1438164", "206742563", "39321012", "195705776", "1795112", "206793438", "6684051", "15773445", "10776829", "477985", "13463620", "5262555", "12849464", "12974520", "1212431", "16326925", "2344521"], "inbound_citations": ["4019412", "44102770", "31157814", "49558812", "38645470", "13885679", "52984835", "3620855", "205462797", "203636521", "214699587", "7655526", "15704569", "207475120", "17799705", "207801938", "17123336", "202662229", "31208868", "49583566", "9450565", "22779444", "29776331", "203605431", "53111799", "3654645", "207166287", "211210121", "31634926", "4475862", "51923557", "202158849", "53116800", "13729860", "53568828", "18584984", "202700660", "13960927", "70036935", "3373087", "42047962", "211207482", "51615688", "2302663"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14766472"}

Given the complexity of directly measuring vehicular radiated emissions in real traffic, the main contribution of this PhD thesis is to propose an indirect solution to estimate such type of vehicular emissions. Relating the on-road vehicular radiated emissions with the driving profile is a complicated task. This is because it is not possible to directly measure the vehicular radiated interferences in real traffic due to potential interferences from another electromagnetic wave sources. This thesis presents a microscopic artificial intelligence model based on neural networks to estimate real traffic radiated emissions of electric vehicles in terms of the driving dynamics. Instantaneous values of measured speed and calculated acceleration have been used to characterize the driving profile. Experimental electromagnetic interference tests have been carried out with a Vectrix electric motorcycle as well as Twizy electric cars in semi-anechoic chambers. Both the motorcycle and the car have been subjected to different urban and interurban driving profiles. Time Domain measurement methodology of electromagnetic radiated emissions has been adopted in this work to save the overall measurement time. The relationship between the magnetic radiated emissions of the Twizy and the corresponding speed has been very noticeable. Maximum magnetic field levels have been observed during high speed cruising in extra-urban driving and acceleration in urban environments. A comparative study of the prediction performance between various static and dynamic neural models has been introduced. The Multilayer Perceptron feedforward neural network trained with Extreme Learning Machines has achieved the best estimation results of magnetic radiated disturbances as function of instantaneous speed and acceleration. In this way, on-road magnetic radiated interferences from an electric vehicle equipped with a Global Positioning System can be estimated. This research line will allow quantify the pollutant electromagnetic emissions of electric vehicles and study new policies to preserve the environment.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2281695954", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:111726345"}

In addition, it is robust and has less dependence on word embedding as compared to previous observations.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": "1508.01991", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null,

Our method compares a sliding nine-residue long fragment of the target sequence to all such fragments in the database and keeps up to 150 candidate fragments with the highest profile-profile score. For each candidate sequence, a dot plot of the positions of the fragments in the target sequence against the positions of the matched fragments in the candidate sequence is drawn. A homology score is derived for each candidate sequence from the pattern of the dot plot. To evaluate our method on protein family classification, we ran it on a well benchmarked dataset derived from SCOP (Structural Classification of Proteins) version 1.53, including 4352 domain sequences. The results show that our method is more accurate than any previously published methods, including Support Vector Machine (SVM) and HMM (Hidden Markov Model) based methods. To evaluate the power of homology detection with a single query sequence, we also tested our method on 803 SCOP family pairs (1606 domain sequences each of which has another sequence within the same family while all others are not within the same superfamily) and 480 superfamily pairs (960 domain sequences each of which has another sequence within the same superfamily but not the same family) derived from SCOP version 1.73.

Two types of feature extractions are applied to provide the inputs to the SVM, i.e. the minimum and maximum peak voltage values and the wavelet energy level of the transients. The IEEE 30 bus system is modeled using the Power System Computer Aided Design (PSCAD) software to generate different type of transient data caused by capacitor switching and lightning.

Hence training set selection holds an important place in the classification task. This training set selection plays an important role in improving the performance of the classifier and reducing the time taken for training. This can be done using various methods like algorithms, data-handling techniques, cost-sensitive methods, ensembles and so on. In this work, one of the data complexity measures, Maximum Fisher\u2019s discriminant ratio (F1), has been used to determine the good training instances. This measure discriminates any two classes using a specific feature by comparing the class means and variances. This measure in particular provides the overlap between the classes. In the first phase, F1 of the whole data set is calculated. After that, F1 using leave-one-out method is computed to rank each of the instances. Finally, the instances that lower the F1 value are all removed as a batch from the data set. According to F1, a small value represents a strong overlap between the classes. Therefore if those instances that cause more overlap are removed then overlap will reduce further. Empirically demonstrated in this work, the efficacy of the proposed reduction algorithm (DRF1) using 4 different classifiers (Random Forest, Decision Tree-C5.0, SVM and kNN) and 6 data sets (Pima, Musk, Sonar, Winequality(R and W) and Wisconsin).

A case study was carried out using data from Catanduanes Island (Philippines) to investigate further (a) if RF modeling can be used for data-driven modeling of mineral prospectivity in areas with few (i.e., <20) mineral occurrences and (b) if RF modeling can handle predictor variables with missing values. We found that RF modeling outperforms evidential belief (EB) modeling of prospectivity for hydrothermal Au\u2013Cu deposits in Catanduanes Island, where 17 hydrothermal Au\u2013Cu prospects are known to exist. Moreover, just like EB modeling, RF modeling allows analysis of the spatial relationships between known prospects and individual layers of predictor data. Furthermore, RF modeling can handle missing values in predictor data through an RF-based imputation technique whereas in EB modeling, missing values are simply represented by maximum uncertainty. Therefore, the RF algorithm is a potentially useful method for data-driven predictive modeling of mineral prospectivity in regions with few (i.e., <20) occurrences of mineral deposits of the type sought. However, further testing of the method in other regions with few mineral occurrences is warranted to fully determine its usefulness in data-driven predictive modeling of mineral prospectivity.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11053-015-9268-x", "venue": "Natural Resources Research", "journal": "Natural Resources Research", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "342324839", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["128894589", "121877087", "121894321", "55058842", "140632653", "128503818", "17363725", "135067565", "129029429", "123240738", "128331017", "60993494", "207738357", "89141", "127534335", "140724144", "128954442", "14587985", "128638999", "129358040", "129603074", "20670858", "129844312", "115469692", "128715331", "129071685", "10895910", "128621980", "129933245", "8901301", "131004438", "12872756", "128432743", "206380316", "129794850", "60930355", "55639350", "18197554", "84570364", "107429595", "128189562", "119621827", "44392420", "6023926", "84202337", "82348326", "54717521", "15000608", "128964122", "11077516", "131652903", "128917247", "126654981", "140618933", "12211379", "126923717", "28022769", "61282562", "122211432", "122872118", "62333196", "126454173", "8884857", "6336016", "129774903", "128895158", "62545585", "127842089", "122879482", "109372091", "117960937", "120228976", "122185261", "2089531", "129260885", "295147", "129029204", "134904758"], "inbound_citations": ["208302771", "198419734", "214784517", "212742882", "135128043", "20519603", "198410366", "132525654", "155446962", "125518368", "133708914", "202733606", "133514925", "56003493", "153314365", "59310713", "67766677", "134569504", "203653916", "133934661", "69927629", "209392366", "113638840", "130475248", "59062722", "126283318", "207988370", "126283342", "204848763"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:127632303"}

The recent explosion of machine learning algorithms has provided researchers with the opportunity to develop advanced statistical tools for automatically classifying lithology from these logs, enabling geologists to rapidly produce first-pass interpretations and validate others, even when core samples are missing or damaged. However, the machine learning algorithms need to be evaluated in the case where wells contain a large number of wireline logs which are highly-sampled. This paper explores different machine learning algorithms and architectures for classifying lithologies (e.g. coal and sandstone) using wireline data from a project area well-known for coal mineralisation: Juandah East, 60km north-west of Wandoan (Queensland, Australia). We used data from seven wells, each containing 19 wireline logs uniformly sampled at 1cm, retrieved from the open Queensland Digital Exploration (QDEX) database.Three popular supervised machine learners, namely the Naive Bayes classifier, Support Vector Machine, and Artificial Neural Network, were tested under two architectures: committee (one classifier per well log) and singular (one classifier for all well logs). Favourable performance was achieved under both architectures when the base classifier was tuned to maximise a coal-specific performance metric. Results show that the committee architecture increased overall accuracy, generally by increasing accuracy on the dominant lithology class and reducing the classification rate of minor lithology classes. Overall accuracy was further improved by post-processing to remove thin classified intervals ( < 10 cm ). The committee architecture provides the benefits of faster classifier training time through parallelisation, as well as a flexible platform for incorporating additional well logs without the need to retrain existing classifiers. HighlightsMachine learning methods classify lithologies using highly sampled wireline logs.Different classifiers and architectures are compared for practical industry use.A committee architecture provides parallelised well-based lithology classification.Lithology classifiers are optimised for coal exploration.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cageo.2015.07.013", "venue": "Comput.

The evolutionary technique is compared withseveral classic algorithms for inducing decision trees and rules,using classi\ufb01cation accuracy as the comparison criterion. I. I NTRODUCTION Data mining (DM) consists of the extraction of useful, com-prehensible and previously unknown knowledge, from hugeamounts of data stored in different formats [16]. Classi\ufb01cationis one of the most studied problems by DM and machinelearning (ML) researchers. It consists in predicting the value ofa (categorical) attribute (the class) based on the values of otherattributes (the predicting attributes). In the ML and DM \ufb01elds,classi\ufb01cation is usually approached as a supervised learningtask. A search algorithm is used to induce a classi\ufb01er from aset of correctly classi\ufb01ed data instances, called the train set.Another set of correctly classi\ufb01ed data instances, known as thetest set is used to measure the quality of the classi\ufb01er obtainedafter the learning process. Different paradigms have been usedin order to tackle classi\ufb01cation: decision trees [10], inductivelearning [8], instance-based learning [1] and, more recently,arti\ufb01cial neural networks [18] and evolutionary algorithms [4].In this paper, we focus on decision tree, rule induction andevolutionary techniques.Decision tree methods use greedy algorithms. These algo-rithms are generally fast, very effective, accurate and ableto classify data completely. Most decision tree methods userecursive partitioning techniques that split the data space.However, the greedy nature of these algorithms can overlookmultivariate relationships that can\u2019t be found when attributesare considered separately. Rule induction algorithms usuallyemploy a speci\ufb01c-to-general approach, in which rules aregeneralized (or specialized) until a satisfactory descriptionof each class is obtained. Finally, evolutionary algorithms(EA) are based on the use of probabilistic search algorithmsinspired by certain points of the Darwinian theory of evolution.The \ufb02exibility and robustness of EAs allow the discoveryof complex relationships that are usually missed by otheralgorithms.In addition to the learning algorithm, another importantissue that must be considered in classi\ufb01cation is the repre-sentation formalism. Rules are one of the most often usedformalisms used to represent classi\ufb01ers, and is the one we havechosen for our work (a decision tree can be easily convertedinto a rule set [12]). The rule antecedent (IF part) contains acombination of conditions on the predicting attributes, and therule consequent (THEN part) contains the predicted value forthe class. This way, a rule assigns a data instance to the classpointed out by the consequent if the values of the predictingattributes satisfy the conditions expressed in the antecedent,and so, a classi\ufb01er is represented as a rule set. The rules usedin our work have the following format.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2183337578", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["207670313", "57323334", "9504560", "6596", "36237350", "58427035", "61536073", "209099422", "13252401", "5262555", "115293622", "60855088", "61973115", "12866037", "60602644"], "inbound_citations": ["29709936", "11811399", "4950", "18696991"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53993944"}

Then, the Monte Carlo non-information variable elimination (MC-UVE) algorithm was used to screen the soil total nitrogen sensitive wavelengths of the three soil types, the common sensitive spectral regions of different soil types were screened, and the spectral wavelength ranges were 895-911 nm, 1047-1065 nm, 1211-1232 nm, 1468-1482 nm, 1691-1699 nm and 2095-2109 nm.

Both question and answer expressions are based on multiple EDUs (Elementary Discourse Units) where each EDU is equivalent to a simple sentence or a clause. The research involves two main problems: how to identify the question types of Why, How, and Request-Diagnosis and how to determine the corresponding answer from the knowledge source after solving the question focuses. Thus, the research applies different machine learning techniques, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine, to solve the reasoning question type identification. The knowledge source contains several symptom-treatment vector pairs and several cause-effect vector pairs.

The Random Prism classifier has recently been proposed as an alternative to the popular Random Forests classifier, which is based on decision trees. Random Prism is based on the Prism family of algorithms, which is more robust to noise.

Three problems of artillery rocket performance are addressed under known ambient conditions to predict 1) the range for the specified firing angle, 2) the firing angle for the specified range, and 3) the range obtainable under standard (specified) conditions. The neural model bypass the need for any mathematical modeling or their solutions as hitherto resorted to for predicting the trajectory performance. For the purpose of present study, data from the range table of G-rocket, supplied by the user agency, are used. An appropriate set of input/output variables from the given data is selected to train, validate, and predict via the proposed neural models. A comparison of the neural model estimate with the values from the range table shows close agreement for all the proposed neural models. I. Introduction rtillery forms an important wing of an army in providing firepower, during both war and cross-border skirmishes with the enemy. Artillery rockets are a class of projectiles around which much of the aeroballistic theory was originally developed, and it continues to form a significant part of the aero ballistician\u2019s interest. The effectiveness of artillery rocket is largely judged by the accuracy in hitting the targets. Various error sources inherent in the rocket system, together with the external conditions such as wind, cause dispersion of the rocket from its intended path. The actual path traversed by the rocket is compared to the predicted trajectory in order to calculate its accuracy. Beginning with the simplest, but relatively inaccurate, in-vacuo trajectory mathematical model, more and more sophisticated models of increasing accuracy, such as the point mass model, the modified point mass model, and the six-degree of freedom model, 1 have been developed. However, even the best of these models have their limitations because of 1) an inability to model all of the problem variables (e.g., the initial conditions at the time of rocket leaving the launcher, the tip-off effect, the aerodynamic jump, the variable atmospheric conditions, etc.) and 2) the non-availability of accurate and reliable aerodynamic coefficients (e.g. drag coefficient, damping in roll derivatives, etc.) required as inputs by the mathematical models. The recent interest in evolving applications of artificial neural networks (ANN) to diverse fields such as signal processing, pattern recognition, robotics, medical diagnosis, system identification, and control have led many researchers to explore their capability for aerospace engineering problems.

Conventional approaches, although useful for different image types, are time consuming. Of late, deep learning (DL) based image registration methods have been proposed that outperform traditional methods in terms of accuracy and time. However,DL based methods are heavily dependent on training data and do not generalize well when presented with images of different scanners or anatomies. We present a DL based approach that can perform medical image registration of one image type despite being trained with images of a different type. This is achieved by unsupervised domain adaptation in the registration process and allows for easier application to different datasets without extensive retraining.To achieve our objective we train a network that transforms the given input image pair to a latent feature space vector using autoencoders.

The algorithm aims to generate an excellent initial population to accelerate the evolutionary process and improve the evolutionary performance in solving DMOPs. When an environmental change is detected, a regression transfer learning prediction model is constructed by reusing the historical population, which can predict objective values.

Recent advances in deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown significant successes in medical image analysis and particularly in computational histopathology. Because of the outrageous large size of WSIs, most of the methods divide one slide into lots of small image patches and perform classification on each patch independently. However, neighboring patches often share spatial correlations, and ignoring these spatial correlations may result in inconsistent predictions. In this paper, we propose a neural conditional random field (NCRF) deep learning framework to detect cancer metastasis in WSIs. NCRF considers the spatial correlations between neighboring patches through a fully connected CRF which is directly incorporated on top of a CNN feature extractor. The whole deep network can be trained end-to-end with standard back-propagation algorithm with minor computational overhead from the CRF component. The CNN feature extractor can also benefit from considering spatial correlations via the CRF component. Compared to the baseline method without considering spatial correlations, we show that the proposed NCRF framework obtains probability maps of patch predictions with better visual quality. We also demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline in cancer metastasis detection on the Camelyon16 dataset and achieves an average FROC score of 0.8096 on the test set.

Intent Detection and Slot Filling joint task, as one of the core sub-tasks in NLU, has been widely used in different human\u2013computer interaction scenarios. In the current era of deep learning, the joint task of Intent Detection and Slot Filling has also changed from previous rule-based methods to deep learning-based methods. It is an important problem to explore how to realize the models of these tasks to be refined and targeted designed, and to make the Intent Detection task better serve the improvement of precision of Slot Filling task by connecting the before and after tasks. It has great significance for building a more humanized IoT voice interaction system. In this study, we designed two joint models to realize Intent Detection and Slot Filling joint task. For the Intent Detection type task, one is based on BiGRU-Att-CapsuleNet (hybrid-based model) and the other is based on the RCNN model. Both methods use the BiGRU-CRF model for the Slot Filling type task. The hybrid-based model can enhance the semantic capture capability of a single model. And by combining specialized models built independently for each task to achieve a complete joint task, it can be better to achieve optimal performance on each task.

Further, a necessary condition for real life applications is a method that allows, irrespective of the immense individual difference among participants, to have minimal variance over the individual classification accuracy. We conducted offline computer aided emotion classification experiments using strict experimental controls. We analyzed EEG data collected from nine participants using validated film clips to induce four different emotional states (amused, disgusted, sad and neutral). The classification rate was evaluated using both unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms (in total seven \u201cstate of the art\u201d algorithms were tested). The largest classification accuracy was computed by means of Support Vector Machine. Accuracy rate was on average 97.2%. The experimental protocol effectiveness was further supported by very small variance among individual participants\u2019 classification accuracy (within interval: 96.7%, 98.3%). Classification accuracy evaluated on reduced number of electrodes suggested, consistently with psychological constructionist approaches, that we were able to classify emotions considering cortical activity from areas involved in emotion representation.

Network stakeholders often inquire about the importance of sites and their locations when discussing funding and monitoring design. Support vector machines (SVMs) can be useful by their assigning each monitoring site as either a support or nonsupport vector. A potentiometric surface was created from synthetic data and 800 random observation locations (sites) as an analog to a groundwater-level network. Using generalized additive models for potentiometric surface prediction, simulations show that a subsample of support vectors from the 800 sites will out perform random samples of sample size equaling the support vector count. Support vector percentages from simulation quantify the recurrence that SVMs assign each site as a support vector, and these percentages in turn measure site importance.

This paper proposes two new approaches to modeling and compensating the rate-dependent hysteresis of a piezostage driven by piezoelectric stack actuators. By formulating the hysteresis modeling as an online nonlinear regression problem, online least squares support vector machine (SVM) (LS-SVM) and online relevance vector machine (RVM) models are proposed to capture the hysteretic behavior. Both hysteresis models are capable of updating continually with subsequent samples. After a comparative study on modeling performances, an inverse model-based feedforward combined with proportional-integral-derivative feedback control is presented to alleviate the hysteresis effect. Experimental results show that the LS-SVM model-based control scheme is over 86% more accurate than the RVM model-based one in the motion tracking task, whereas the latter is 14 times faster than the former in terms of updating time. Moreover, both LS-SVM and RVM model-based control schemes can suppress the rate-dependent hysteresis to a negligible level, which validates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TIE.2011.2166235", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2131339080", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["28263679", "21014505", "7070054", "19214905", "206697580", "28878291", "37588013", "12796572", "53512028", "6826307", "6671399", "34378671", "8714528", "62809347", "110873692", "14194052", "111121774", "119831209", "18197043", "1468855", "9216728", "111223280", "20837379", "19383743", "18138745", "6985522", "110320733", "14209424", "53306690", "5788943", "15832447", "8739360", "8334125", "206700540", "12656602", "6689364", "206700416", "110002315", "14589376", "10373909", "36198911"], "inbound_citations": ["5033792", "206703610", "202609047", "14681915", "36441792", "92992788", "3196474", "3196474", "55580841", "214692566", "22148859", "18335860", "6281514", "22167035", "16570130", "116695560", "18239528", "6493637", "15415146", "6878753", "38301417", "18100117", "3657340", "212636206", "125407436", "18071826", "503257", "122269743", "23467875", "19818319", "109910481", "8501002", "54723525", "29399946", "23351636", "202096607", "3777299", "15042290", "13724730", "12512093", "199132123", "19242819", "15562464", "17912599", "15424828", "92989541", "19768705", "44222475", "202610268", "38878655", "110774621", "115840447", "23377344", "9732890", "3923517", "15961695", "109661130", "201624605", "14868644", "210146135", "16049400", "22388978", "9011429", "53970575", "55206605", "4348594", "20685752", "46845339", "51793608", "10637711", "17252547", "11489752", "156020187", "13154655", "18232829", "12589875"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:29924345"}

Different from the most of current methods which make diagnosis on a bunch of existing vibration data, online diagnosis needs to find whether a fault or crack occurred from the data which are collected sequentially. In this scenario, it needs to update the diagnosis model by means of the new collected data. Moreover, to maintain the online diagnosis accuracy, it needs to extract the most representative fault features quickly. Following these two tasks, a new online bearing fault diagnosis method is proposed in this paper based on Incremental Support Vector Machine(ISVM) and Stacked Auto-Encoder(SAE) which is a kind of deep learning algorithm. This method contains two stages. At offline stage, the fault data are utilized to automatically extract the representative features by means of SAE, and then an offline diagnosis model is constructed by using ISVM. At online stage, for each new arrived data block, the network weight of offline SAE model is introduced to generate online fault feature vectors directly, and then the online diagnosis model is updated to incorporate the new data by integrating these features.

In order to demonstrate the working of SG-ELM on a real-world problem, an advanced combustion engine identification is considered. The algorithm is applied to two case studies: An online regression learning for system identification of a Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) Engine and an online classification learning (with class imbalance) for identifying the dynamic operating envelope.

However, traditional approaches such as named entity recognition and new word identification may only detect some specific types of entities. In addition, they generally adopt sequence annotation algorithms such as Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Conditional Random Field (CRF) which can only utilize limited context information. As a result, they are inefficient on the extraction of semantic entities that were never shown in the training data. In this paper we propose a strategy to extract unknown text semantic entities by integrating statistical features, Decision Tree (DT), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. With the proposed statistical features and novel classification approach, our strategy can detect more semantic entities than traditional approaches such as CRF and Bootstrapping-SVM methods. It is very sensitive to new entities that just appear in fresh data.

Due to their compact formulation they are cheap to evaluate and thus readily facilitate visualization, design space exploration, rapid prototyping, and sensitivity analysis. They can also be used as accurate building blocks in design packages or larger simulation environments. Consequently, there is great interest in techniques that facilitate the construction of such approximation models while minimizing the computational cost and maximizing model accuracy. Many surrogate model types exist (Support Vector Machines, Kriging, Neural Networks, etc.) but no type is optimal in all circumstances. Nor is there any hard theory available that can help make this choice. In this paper we present an automatic approach to the model type selection problem. We describe an adaptive global surrogate modeling environment with adaptive sampling, driven by speciated evolution. Different model types are evolved cooperatively using a Genetic Algorithm (heterogeneous evolution) and compete to approximate the iteratively selected data. In this way the optimal model type and complexity for a given data set or simulation code can be dynamically determined.

The aim of this work is to explore how four different classification algorithms, widely used in remote sensing, such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Networks (NN) and a well-known decision tree algorithm (C5.0), for classifying burned areas at global scale through a data mining methodology using 2008 MODIS data. A training database consisting of burned and unburned pixels was created from 130 Landsat scenes. The resulting database was highly unbalanced with the burned class representing less than one percent of the total. Therefore, the ability of the algorithms to cope with this problem was evaluated. Attribute selection was performed using three filters to remove potential noise and to reduce the dimensionality of the data: Random Forest, entropy-based filter, and logistic regression. Eight out of fifty-two attributes were selected, most of them related to the temporal difference of the reflectance of the bands. Models were trained using an 80% of the database following a ten-fold approach to reduce possible overfitting and to select the optimum parameters. Finally, the performance of the algorithms was evaluated over six different regions using official statistics where they were available and benchmark burned area products, namely MCD45 (V5.1) and MCD64 (V6). Compared to official statistics, the best agreement was obtained by MCD64 (OE = 0.15, CE = 0.29) followed by RF (OE = 0.27, CE = 0.21). For the remaining three areas (Angola, Sudan and South Africa), RF (OE = 0.47, CE = 0.45) yielded the best results when compared to the reference data. NN and SVM showed the worst performance with omission and commission error reaching 0.81 and 0.17 respectively. SVM and NN showed higher sensitivity to unbalanced datasets, as in the case of burned area, with a clear bias towards the majority class. On the other hand, tree based algorithms are more robust to this issue given their own mechanisms to deal with big and unbalanced databases.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jag.2018.05.027", "venue": "Int.

In particular, multispectral and hyperspectral imaging can be used for detecting lithologies and mineral alterations on the surface of actively degassing volcanoes. This paper proposes a novel workflow to integrate existing optical and laser remote sensing data for geological mapping after the 2012 Te Maari eruptions (Tongariro Volcanic Complex, New Zealand). The image classification is based on layer-stacking of image features (optical and textural) generated from high-resolution airborne hyperspectral imagery, Light Detection and Ranging data (LiDAR) derived terrain models, and aerial photography. The images were classified using a Random Forest algorithm where input images were added from multiple sensors. Maximum image classification accuracy (overall accuracy = 85%) was achieved by adding textural information (e.g. mean, homogeneity and entropy) to the hyperspectral and LiDAR data. This workflow returned a total surface alteration area of \u223c0.4 km2 at Te Maari, which was confirmed by field work, lab-spectroscopy and backscatter electron imaging. Hydrothermal alteration on volcanoes forms precipitation crusts on the surface that can mislead image classification.

Random Forest algorithm assuming non-parametric distribution was employed to predict the potential distribution of Betula utilis niche in the Hindu-Kush Himalayan (HKH) region.

Prediction challenges such as ImageNet [6]and MSCOCO [19] use only pixels, while other methods make predictions purely from social media context [21]. Our method is based on a novel fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework, where each node is an image, and consists of two deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and one Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that model both textual and visual node/image information. The edge weights of the CRF graph represent textual similarity and link-based metadata such as user sets and image groups. We model the CRF as an RNN for both learning and inference, and incorporate the weighted ranking loss and cross entropy loss into the CRF parameter optimization to handle the training data imbalance issue.

Most existing image classification methods use hand-crafted features, which are not adaptive for different image domains. In this paper, we develop an evolutionary learning methodology to automatically generate domain-adaptive global feature descriptors for image classification using multiobjective genetic programming (MOGP). In our architecture, a set of primitive 2-D operators are randomly combined to construct feature descriptors through the MOGP evolving and then evaluated by two objective fitness criteria, i.e., the classification error and the tree complexity. After the entire evolution procedure finishes, the best-so-far solution selected by the MOGP is regarded as the (near-)optimal feature descriptor obtained. To evaluate its performance, the proposed approach is systematically tested on the Caltech-101, the MIT urban and nature scene, the CMU PIE, and Jochen Triesch Static Hand Posture II data sets, respectively.

Compared to related methods that attempt to learn a single binary code serving both purposes, we demonstrate that choosing for two codes leads to more effective representations due to less concessions needed when balancing the requirements. The added value of using a unified framework compared to two separate frameworks lies in the synergy in data representation that is beneficial for both learning processes. When devising this framework, we also address another challenge in learning binary codes, namely that of learning supervision. While the most striking successes in image retrieval using binary codes have mostly involved discriminative models requiring labels, the proposed BGAN+ framework learns the binary codes in an unsupervised fashion, yet more effectively than the state-of-the-art supervised approaches.

Artificial neural network (ANN) models, Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models and Machine Learning models like Support Vector Regression, Bayesian Approaches and Hybrids models are used for prediction.

This paper investigate the similarity of solar radiation of similar days in different years and also implements one univariate and two multivariate similar day based linear models for short term solar power prediction. Similar days inputs are used prediction because, position of sun and earth is same corresponding to previous year similar day, only difference is cloud cover and cloud movement, wind speed and temperature. If we assume dependent factors will remain same with respect to previous years similar day, solar radiation will be same as previous years similar day values. Results obtained from these models shows that these models have strong potential for accurate real time solar power prediction and their accuracy can be enhanced by considering factors affecting solar irradiation.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/npsc.2016.7858914", "venue": "2016 National Power Systems Conference (NPSC)", "journal": "2016 National Power Systems Conference (NPSC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2588071057", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["108643268", "119410759", "33721330", "110829504", "124219700", "124434760", "59016783", "53447079", "12252828", "12274151", "120856083", "110442029", "96538337", "43083126", "18390702"], "inbound_citations": ["46858109"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:40824254"}

In this paper, individual classifiers are appropriately combined and a multiple classifier system with an increase in classification accuracy is presented. According to Breiman\u2019s methodology, we propose a multiple classifier system based on the Random Forest, Principle Component Analysis and Potential Nearest Neighbor methods As Breiman suggested, the performance of the Random Forest depends on the strength of the weak learners in the forests and diversity among them. The Principle Component Analysis method is applied to transform data at each node to another space when computing the best split at this node. This process increases the diversity of each tree in the forest and thereby improves the overall accuracy. The Random Forest is studied through the perspective of the Adaptive Nearest Neighbor. We introduce the concept of monotone distance measures and potential nearest neighbors and show that the Random Forest can be viewed as an adaptive learning mechanism of k Potential Nearest Neighbors. Considering the information loss caused by out-of-bag samples, a new voting mechanism based on Potential Nearest Neighbor is also presented to replace the traditional majority vote. The proposed algorithm improves the classification accuracy of the ensemble classifier by improving the difference of the base classifiers. The performance of the proposed method is compared with those of the Oblique Decision Tree Ensemble, Rotation Forest and basic Random Forest on the data sets. The experimental results show that the proposed method produces a better classification accuracy and lower variance. The proposed method is also applied to detect automobile insurance fraud, and the fraud rules are obtained.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.asoc.2017.07.027", "venue": "Appl.

It derives two 4-bit local binary patterns from two different layers for a pixel by comparing the gray color intensity value of the pixel with its neighboring pixels in four distinct directions. Since each face image is divided into equal sized blocks, two histograms for the two 4-bit LDGP patterns of all pixels in each block can be constructed.

ELM has reputation as eager classifier with fast training and testing time but the classification result originally has still low testing accuracy even by increasing the hidden nodes number and adding more training data. To achieve better accuracy, we pursue a feature selection method to reduce the dimension of pose cluster training data in time sequence. We propose to use frequency of pose occurrence. This method is similar like bag of words which is a sparse vector of occurrence counts of poses in histogram as features for training data (bag of poses).

Compared with pattern classification studies, pattern regression considers the problem of estimating continuous rather than categorical variables, and can be more challenging. It is also clinically important, since it can be used to estimate disease stage and predict clinical progression from images. In this work, adaptive regional feature extraction approach is used along with other common feature extraction methods, and feature selection technique is adopted to produce a small number of discriminative features for optimal regression performance. Then the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) is used to build regression models based on selected features. To get stable regression models from limited training samples, a bagging framework is adopted to build ensemble basis regressors derived from multiple bootstrap training samples, and thus to alleviate the effects of outliers as well as facilitate the optimal model parameter selection. Finally, this regression scheme is tested on simulated data and real data via cross-validation.

We proposed a method for drug repositioning which can predict simple and complex relationships between drugs, drug targets, and diseases. Since biological networks typically present a suitable model for relationships between different biological concepts, our primary approach is to analyze graphs and complex networks in the study of drugs and their therapeutic effects. Given the nature of existing data, the use of semi-supervised learning methods is crucial. So, in our research, we have developed a label propagation method to predict drug-target, drug-disease, and disease-target interactions (Heter-LP), which integrates various data sources at different levels. The predicted interactions are the most prominent relationships among the millions of relationships suggested to the related researchers for further investigation. The main advantages of Heter-LP are the effective integration of input data, eliminating the need for negative samples, and the use of local and global features together. The main steps of this research are as follows. The first step is the construction of a heterogeneous network as a data modeling task, in which data are collected and prepared. The second step is predicting potential interactions. We present a new label propagation algorithm for heterogeneous networks, which consists of two parts, one mapping and the other an iterative method for determining the final labels of the entire network vertices. Finally, for evaluation, we calculated the AUC and AUPR with tenfold cross-validation and compared the results with the best available methods for label propagation in heterogeneous networks and drug repositioning.

This phenomenon is labelled multiple causality . In contrast, a developmental disorder generated by a single underlying cognitive deficit may nevertheless show variable patterns of impairments due to individual differences. Connectionist computational models of development are used to investigate whether there may be ways to distinguish disorder groups with a single underlying cause (homogeneous disorder groups) from disorder groups with multiple underlying causes (heterogeneous disorder groups) on the basis of behavioural measures alone. A heuristic is proposed to assess the underlying causal homogeneity of the disorder group based on the variability of different behavioural measures from the target domain. Heterogeneous disorder groups are likely to show smaller variability on the measure used to define the disorder than on subsequent behavioural measures, while homogeneous groups should show approximately equivalent variability. Homogeneous disorder groups should show reductions in the variability of behavioural measures over time, while heterogeneous groups may not.

However, many of the enhancing voxels are associated with normal structures (i.e. blood vessels) or noise in the MRI, making the detection of gad-enhancing lesions a challenging task. Furthermore, these lesions are typically small and in close proximity to vessels. In this paper, we present an automatic, probabilistic Hierarchical Conditional Random Field (HCRF) framework for detection of gad-enhancing lesions in brain images of patients with MS. In the first level, a CRF with unary and pairwise potentials is used to identify candidate lesion voxel. In the second level, these lesion candidates are grouped based on anatomical and spatial features, and feature-specific lesion based CRF models are designed for each group. This lesion level CRF incorporates higher order potentials which account for shape, group intensities and symmetries. The proposed algorithm is trained on 92 multimodal clinical datasets acquired from Relapsing-Remitting MS patients during multicenter clinical trials and is evaluated on 30 independent cases. The experimental results show a sensitivity of 98%, a positive predictive value of 66% and an average false positive count of 1.55, outperforming the CRF and MRF frameworks proposed in [1].", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "23286071", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-33418-4_47", "venue": "Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

Our approach requires neither an explicit body model nor prior labelling of body parts in the image. Instead, it recovers pose by direct nonlinear regression against shape descriptor vectors extracted automatically from image silhouettes. For robustness against local silhouette segmentation errors, silhouette shape is encoded by histogram-of-shape-contexts descriptors. We evaluate several different regression methods: ridge regression, Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression over both linear and kernel bases. The RVMs provide much sparser regressors without compromising performance, and kernel bases give a small but worthwhile improvement in performance. Loss of depth and limb labelling information often makes the recovery of 3D pose from single silhouettes ambiguous. We propose two solutions to this: the first embeds the method in a tracking framework, using dynamics from the previous state estimate to disambiguate the pose; the second uses a mixture of regressors framework to return multiple solutions for each silhouette. We show that the resulting system tracks long sequences stably, and is also capable of accurately reconstructing 3D human pose from single images, giving multiple possible solutions in ambiguous cases. For realism and good generalization over a wide range of viewpoints, we train the regressors on images resynthesized from real human motion capture data. The method is demonstrated on a 54-parameter full body pose model, both quantitatively on independent but similar test data, and qualitatively on real image sequences.

However, the problem then becomes finding the appropriate kernel function. Multiple kernel learning addresses this limitation by learning a linear combination of a number of predefined kernels; this approach can be also readily used in the context of multiple-source learning to fuse different data sources. Surprisingly, and despite the extensive work on multiple kernel learning for SVMs, there has been no work in the area of metric learning with multiple kernel learning. In this paper we fill this gap and present a general approach for metric learning with multiple kernel learning.

The images were digitalized by a capture card and transferred to a personal computer for further analysis. Initially, images were converted from RGB color space to HSV color ones. For segmentation of the acquired images, H-component in the HSV color space and Otsu thresholding method were applied. A feature vector containing 30 color features was extracted from the captured images. A feature selection method based on sensitivity analysis was carried out to select superior features. The selected features were presented to SVM classifier. Various SVM models having a different kernel function were developed and tested. The SVM model having cubic polynomial kernel function and 38 support vectors achieved the best accuracy (99.17%) and then was selected to use in online decision-making unit of the system. By launching the online system, it was found that limiting factors of the system capacity were related to the hardware parts of the system (conveyor belt and pneumatic valves used in the sorting unit).

Social networking platforms have been an enormous medium for establishing relations and connections among different people all over the world. People, organizations and companies use these platforms to communicate and interact with their communities and audience. These platforms have made it easy for people to share information, create content, and communicate and connect with others online; however, online interaction and communication among people have resulted in the creation of many problems. Malicious contents can easily be shared and populated to reach a wider audience than by using the traditional sharing methods. Detection mechanism is a growing area of research that can detect any inappropriateness of data that is more sensitive to malicious behavior. The detection mechanism needs to be involved in the analysis of the abusing messages posted on the Twitter account of King Saud University (KSU). Text mining is one approach that can be used to detect such malicious or abusing messages. Text mining techniques provide the means to perform data classification where messages can be classified into malicious and non-malicious messages. In addition, Sentiment Analysis is used to identify user tendencies, trends, and opinions by classifying a text into positive, negative and neutral. In this paper, we aim to provide a literature review to investigate the current techniques. The study also addresses the detection of malicious messages which identifies the behavior of malicious and abusive messages. Based on the extensive review of the current techniques, our focus is on the analysis of Arabic and English tweets on KSU\u2019s Twitter account. First, data was collected from Twitter. This was followed by the preprocessing phase. Then, a corpus was produced applying a machine learning based approach by using Naive Bayes and Random Forest Classifier algorithms.

We discuss how sequentiality, the degree of consecutive matching class labels across instances, allows high accuracy without a classifier learning to differentiate classes. We propose a novel metric: lift-per-drift (lpd). This measures drift detection performance through its impact on classification accuracy, penalised by drifts detected in a dataset. This metric solves three problems: lpd cannot be increased by periodic, frequent drifts; lpd clearly shows when using drift detection increases classifier error; and lpd does not require knowledge of where real drifts occurred. We show how lpd can be set to be sensitive to the cost of each drift. Our experiments show lpd is not artificially increased through sequentiality; that lpd highlights when drift detection has caused a loss in accuracy; and that it is sensitive to change in true-positive drift and false-positive drift detection rates.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-03991-2_57", "venue": "Australasian Conference on Artificial Intelligence", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2899736427", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54440025"}

The GDR learns by performing gradient descent on the error surface in weight space whose height at any point is equal to a measure of the network's error. The GDR is plagued by two major problems. First, the progress towards a solution using the GDR is often quite slow. Second, networks employing the GDR frequently become trapped in local minima on the error surface and hence do not reach good solutions. To solve the problems of the GDR, a new connectionist architecture and learning algorithm is developed in this thesis. The new architectural components are called meta- connections, which are connections from a unit to the connection between two other units. Meta-connections are able to temporarily alter the weight of the connection to which they are connected. In doing this, meta-connections are able to tailor the weights of individual connections for particular input/output patterns. The new learning algorithm, called the meta-generalized delta rule (MGDR), is an extension of the GDR to provide for learning the proper weights for meta-connections. Empirical tests show that the tailoring of weights using meta-connections allows the MGDR to develop solutions more quickly and reliably than the GDR in a wide range of problems.", "year": 1987, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1488466553", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["6418767"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8352510"}

Recently, hyperspectral image compression has become an urgent issue for remote sensing applications. A lossy hyperspectral image compression scheme based on intra-band prediction and inter-band fractal encoding is put forward in this paper. The hyperspectral image is firstly partitioned into several groups of bands (GOBs). Intra-band prediction is applied to the first band in each GOB, exploiting spatial correlation, while inter-band fractal encoding with a local search algorithm is applied to the other bands in each GOB, making use of the local similarity between two adjacent bands. The fractal parameters are signed Exp-Golomb entropy encoded. To improve the decoded quality, the prediction error and fractal residual are further transformed, quantized, and entropy encoded. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed scheme can obtain a better compression performance with low complexity compared with other well-known methods.

However, RF is doubly random. Many (e.g., 500) weak trees are grown (trained) independently because each tree is trained with a new randomly selected bootstrap sample, and a random subset of variables is used to split each node. To train and validate the RF trees, 561 soil descriptions were made in the field. An additional 111 points were added by case-based reasoning using photo interpretation. As RF makes classification decisions from the mode of many independently grown trees, model uncertainty can be derived. Furthermore, the probability that a pixel belongs to one or more classes in the legend can be determined. The overall out of the bag (OOB) error for discrete classes was 55.2%. The confusion matrix revealed that four soils that frequently co-occurred on landforms were frequently misclassified as each other. These soils were combined into six soil map units.

In recent years there has been a shift in the field of affect recognition from \u201cin the lab\u201d experiments with acted data to \u201cin the wild\u201d experiments with spontaneous and naturalistic data. Two major issues thereby are the proper segmentation of the input and adequate description and modeling of affective states. The first issue is crucial for responsive, real-time systems such as virtual agents and robots, where the latency of the analysis must be as small as possible. To address this issue we introduce a novel method of incremental segmentation to be used in combination with supra-segmental modeling. For modeling of continuous affective states we use Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks, with which we can show an improvement in performance over standard recurrent neural networks and feed-forward neural networks as well as Support Vector Regression. For experiments we use the SEMAINE database, which contains recordings of spontaneous and natural human to Wizard-of-Oz conversations. The recordings are annotated continuously in time and magnitude with FeelTrace for five affective dimensions, namely activation, expectation, intensity, power/dominance, and valence. To exploit dependencies between the five affective dimensions we investigate multitask learning of all five dimensions augmented with inter-rater standard deviation. We can show improvements for multitask over single-task modeling. Correlation coefficients of up to 0.81 are obtained for the activation dimension and up to 0.58 for the valence dimension. The performance for the remaining dimensions were found to be in between that for activation and valence.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/2133366.2133372", "venue": "TIIS", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2024289965,2755655211", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["8603870", "13920681", "12923007", "6177301", "961425", "122050980", "5962753", "543782", "141285976", "305265", "8726667", "13940224", "14180535", "1779061", "207146090", "17641251", "10352688", "1856462", "2909323", "785709", "1222436", "59776165", "17278462", "1915014", "6088557", "4997662", "9903828", "16502855", "13626757", "12864007", "2970361", "12341566", "1064898", "14540873", "16848428", "17609995", "205397338", "12447453", "10547600", "8287933", "14143658", "1737279", "3254362", "7109758", "15982909", "1901706", "40687110", "18375389", "27397944", "15825494", "20467143", "13226793", "14753034", "18470994", "140109802", "12469750", "8548353", "15906391", "11717268", "11822764", "2192817", "20035513", "584690"], "inbound_citations": ["13162229", "6650994", "6885470", "10613648", "206918948", "198229728", "23726677", "52286482", "88517536", "34001469", "209503386", "10065140", "23534366", "209531910", "18364179", "11434456", "181651938", "954882", "52274917"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2224122"}

Moreover, the learner will require creating a balance between generalization and denoising abilities and regularization of the complexity as well. The Support Vector Clustering (SVC) approach, though globally informative, lacks mechanisms to take advantage of the inferences made from local statistics. Parameterizing the algorithm and embedding local methods is still an open problem in the SVC algorithm. In this chapter, the unsupervised support vector method for clustering is studied.

Semi-supervised learning addresses this issue by self-labeling unlabelled examples. Transfer learning tackles it from a different way: borrow labeled examples from a different but related domain (source domain) by assigning weights to those examples based on their suitability on the new domain (target domain). However, it is quite challenging to figure out the suitability. In this paper, we propose a different way for utilizing the labeled examples from source domain. That is, we use them only for labelling the unlabelled examples in the target domain. In this self-labelling, we use the idea of Tri-training. We call our new algorithm: TriTransfer. In TriTransfer, three initial classifiers are generated from the source data and the originally labeled data in the target domain, and an unlabeled example is labeled and added to the labeled data for a classifier if other two classifiers agree on its label.

In order to construct a simple and reliable classifier, learning an adequate distance metric from a given HSI dataset is still a critical and challenging task in many HSI applications. In this paper, a novel distance metric learning (DML) framework based on 1-D manifold embedding (1DME), named DL1DME, is proposed for HSI classification. The 1DME framework was developed by using the recently developed smooth ordering technique. This framework enables us to elaborately exploit the benefits of DML in the development of the 1DME algorithm. The core of the state-of-the-art DML is to learn a Mahalanobis matrix from the given dataset that better describes the similarity between pixels. Largest margin nearest neighbors (LMNN) and information theoretic metric learning (ITML) are employed for the Mahalanobis matrix learning. Then, based on the affinity defined by the Mahalanobis matrix, the preclassifiers are constructed using the simple 1-D regularization on 1DME; and they predict the labels of the test data. By a voting rule, the pixels labeled in the same class by most of the preclassifiers are voted into the confidently predicted set, which are then merged with the current labeled set. The labeled set enlargement process is repeated if the original one has a very small size. The final classifier is then constructed in the 1DME framework again, but based on the enlarged labeled set. According to the aforementioned strategy, two novel DML-based 1DME classification algorithms, DL1DME-LMNN and DL1DME-ITML, are developed in this paper. Experimental results on three popular real-world HSIs demonstrate that the classification performance of the proposed DL1DME is superior to other most popular SSL methods in terms of classification accuracies.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2657600", "venue": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2587896339", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["346860", "32183317", "9129054", "6906514", "14495716", "4641916", "8316147", "14173829", "17347221", "202503", "4629520", "29808774", "93723", "38654338", "15084197", "3194475", "3085883", "8206579", "35893011", "19806748", "43846694", "47325215", "15078489", "15773943", "14516427", "15773943", "303727", "19984061"], "inbound_citations": ["56718104", "53019522", "53208640"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:25389737"}

When modeling gridded population, the information used for training the model may differ in spatial resolution than what is produced by the model prediction. This case arises when approaching population modeling from a top-down, dasymetric approach in which one redistributes coarse administrative unit level population data (i.e., source unit) to a finer scale (i.e., target unit). However, often overlooked are issues associated with the differing variance across the scale, spatial autocorrelation and bias in sampling techniques. In this study, we examine the effects of intentionally biasing our sampling from the source to target scale within the context of a weighted, dasymetric mapping approach. The weighted component is based on a Random Forest estimator, which is a non-parametric ensemble-based prediction model. We investigate issues of autocorrelation and heterogeneity in the training data using 18 different types of samples to show the variations in training, census-level (i.e., source) and output, grid-level (i.e., target) predictions. We compare results to simple random sampling and geographically stratified random sampling. Results indicate that the Random Forest model is sensitive to the spatial autocorrelation inherent in the training data, which leads to an increase in the variance of the residuals. Sample training datasets that are at a spatial scale representative of the true population produced the best fitting models. However, the true representative dataset varied in autocorrelation for both scales. More attention is needed with ensemble-based learning and spatially-heterogeneous data as underlying issues of spatial autocorrelation influence results for both the census-level and grid-level estimations.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2019.01.006", "venue": "Comput.

Medical organizations started to share their information about newly developed drugs through social media. It provides flexible platform for millions users to share their opinions about the newly developed drugs.

Analyzing various kind of drugs information posted by the millions of users is a most difficult task which is researched by various authors. In the existing work, two-step analysis framework is implemented which focuses on positive and negative sentiment extraction. It is done for the purpose of ascertaining user opinion of cancer treatment. It is done by using a self-organizing map to analyze word frequency data derived from users' forum posts. However in the existing system is a static model where only the older posts that are posted by the users online previously are considered which might lead to less accurate detection of consumer opinions. It utilizes only static dictionary about the drugs where the newly introduced drugs cannot be identified. This problem is resolved in the proposed research method namely Dynamic Drug Data Analysis using Hybrid Transductive Support Vector Machine with Fuzzy C Means algorithm (DDDA-HTSVM-FCM) by focusing on user opinions from the user reviews to refine the product based on user opinions. This is implemented in the social media framework where more number of consumers post their reviews based on the drug product. In the proposed research twitter social network is considered for retrieving the user posted opinions. The main goal of the proposed research work is to support the dynamic retrieval of data from the twitter social web site from which drugs related information would be identified.

The reconstruction model implemented the Random Forests (RF) regression algorithm to simulate the relationships between soil moisture and environmental variables, and takes advantages of the high spatial resolution of optical remote sensing products: the data gaps of ECV soil moisture products were firstly filled by the estimation model trained using available pixels of the ECV products and corresponding environmental variables; then a spatial downscaling was carried out to the gap-filled ECV products to obtain the reconstructed soil moisture with fine spatial resolution (0.05\u00b0). As a result, the reconstructed soil moisture well fill the data gaps of the original ECV products and nicely reproduced the original soil moisture values (R2 > 0.98). The spatial resolution and variation details of the soil moisture products were also improved significantly. Validation results indicated that the reconstructed soil moisture showed comparable good performance (average R2 = 0.66) as the original ECV products (average R2 = 0.65) and nicely reflect the temporal behavior of ground-based measurements.

The proposed hybrid learning approach is designed based on supervised and unsupervised learning techniques that considers the local association of adjacent pixels of the satellite images. Hybridization of clustering, soft labeling using fuzzy logic, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) are used in change detection. Radial Basis Function (RBF) is used as the kernel function in SVM, and the RBF kernel parameters such as C and \u03c3 are optimized using GA for additional improvement of the performance. To demonstrate the efficiency of the approach, tests are performed on two satellite images captured in two different time instances on a particular geographical area.

The sensing is based on the principle of total internal reflection (TIR) of light. CP-TIS will estimate mechanical properties such as size and elasticity of the embedded objects (e.g. tumor). Based on the mechanical properties determined by TIS, it is possible to generate a malignancy score, since studies have shown that malignant tumors tend to be larger and stiffer. Clinical Breast Examination (CBE) is one of the qualitative techniques used by doctors for early detection of breast tumors. However, this method is effective only in detecting lesions, but not in classifying tumor malignancy. Also this is a subjective method where the performance depends on how the doctors perform CBE. Therefore, it is advantageous to quantify the mechanical properties of a tumor for objective tumor identification. Fig. 1 shows a schematic of CP-TIS. The system consists of physical and cyber components. In the physical component, there are 1, 2,..., N number of TIS with operators, laptops, and targets. The TIS includes an optical sensing probe made of Polydimethylsiloxane, a light source unit made of four light emitting diodes, a camera unit, a computer unit, a force gauge unit, as shown in Fig 2. Due to the TIR, the system does not detect anything until the contours of the sensing probe changes. However, light scatters and our TIS will capture this image when the pressure is applied to the probe. The operators use TIS on the target to capture tactile images. The images are transferred to cyber component of the system for processing and analyzing through a communication network such as Wi-Fi. The images are processed and mechanical properties are estimated in the computation unit. This information is stored in a database with patient information. Then we compute malignancy score using Machine Learning Algorithm such as Support Vector Machine. The score helps the doctors and patients to decide whether to seek further medical help. In this demonstration, a prototype TIS will be shown. A direct contact experiment was performed on various phantoms to capture tactile images. The images were then processed and analyzed to estimate size and elasticity. The phantoms were made of silicone, silicone rubber, and Polyvinyl Chloride-Plastisol (PVC-Plastisol). In the laboratory environment, the relative errors for size estimation were found to be at least 3.57% for the silicone phantom, 1.82% for the PVC-Plastisol phantom, and 0.90% for the silicone rubber. The relative errors for elasticity estimation were found to be 4.83% for the PVC-Plastisol phantom, and 5.50% for the silicone rubber. A pilot clinical study was conducted on twenty breast cancer patients in Temple University Hospital following the IRB protocol no. 13661. The estimated elasticity was correlated with the biopsy results. Preliminary results show that a sensitivity of 66.70% and a specificity of 91.70% for elasticity.

By extracting frequency domain maximum points to adaptively split the Fourier spectrum to separate different modalities. Then, a band-pass filter bank is adaptively constructed in the frequency domain to construct an orthogonal wavelet function to extract an AM-FM component with a Compact Support Fourier spectrum to better extract fault features. At the same time combining the advantages of SVM in small sample classification and identification, a fault diagnosis model based on EWT and SVM is proposed.

To this end, we propose a Face Normalization Model (FNM) to generate a frontal, neutral expression, photorealistic face image for face recognition. FNM is a well-designed Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with three distinct novelties. First, a face expert network is introduced to construct generator and provide the ability of retaining face identity. Second, with the reconstruction of normal face, pixel-wise loss is applied to stabilize optimization process. Third, we present a series of face attention discriminators to refine local textures.

Since human cognition is not optimized to work well in high-dimensional spaces, these areas could benefit from interpretable low-dimensional representations. However, most representation learning algorithms for time series data are difficult to interpret. This is due to non-intuitive mappings from data features to salient properties of the representation and non-smoothness over time. To address this problem, we propose a new representation learning framework building on ideas from interpretable discrete dimensionality reduction and deep generative modeling. This framework allows us to learn discrete representations of time series, which give rise to smooth and interpretable embeddings with superior clustering performance. We introduce a new way to overcome the non-differentiability in discrete representation learning and present a gradient-based version of the traditional self-organizing map algorithm that is more performant than the original. Furthermore, to allow for a probabilistic interpretation of our method, we integrate a Markov model in the representation space. This model uncovers the temporal transition structure, improves clustering performance even further and provides additional explanatory insights as well as a natural representation of uncertainty. We evaluate our model in terms of clustering performance and interpretability on static (Fashion-)MNIST data, a time series of linearly interpolated (Fashion-)MNIST images, a chaotic Lorenz attractor system with two macro states, as well as on a challenging real world medical time series application on the eICU data set.

The integration of these data using computational approaches is potentially useful for predicting metagenomic functions. Machine learning (ML) models can be trained using microbial features which are then used to classify microbial data into different functional classes. For example, ML analyses over the human microbiome data has been linked to the prediction of important biological states. For analysing omics data, integrating abundance count of taxonomical features with their biological relationships is important. These relationships can potentially be uncovered from the phylogenetic tree of microbial taxa. In this paper, we propose a novel integrative framework Phy-PMRFI. This framework is driven by the phylogeny-based modeling of omics data to predict metagenomic functions using important features selected by a random forest importance (RFI) strategy. The proposed framework integrates the underlying phylogenetic tree information with abundance measures of microbial species (features) by creating a novel phylogeny and abundance aware matrix structure (PAAM). Phy-PMRFI progresses by ranking the microbial features using an RFI measure. This is then used as input for microbiome classification. The resultant feature set enhances the performance of the state-of-art methods such as support vector machines. Our proposed integrative framework also outperforms the state-of-the-art pipeline of phylogenetic isometric log-ratio transform (PhILR) and MetaPhyl.

However, it remains challenging for 3D landmark localization due to the lack of annotated datasets and the ambiguous nature of landmarks under the 3D perspective. This paper revisits regression-based methods and proposes an adversarial voxel and coordinate regression framework for 2D and 3D facial landmark localization in real-world scenarios. First, a semantic volumetric representation is introduced to encode the per-voxel likelihood of positions being the 3D landmarks. Then, an end-to-end pipeline is designed to jointly regress the proposed volumetric representation and the coordinate vector. Such a pipeline not only enhances the robustness and accuracy of the predictions but also unifies the 2D and 3D landmark localization so that the 2D and 3D datasets could be utilized simultaneously.

In this paper, we present a novel change detection framework for high-resolution remote sensing images, which incorporates superpixel-based change feature extraction and hierarchical difference representation learning by neural networks. First, highly homogenous and compact image superpixels are generated using superpixel segmentation, which makes these image blocks adhere well to image boundaries. Second, the change features are extracted to represent the difference information using spectrum, texture, and spatial features between the corresponding superpixels. Third, motivated by the fact that deep neural network has the ability to learn from data sets that have few labeled data, we use it to learn the semantic difference between the changed and unchanged pixels. The labeled data can be selected from the bitemporal multispectral images via a preclassification map generated in advance. And then, a neural network is built to learn the difference and classify the uncertain samples into changed or unchanged ones. Finally, a robust and high-contrast change detection result can be obtained from the network.

When the labeled information in a target domain is limited, transfer metric learning (TML) helps to learn the metric by leveraging the sufficient information from other related domains. Multitask metric learning (MTML), which can be regarded as a special case of TML, performs transfer across all related domains. Current TML tools usually assume that the same feature representation is exploited for different domains. However, in real-world applications, data may be drawn from heterogeneous domains. Heterogeneous transfer learning approaches can be adopted to remedy this drawback by deriving a metric from the learned transformation across different domains. However, they are often limited in that only two domains can be handled. To appropriately handle multiple domains, we develop a novel heterogeneous MTML (HMTML) framework. In HMTML, the metrics of all different domains are learned together. The transformations derived from the metrics are utilized to induce a common subspace, and the high-order covariance among the predictive structures of these domains is maximized in this subspace. There do exist a few heterogeneous transfer learning approaches that deal with multiple domains, but the high-order statistics (correlation information), which can only be exploited by simultaneously examining all domains, is ignored in these approaches. Compared with them, the proposed HMTML can effectively explore such high-order information, thus obtaining more reliable feature transformations and metrics.

Participants were men referred for a trans-rectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy because of an elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) level or abnormal findings on digital rectal examination. Urine samples were collected from patients with prostate cancer (n = 59) and cancer-free controls (n = 43), on the day of their biopsy, prior to their procedure. VOCs from the headspace of basified urine samples were extracted using solid-phase micro-extraction and analysed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Classifiers were developed using Random Forest (RF) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classification techniques. PSA alone had an accuracy of 62\u201364% in these samples. A model based on 4 VOCs, 2,6-dimethyl-7-octen-2-ol, pentanal, 3-octanone, and 2-octanone, was marginally more accurate 63\u201365%. When combined, PSA level and these four VOCs had mean accuracies of 74% and 65%, using RF and LDA, respectively. With repeated double cross-validation, the mean accuracies fell to 71% and 65%, using RF and LDA, respectively. Results from VOC profiling of urine headspace are encouraging and suggest that there are other metabolomic avenues worth exploring which could help improve the stratification of men at risk of prostate cancer.

One way to tackle this problem is to introduce a linear loss function over the errors and a penalty on the magnitude of model coefficients. This leads to qualities such as robustness to outliers and avoidance of the problem of overfitting. This kind of estimation forms the basis of the SVR technique, which, as we will argue, makes it a good candidate for estimating the Market Share Attraction Model. We test the SVR approach to predict (the evolution of) the market shares of 36 car brands simultaneously and report promising results.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1080/07474938.2010.481989", "venue": null, "journal": "Econometric Reviews", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2143008228,2111119598", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["194951", "167172480", "60486887", "59035923", "121252793", "11225382", "9456418", "6636078", "17534825", "59853377", "15480929", "119999370", "16162039", "121508623", "117643475", "7138354"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17796343"}

Detecting the effective channels in BCI systems is an important problem in reducing the complexity of these systems. In this research, Improved Binary Gravitation Search Algorithm (IBGSA) is used to automatically detect the effective electroencephalography (EEG) channels in left or right hand classification. To do this, at first, data is filtered with a bandpass filter in order to reduce the amount of different types of merged noise. Then, the electrooculography (EOG) and electromyography (EMG) artifacts are corrected based on Blind Source Separation (BSS) algorithm. Data is epoched according to the left or right hand motor imageries and central beta frequency band is isolated for Event Related Synchronization (ERS) analysis. Feature extraction process is carried out by analyzing EEG signals in time and wavelet domains. The logarithmic power of each channel is computed in time domain and the features of mean, mode, median, variance, and standard deviation are calculated in wavelet domain. IBGSA is employed to detect the optimal channels to achieve better classification results. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used as the classifier.

Existing methods usually treat knowledge representation as characteristic information for addressing data sparsity and cold start issues.

Thus, we believe that it is crucial to incorporate both relations and attributes of users and items into recommender system. That can better capture the extent that a user prefer to an item. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge graph-based temporal recommendation (KGTR) model. Firstly, we design a lightweight KG on the basis of a single independent domains knowledge without extra supplement. We define three relationships to express interactions within/between users and items, including the interaction of a user browsing an item, the social relation of two users browsing one item, and the behavior of a user browsing items in the meantime. Different from previous knowledge translation-based recommendation methods, we embed interactions by adding them to the transformation from one entity to another in KG.

In this paper, we propose a co-evolutionary multilabel hypernetwork (Co-MLHN) as an attempt to exploit label correlations in an effective and efficient way. To this end, we firstly convert the traditional hypernetwork into a multilabel hypernetwork (MLHN) where label correlations are explicitly represented. We then propose a co-evolutionary learning algorithm to learn an integrated classification model for all labels. The proposed Co-MLHN exploits arbitrary order label correlations and has linear computational complexity with respect to the number of labels.

Training data selection and specific input variables (i.e., image channels) have a large impact on the overall accuracy of the image classification. High-dimension datasets should be reduced so that only uncorrelated important variables are used in classifications.

This is because most methods use spectral or texture information, which are not sufficient for detecting complex shapes. In this paper, a new detection framework, based on Spatial Pyramid Matching (SPM) and Locality- constraint Linear Coding (LLC), is proposed to solve this problem, and exemplified using airplane shapes. The process starts with partitioning the image into sub-regions and generating a unique histogram for local features of each sub-region. Then, linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are used to detect objects based on a pyramid-matching kernel, which analyses the descriptors inside patches in different resolution. In order to generate the histogram, first a point feature detector (e.g. SIFT) is applied on the patches, and then a quantization process is used to select local features. In this step, the k-mean method is used in conjunction with the locality-constrained linear coding method. The LLC forces the coefficient matrix in the quantization process to be local and sparse as well. As a result, the speed of the method improves around 24 times in comparison to using sparse coding for quantization. Quantitative analysis also shows improvement in comparison to just using k-mean, but the accuracy in comparison to using sparse coding is similar. Rotation and shift of the desired object has no effect on the obtained results. The speed and accuracy of this algorithm for high spatial resolution images make it capable for use in real-world applications.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1088/1755-1315/34/1/012030", "venue": "IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science", "journal": "IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science", "mag_id": "2384081408", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:124422536"}

An accurate sales volume forecasting is the key to the entire budgeting process. All of the other parts of the master budget are dependent on the sales volume forecasting in some way. If the sales volume forecasting is sloppily done, then the rest of the budgeting process is largely a waste of time. Therefore, the sales volume forecasting process is a critical one for most businesses, and also a difficult area of management. Most of researches and companies use the statistical methods, regression analysis, or sophisticated computer simulations to analyze the sales volume forecasting. Recently, various prediction Artificial Intelligent (AI) techniques have been proposed in forecasting. Support Vector Regression (SVR) has been applied successfully to solve problems in numerous fields and proved to be a better prediction model. However, the select of appropriate SVR parameters is difficult. Therefore, to improve the accuracy of SVR, a hybrid intelligent support system based on evolutionary computation to solve the difficulties involved with the parameters selection is presented in this research.

The methodology proposed in this paper for fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings, utilizes autocorrelation of raw vibration signals to reduce the dimension of vibration signals with minimal loss of significant frequency content. Dimension of vibration signal is reduced to 10% with negligible loss of information. To extract most appropriate features from auto-correlated vibration signals and for effective classification of faults, vibration signals are decomposed using complex Gaussian wavelet. Total 150 signals of healthy and defective bearings at rotor speeds 250, 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 rpm with three loading conditions are considered. 1-D continuous wavelet coefficients of these samples are calculated at the seventh level of decomposition (27 scales for each sample). Maximum Energy to Shannon Entropy ration criterion is used to determine scale corresponding to characteristic defect frequency. Statistical features are extracted from the wavelet coefficients corresponding to selected scales. Finally, bearing faults are classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM) method. The test results show that the SVM can be used efficiently for bearing fault classification.

This information can provide soldiers, security personnel, and search and rescue workers with critical knowledge that can be used to potentially save lives and/or avoid a dangerous situation. Most research involving human activity recognition is focused on using the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) as a method of analyzing the micro-Doppler signatures. Because of the time-frequency resolution limitations of the STFT and because Fourier transform-based methods are not well-suited for use with non-stationary and nonlinear signals, we have chosen a different approach. Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) has been shown to be a valuable time-frequency method for processing non-stationary and nonlinear data such as micro-Doppler signatures and EMD readily provides a feature vector that can be utilized for classification. For classification, the method of a Support Vector Machine (SVMs) was chosen. SVMs have been widely used as a method of pattern recognition due to their ability to generalize well and also because of their moderately simple implementation. In this paper, we discuss the ability of these methods to accurately identify human movements based on their micro-Doppler signatures obtained from S-band and millimeter-wave radar systems. Comparisons will also be made based on experimental results from each of these radar systems. Furthermore, we will present simulations of micro-Doppler movements for stationary subjects that will enable us to compare our experimental Doppler data to what we would expect from an \"ideal\" movement.\u00a9 (2012) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

To address this challenge, a double-sampling scheme is proposed to generate triplets of images as effective as possible. The proposed framework is evaluated on several benchmark datasets.

In the second stage, classification based on smooth surfaces and rough surfaces is performed. Points in the smooth surfaces are first classified into ground and buildings based on semantic rules. Next, features of rough surfaces are extracted. Then, points in rough surfaces are classified into vegetation and vehicles based on the derived features and Random Forests (RF). In the third stage, point-based features are extracted for the ground points, and then, an individual point classification procedure is performed to classify the ground points into bare land, artificial ground and greenbelt. Moreover, the shortages of the existing studies are analyzed, and experiments show that the proposed method overcomes these shortages and handles more types of objects.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-2-W7-837-2017", "venue": null, "journal": "ISPRS - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2755380397", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": ["122067149", "38462674", "63752237", "123045957", "124253381", "14577182", "24576082", "63256324", "1763374", "87613457", "120135390", "89141", "129933795", "3158358", "6550443", "161550", "3198717", "121865314", "121517275"], "inbound_citations": ["85498924"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55888622"}

However, one of the key design requirements in building an interpretable fuzzy model is that each obtained rule consequent must match well with the system local behavior when all the rules are aggregated to produce the overall system output. This is one of the distinctive characteristics from black-box models such as neural networks. Therefore, how to find a desirable set of fuzzy partitions and, hence, identify the corresponding consequent models which can be directly explained in terms of system behavior, presents a critical step in fuzzy neural modeling. In this paper, a new learning approach considering both nonlinear parameters in the rule premises and linear parameters in the rule consequents is proposed. Unlike the conventional two-stage optimization procedure widely practiced in the field where the two sets of parameters are optimized separately, the consequent parameters are transformed into a dependent set on the premise parameters, thereby enabling the introduction of a new integrated gradient descent learning approach. Thus, a new Jacobian matrix is proposed and efficiently computed to achieve a more accurate approximation of the cost function by using the second-order Levenberg-Marquardt optimization method. Several other interpretability issues regarding the fuzzy neural model are also discussed and integrated into this new learning approach. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the resultant structure of the fuzzy neural models and the effectiveness of the proposed new algorithm, and compared with the results from some well-known methods.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TFUZZ.2012.2200900", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1979063736", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["9422169", "30016341", "14697292", "14517617", "12774329", "2720704", "12342523", "32528294", "6691411", "2883719", "6868620", "3333100", "22952090", "21177440", "431888", "38498895", "25296549", "53935569", "13096847", "30806637", "17534236", "11000681", "37530289", "14345934", "207702091", "122250362", "39920442", "7859262", "15550399", "5101428", "7847748", "1078340", "28468592", "120914275", "17203395", "8378762", "15681183", "2763095", "3117315", "118989214", "120907742", "14335673", "8871817", "7661188"], "inbound_citations": ["53581276", "19590317", "22568588", "12360391", "24530304", "17792865", "51613892", "17894284", "211017303", "20910703", "10364167", "54747041", "50782704", "26547611", "7875398", "11531941", "10774447", "6183589"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8446795"}

SVM discretizes the continuous variables of medical image features by classifying them into finite states as middle-level semantics.

To validate the method, a model is built to achieve automatic image annotation at the content level from a small set of astrocytona MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) samples. Multi-level annotation is a promising solution to enable medical image retrieval at different semantic levels.

Although effects of climate and geological history on species richness have been widely explored, their relative contribution among common and rare species is poorly understood. Here, using a valuable ornamental plant family Gesneriaceae, we evaluated how contemporary climate, habitat heterogeneity and long-term climate change affect the distribution of rare and common species. Additionally, we identified hotspots of Gesneriaceae diversity and evaluated its protection gap in China. ::: ::: Location ::: China. ::: ::: Methods ::: Distribution of Gesneriaceae was compiled at a spatial resolution of 50 \u00d7 50 km. Species were grouped as rare and common based on the number of grid cells they occupied, and their richness patterns and hotspots were estimated separately. Generalized linear models and Random Forest were used to compare effects of different factors on species richness. ::: ::: Results ::: Richness of Gesneriaceae peaked in south-western China. The Yunnan\u2013Guizhou Plateau and Hengduan Mountains were identified as hotspots for overall and common species, while only the former was hotspot for rare species. Temperature seasonality, winter coldness and temperature change since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) dominated species richness patterns, but their relative effects differed between species range size. Temperature seasonality had strongest effects on richness of common species, whereas temperature change since the LGM was strongest for rare species. Neither current nor past precipitation affects richness patterns significantly. ::: ::: Main conclusions ::: Gesneriaceae species richness is strongly influenced by temperature changes. Specifically, rare and common species are primarily dominated by long- and short-term temperature changes, respectively. These findings suggest that most Gesneriaceae species may face high risk under future climate changes, and hence, more conservation efforts are urgently needed, especially in Yunnan\u2013Guizhou Plateau, which is hotspot of rare species.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1111/ddi.12523", "venue": null, "journal": "Diversity and Distributions", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2567499138", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["8817724", "55037081", "87232864", "28472403", "130498809", "11510125", "56429256", "5481398", "84850448", "83187545", "120382860", "8221460", "122072468", "18203782", "126647311", "117866366", "84044344", "83994689", "84021948", "4805699", "90113730", "6846678", "9684372", "14578866", "83478787", "84530681", "24665620", "2272755", "86232574", "146014357", "87785109", "88196717", "4419902", "4402270", "53629746", "10426425", "6875642", "1190097", "43018111", "40145348", "73700416", "43530396", "85211595", "84158740", "4458927", "54516648", "86135042", "132841788", "35986955", "83831085", "73575286", "17383353", "85690511", "58893877"], "inbound_citations": ["52271343", "155093568", "90308220", "53693944"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3944240"}

Solar and geomagnetic activity indices and their chaotic characteristics vary abruptly during solar and geomagnetic storms. This variation depicts the difficulties in modeling and long-term prediction of solar and geomagnetic storms. On the other hand, the combination of neurofuzzy models and spectral analysis has been a subject of interest due to their many practical applications in modeling and predicting complex phenomena. However, these approaches should be trained by algorithms that need to be carried out by an offline data set, which influences their performance in online modeling and prediction of time-varying phenomena. This paper proposes an adaptive approach for multi-step ahead prediction of space weather indices by extending the regular singular spectrum analysis and locally linear neurofuzzy models to adaptive approaches. The combination of these recursive approaches fulfills requirements of long-term prediction of solar and geomagnetic activity indices.

Clinical exams are typically poorly temporally characterized, as seen in a low temporal resolution (LTR) compared to high temporal resolution (HTR) experimental acquisitions. Meanwhile, clinical demands incentivize shortening these exams. This study develops a neural network based approach to quantification of k1 , for increased robustness over current models such as the linearized single-input, two-compartment (LSITC) model. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: 30 Liver HTR DCE MRI exams were acquired in 22 patients with at least 16 minutes of post-contrast data sampled at least every 13 seconds. A simple neural network (NN) with 4 hidden layers was trained on voxel-wise LTR data to predict k1 . LTR data was created by subsampling HTR data to contain 6 time points, replicating the characteristics of clinical LTR data. Both the total length and the placement of points in the training data was varied considerably to encourage robustness to variation. A GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) was used to generate arterial and portal venous inputs for use in data augmentation based on the dual-input, two-compartment, pharmacokinetic model of gadoxetic acid in the liver. The performance of the NN was compared to direct application of LSITC on both LTR and HTR data. The error was assessed when subsampling lengths from 16 to 4 minutes, enabling assessment of robustness to acquisition length. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: For acquisition lengths of 16 min NRMSE (Normalized Root-Mean-Squared Error) in k1 was 0.60, 1.77, and 1.21, for LSITC applied to HTR data, LSITC applied to LTR data, and GAN augmented NN applied to LTR data, respectively. As the acquisition length was shortened, errors greatly increased for LSITC approaches by several folds. For acquisitions shorter than 12 minutes the GAN augmented NN approach outperformed the LSITC approach to a statistically significant extent, even with HTR data. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: The study indicates that data length is significant for LSITC analysis as applied to DCE data for standard temporal sampling, and that machine learning methods, such as the implemented NN, have potential for much greater resilience to shortened acquisition time than directly fitting to the LSITC model.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31997391", "doi": "10.1002/mp.14055", "venue": "Medical physics", "journal": "Medical physics", "mag_id": "3003735556", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210947138"}

However, the existing metric learning methods usually use a fixed L2-norm to measure the distance between pairwise data samples in the projection space, which cannot provide an effective mechanism to automatically remove the noise that exist in data samples. To address this issue, we propose a new robust formulation of metric learning. Our new model constructs a projection from higher dimensional Grassmann manifold into the one in a relative low-dimensional with more discriminative capability, where the errors between sample points are considered as an MLE (maximum likelihood estimation)-like estimator. An efficient iteratively reweighted algorithm is derived to solve the proposed metric learning model. More importantly, we establish the generalization bounds for the proposed algorithm by utilizing the techniques of U-statistics.

In this paper, we present a new application in rudder fault test by using machine learning technology and recommend a new intelligent method for fault location. The main subject revolves around prediction-oriented problems of multi-dimensional performance parameters data mining and the modeling of classification, including the analysis and processing of data features and the solution of fault location based on classification model. In addition, to improve the accuracy of the classification model, we optimized the random forest (RF) algorithm with the shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA), which we call shuffled frog leaping algorithm-based random forest (SFLA-RF). It effectively solves the problem of voting competition among each tree, which makes the decision of the model more efficient and accurate.

This underlies the need of computational and bioinformatics approach to solve the problem. Large and organized latent knowledge on protein classification exists in the form of independently created protein classification databases. By creating probabilistic maps between classes of structural classification databases (e.g. SCOP) and classes of functional classification databases (e.g. PROSITE), structure and function of proteins could be probabilistically related. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: We demonstrate that PROSITE and SCOP have significant semantic overlap, in spite of independent classification schemes. By training classifiers of SCOP using classes of PROSITE as attributes and vice versa, accuracy of Support Vector Machine classifiers for both SCOP and PROSITE was improved. Novel attributes, 2-D elastic profiles and Blocks were used to improve time complexity and accuracy. Many relationships were extracted between classes of SCOP and PROSITE using decision trees. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: We demonstrate that presented approach can discover new probabilistic relationships between classes of different taxonomies and render a more accurate classification. Extensive mappings between existing protein classification databases can be created to link the large amount of organized data. Probabilistic maps were created between classes of SCOP and PROSITE allowing predictions of structure using function, and vice versa.

To search systematically for protein fold signatures, we have explored the use of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). ILP is a machine learning technique which derives rules from observation and encoded principles. The derived rules are readily interpreted in terms of concepts used by experts. For 20 populated folds in SCOP, 59 rules were found automatically. The accuracy of these rules, which is defined as the number of true positive plus true negative over the total number of examples, is 74% (cross-validated value). Further analysis was carried out for 23 signatures covering 30% or more positive examples of a particular fold. The work showed that signatures of protein folds exist, about half of rules discovered automatically coincide with the level of fold in the SCOP classification. Other signatures correspond to homologous family and may be the consequence of a functional requirement. Examination of the rules shows that many correspond to established principles published in specific literature. However, in general, the list of signatures is not part of standard biological databases of protein patterns. We find that the length of the loops makes an important contribution to the signatures, suggesting that this is an important determinant of the identity of protein folds.

{"paper_id": "3995652", "title": "Secure Learning and Learning for Security: . . .", "authors": [{"first": "Benjamin", "middle": ["I"], "last": "Rubinstein", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Author(s): Rubinstein, Benjamin | Advisor(s): Bartlett, Peter L | Abstract: Statistical Machine Learning is used in many real-world systems, such as web search, network and power management, online advertising, finance and health services, in which adversaries are incentivized to attack the learner, motivating the urgent need for a better understanding of the security vulnerabilities of adaptive systems. Conversely, research in Computer Security stands to reap great benefits by leveraging learning for building adaptive defenses and even designing intelligent attacks on existing systems. This dissertation contributes new results in the intersection of Machine Learning and Security, relating to both of these complementary research agendas.The first part of this dissertation considers Machine Learning under the lens of Computer Security, where the goal is to learn in the presence of an adversary. Two large case-studies on email spam filtering and network-wide anomaly detection explore adversaries that manipulate a learner by poisoning its training data. In the first study, the False Positive Rate (FPR) of an open-source spam filter is increased to 40% by feeding the filter a training set made up of 99% regular legitimate and spam messages, and 1% dictionary attack spam messages containing legitimate words. By increasing the FPR the adversary affects a Denial of Service attack on the filter. In the second case-study, the False Negative Rate of a popular network-wide anomaly detector based on Principal Components Analysis is increased 7-fold (increasing the attacker's chance of subsequent evasion by the same amount) by a variance injection attack of chaff traffic inserted into the network at training time. This high-variance chaff traffic increases the traffic volume by only 10%. In both cases the effects of increasing the information or the control available to the adversary are explored; and effective counter-measures are thoroughly evaluated, including a method based on Robust Statistics for the network anomaly detection domain.The second class of attack explored on learning systems, involves an adversary aiming to evade detection by a previously-trained classifier. In the evasion problem the attacker searches for a negative instance of almost-minimal distance to some target positive, by submitting a small number of queries to the classifier. Efficient query algorithms are developed for almost-minimizing Lp cost over any classifier partitioning feature space into two classes, one of which is convex. For the case of a convex positive class and p \u2264 1, algorithms with linear query complexity are provided, along with lower bounds that almost match; when pg1 a threshold phenomenon occurs whereby exponential query complexity is necessary for good approximations. For the case of a convex negative class and p \u2265 1, a randomized Ellipsoid-based algorithm finds almost-minimizers with polynomial query complexity. These results show that learning the decision boundary is sufficient, but not necessary for evasion, and can require much greater query complexity.The third class of attack aims to violate the confidentiality of the learner's training data given access to a learned hypothesis. Mechanisms for releasing Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers are developed. Algorithmic stability of the SVM is used to prove that the mechanisms preserve differential privacy, meaning that for an attacker with knowledge of all but one training example and the learning map, very little can be determined about the final unknown example using access to the trained classifier. Bounds on utility are established for the mechanisms: the privacy-preserving classifiers' predictions should approximate the SVM's predictions with high probability. In the case of learning with translation-invariant kernels corresponding to infinite-dimensional feature spaces (such as the RBF kernel), a recent result from large-scale learning is used to enable a finite encoding of the SVM while maintaining utility and privacy. Finally lower bounds on achievable differential privacy are derived for any mechanism that well-approximates the SVM.The second part of this dissertation considers Security under the lens of Machine Learning. The first application of Machine Learning is to a learning-based reactive defense. The CISO risk management problem is modeled as a repeated game in which the defender must allocate security budget to the edges of a graph in order to minimize the additive profit or return on attack (ROA) enjoyed by an attacker. By reducing to results from Online Learning, it is shown that the profit/ROA from attacking the reactive strategy approaches that of attacking the best fixed proactive strategy over time. This result contradicts the conventional dogma that reactive security is usually inferior to proactive risk management. Moreover in many cases, it is shown that the reactive defender greatly outperforms proactive approaches.The second application of Machine Learning to Security is for the construction of an attack on open-source software systems. When an open-source project releases a new version of their system, they disclose vulnerabilities in previous versions, sometimes with pointers to the patches that fixed them. Using features of diffs in the project's open-source repository, labeled by such disclosures, an attacker can train a model for discriminating between security patches and non-security patches. As new patches land in the open-source repository, before being disclosed as security or not, and before being released to users, the attacker can use the trained model to rank the patches according to likelihood of being a security fix. The adversary can then examine the ordered patches one-by-one until finding a security patch. For an 8 month period of Firefox 3's development history it is shown that an SVM-assisted attacker need only examine one or two patches per day (as selected by the SVM) in order to increase the aggregate window of vulnerability by 5 months.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "190013992", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3995652"}

In this paper, an ensemble-based outlier detection method is presented, where the members of the ensemble are convolutional neural networks (CNNs) combined with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Ensemble-based methods are highly popular approaches that increase the accuracy of a decision by aggregating the opinions of individual voters. From hybrid models constructed by the neural networks and the SVM classifier, we have created an ensemble system that makes decision based on the conception of majority voting and results in very accurate outlier filtering. It actually serves as a pre-filter that can be integrated into a more exhaustive image analysis process with rejecting images that fall outside the domain or have poor quality. We have tested the performance of the proposed method for filtering databases consisting of retinal and skin lesion images, respectively.

In many cases, H/LC classes follow pre\u2010defined hierarchical classification schemes (e.g., CORINE), in which fine H/LC categories are thematically nested within more general categories. However, none of the existing machine-learning algorithms account for this pre-defined hierarchical structure. Here we introduce a novel Random Forest (RF) based application of hierarchical classification, which fits a separate local classification model in every branching point of the thematic tree, and then integrates all the different local models to a single global prediction. We applied the hierarchal RF approach in a NATURA 2000 site in Italy, using two land-cover (CORINE, FAO-LCCS) and one habitat classification scheme (EUNIS) that differ from one another in the shape of the class hierarchy. For all 3 classification schemes, both the hierarchical model and a flat model alternative provided accurate predictions, with kappa values mostly above 0.9 (despite using only 2.2\u20133.2% of the study area as training cells). The flat approach slightly outperformed the hierarchical models when the hierarchy was relatively simple, while the hierarchical model worked better under more complex thematic hierarchies. Most misclassifications came from habitat pairs that are thematically distant yet spectrally similar. In 2 out of 3 classification schemes, the additional constraints of the hierarchical model resulted with fewer such serious misclassifications relative to the flat model. The hierarchical model also provided valuable information on variable importance which can shed light into \u201cblack-box\u201d based machine learning algorithms like RF. We suggest various ways by which hierarchical classification models can increase the accuracy and interpretability of H/LC classification maps.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2017.12.002", "venue": null, "journal": "Isprs Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing", "mag_id": "2788936431", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125353730"}

For this purpose, we applied remote sensing and statistical-based machine learning algorithms for experimental dust storm studies in the Khorasan Razavi Province, in north-eastern Iran. We identified dust sources in the study area using MODIS satellite images during the 2005\u20132016 period. For dust source identification, four indices encompassing BTD3132, BTD2931, NDDI, and D variable for 23 MODIS satellite images were calculated. As a result, 65 dust source points were identified, which were categorized into dust source data points for training and validation of the machine learning algorithms. Three statistical-based machine learning algorithms were used including Weights of Evidence (WOE), Frequency Ratio (FR), and Random Forest (RF) to produce DSSM for the study region. We used land use, lithology, slope, soil, geomorphology, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and distance from river as conditioning variables in the modelling. To check the performance of the models, we applied the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC). As for the AUC success rate (training), the FR and WOE algorithms resulted in 82 and 83% accuracy, respectively, while the RF algorithm resulted in 91% accuracy. As for the AUC predictive rate (validation), the accuracy of all three models, FR, WOE, and RF, were 80, 81, and 88%, respectively. Although all three algorithms produced acceptable susceptibility maps of dust sources, the results indicated better performance of the RF algorithm.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ecoinf.2020.101059", "venue": "Ecol.

A key issue in this approach is an efficient screening system to identify haploid kernels from the hybrid kernels crossed with the inducer. At present, haploid kernel selection is carried out manually using the\"red-crown\" kernel trait (the haploid kernel has a non-pigmented embryo and pigmented endosperm) controlled by the R1-nj gene. Manual selection is time-consuming and unreliable. Furthermore, the color of the kernel embryo is concealed by the pericarp. Here, we establish a novel approach for identifying maize haploid kernels based on visible (Vis) spectroscopy and support vector machine (SVM) pattern recognition technology. The diffuse transmittance spectra of individual kernels (141 haploid kernels and 141 hybrid kernels from 9 genotypes) were collected using a portable UV-Vis spectrometer and integrating sphere. The raw spectral data were preprocessed using smoothing and vector normalization methods. The desired feature wavelengths were selected based on the results of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The wavelengths with p values above 0. 05 were eliminated because the distributions of absorbance data in these wavelengths show no significant difference between haploid and hybrid kernels. Principal component analysis was then performed to reduce the number of variables. The SVM model was evaluated by 9-fold cross-validation. In each round, samples of one genotype were used as the testing set, while those of other genotypes were used as the training set. The mean rate of correct discrimination was 92.06%. This result demonstrates the feasibility of using Vis spectroscopy to identify haploid maize kernels. The method would help develop a rapid and accurate automated screening-system for haploid kernels.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "26978947", "doi": null, "venue": "Guang pu xue yu guang pu fen xi = Guang pu", "journal": "Guang pu xue yu guang pu fen xi = Guang pu", "mag_id": "2411584863", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["208522888"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:45449388"}

BMKG is one of the national agency in Indonesia that doing research in the field of meteorology, climatology, and geophysics in Indonesia using several methods in predicting rainfall. However, the accuracy of predicted results from BMKG methods is still less than optimal, causing the accuracy of the planting calendar to only reach 50% for the entire territory of Indonesia. The reason is because of the dynamics of atmospheric patterns (such as sea-level temperatures and tropical cyclones) in Indonesia are uncertain and there are weaknesses in each method used by BMKG. Another popular method used for rainfall prediction is the Deep Learning (DL) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) included in the Neural Network (NN). ELM has a simpler structure, and non-linear approach capability and better convergence speed from Back Propagation (BP). Unfortunately, Deep Learning method is very complex, if not using the process of simplification, and can be said more complex than the BP. In this study, the prediction system was made using ELM-based Simplified Deep Learning to determine the exact regression equation model according to the number of layers in the hidden node.

Hence, the potential of multi-date RapidEye data for classifying numerous agricultural classes was investigated in this study. In an agricultural area in Northern Israel two complete crop cycles 2013 and 2014 with two cultivation periods each were investigated.

This method is improved by changing the classification error into the Cohen kappa value, by adding an extra factor to avoid correlated features and by adapting the OOB sample selection to obtain a patient independent validation.

However, such methods are generally not completely lazy because the neighborhood size k (or other locality parameter) is usually chosen by cross validation on the training set, which can require significant preprocessing and risks overfitting. We propose a simple alternative to cross validation of the neighborhood size that requires no preprocessing: instead of committing to one neighborhood size, average the discriminants for multiple neighborhoods. We show that this forms an expected estimated posterior that minimizes the expected Bregman loss with respect to the uncertainty about the neighborhood choice. We analyze this approach for six standard and state-of-the-art local classifiers, including discriminative adaptive metric kNN (DANN), a local support vector machine (SVM-KNN), hyperplane distance nearest neighbor (HKNN), and a new local Bayesian quadratic discriminant analysis (local BDA). The empirical effectiveness of this technique versus cross validation is confirmed with experiments on seven benchmark data sets, showing that similar classification performance can be attained without any training.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TKDE.2009.159", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2146396044", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["274094", "6321120", "16371053", "7602997", "6156023", "379473", "1857015", "17294449", "15570588", "1254", "5874434", "1405220", "11394432", "8537968", "54516176", "916516", "12516574", "8021462", "61818735", "2630155", "17119931", "121897067", "18029871", "121589596", "12827035", "38003593", "2198160", "38903640", "116824954", "16176369", "961425"], "inbound_citations": ["16210885", "26883162", "15914400", "14482285", "4862536", "11815248", "15882228", "7509714", "11199417", "53465832", "17934305", "838641", "10377539", "546189", "15050017", "49667056", "10261937", "2202495", "46231092", "42861314", "6544582", "55378484", "18853417", "125732728", "15869912", "1463420", "18354384", "14974766", "52831428", "210976552"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:791608"}

In real world application data drawn from non-stationary distribution, arise the problem of \"concept drift\" or \"non-stationary learning\". Drifting of dataset is often associated with online learning scenario. There are several approaches to track the drift from the dataset; detection of drift has got major research attention. One of the problems of filtering is that it cannot detect concepts change or drift happens as time goes accurately. To deal with the concept drift this paper shows some results of different kind of approach for various kinds of datasets. Detection of drift works for two different levels; warning, and alarm level.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2183354860", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61864661"}

Like many other neurological disorders, epilepsy can be assessed by the electroencephalogram (EEG). The EEG signal is highly non-linear and non-stationary, and hence, it is difficult to characterize and interpret it. However, it is a well-established clinical technique with low associated costs. In this work, we propose a methodology for the automatic detection of normal , pre-ictal , and ictal conditions from recorded EEG signals. Four entropy features namely Approximate Entropy ( ApEn ), Sample Entropy ( SampEn ), Phase Entropy 1 ( S1 ), and Phase Entropy 2 ( S2 ) were extracted from the collected EEG signals. These features were fed to seven different classifiers: Fuzzy Sugeno Classifier (FSC), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), Decision Tree (DT), Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC). Our results show that the Fuzzy classifier was able to differentiate the three classes with a high accuracy of 98.1%.

Continuous stress can lead to various mental and physical problems and especially for the people who always face emergency situations (e.g., fireman): it may alter their actions and put them in danger. Therefore, it is meaningful to provide the assessment of the stress of an individual. Based on this idea, the Psypocket project is proposed which is aimed at making a portable system able to analyze accurately the stress state of an individual based on his physiological, psychological and behavioural modifications. It should then offer solutions for feedback to regulate this state.The research of this thesis is an essential part of the Psypocket project. In this thesis, we discuss the feasibility and the interest of stress recognition from heterogeneous data. Not only physiological signals, such as Electrocardiography (ECG), Electromyography (EMG) and Electrodermal activity (EDA), but also reaction time (RT) are adopted to recognize different stress states of an individual. For the stress recognition, we propose an approach based on a SVM classifier (Support Vector Machine). The results obtained show that the reaction time can be used to estimate the level of stress of an individual in addition or not to the physiological signals. Besides, we discuss the feasibility of an embedded system which would realize the complete data processing.

Our understanding of the mechanics underlying important processes in fluvial geomorphology, hydrodynamics, and aquatic ecology inevitably requires knowledge about the grain size distribution of river bed material. Standard methods of sampling bed surface material may introduce errors due to biases and inadequate sample size. Alternative areal or volumetric sampling procedures are often impractical, particularly in coarse channel beds. Furthermore, all invasive sampling techniques can compromise laboratory flume experiments. These concerns suggest that there is a practical need for a reliable, automated, non-invasive procedure for obtaining the grain size distribution of bed surface material. Although considerable effort has been made to automatically generate grain size distributions using image processing and analysis techniques, the problem remains quite challenging: issues such as varying lighting conditions, partial immersion of particles in water, and heterogeneous mineralogy result in ambiguities that cannot be easily resolved. Feature extraction introduces further biases due to overor under-segmentation of the image. Moreover, unless the grain distributions are fairly homogeneous between different locations, and images are collected in similar fashion, it is difficult to parameterize any such method in a transferable manner. In this study we present an image processing and machine learning procedure to automatically identify and measure grains from photographic images of gravel-bedded rivers. We apply the state-of-the-art of image segmentation techniques, making use of local cues such as brightness, color, and texture in a multiscale approach. These cues are globalized using a graph partitioning method on the oriented contour signal. The resulting boundary probability signal is treated by a region-merging procedure that avoids the artifacts of standard segmentation, providing a flexible hierarchical structure which allows us to progressively retain the grains which give us the greatest level of confidence, based on a learned decisional model. Our parameter-free procedure characterizes grain size distributions both quantitatively and spatially, enabling the tool to deliver a spatial grid of grain size distributions at multiple scales, the finest of which depends upon image resolution and sediment characteristics. We test the procedure on a unique dataset composed of a high-resolution photographic survey of the bed surface of a near-field-scale flume in which diverse square patches of particles were removed and sieved to obtain precise measurements. The results show that this procedure effectively and automatically recovers particle size distributions and the spatial pattern of sorting processes acting on the bed.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1635624689", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:128517505"}

This paper describes a multi-label recognizer that combines a Fuzzy approach with a Random Forest classifier to recognize both polarity and discrete emotions elicited by an image, using its valence and arousal ratings. Polarity indicates whether the emotional content of the image is negative, neutral, or positive, whereas emotions provide a more detailed description of the emotional content conveyed by the image. We evaluated our multi-label recognizer using pictures from four existing datasets containing images annotated with emotional content and valence and arousal ratings. Experimental results show that our recognizer is able to identify polarity with a precision of 84.8%, single emotions with 80.7%, and two emotions with 81.1%.

Similar connectionist models of language acquisition have arbitrary devices and architectures which make them mimic the effect of rules.

Forecasting stochastic processes such as epidemics is challenging since there are several biological, behavioral, and environmental factors that influence the number of cases observed at each point during an epidemic. However, accurate forecasts of epidemics would impact timely and effective implementation of public health interventions. In this study, we introduce a Dirichlet process (DP) model for classifying and forecasting influenza epidemic curves. The DP model is a nonparametric Bayesian approach that enables the matching of current influenza activity to simulated and historical patterns, identifies epidemic curves different from those observed in the past and enables prediction of the expected epidemic peak time. The method was validated using simulated influenza epidemics from an individual-based model and the accuracy was compared to that of the tree-based classification technique, Random Forest (RF), which has been shown to achieve high accuracy in the early prediction of epidemic curves using a classification approach. We also applied the method to forecasting influenza outbreaks in the United States from 1997\u20132013 using influenza-like illness (ILI) data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We made the following observations. First, the DP model performed as well as RF in identifying several of the simulated epidemics. Second, the DP model correctly forecasted the peak time several days in advance for most of the simulated epidemics. Third, the accuracy of identifying epidemics different from those already observed improved with additional data, as expected. Fourth, both methods correctly classified epidemics with higher reproduction numbers (R) with a higher accuracy compared to epidemics with lower R values. Lastly, in the classification of seasonal influenza epidemics based on ILI data from the CDC, the methods\u2019 performance was comparable. Although RF requires less computational time compared to the DP model, the algorithm is fully supervised implying that epidemic curves different from those previously observed will always be misclassified. In contrast, the DP model can be unsupervised, semi-supervised or fully supervised. Since both methods have their relative merits, an approach that uses both RF and the DP model could be beneficial.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3901791", "pubmed_id": "24405642", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2334-14-12", "venue": "BMC Infectious Diseases", "journal": "BMC Infectious Diseases", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2021934927", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["22974230", "62173939", "17120915", "6667963", "9036251", "7904616", "11571456", "9777424", "2258974", "6009000", "17418322", "11879697", "17933266", "154218811", "30424593", "8086352", "158408595", "123196399", "16371659", "25064883", "338889"], "inbound_citations": ["15050490", "215219407", "12102599", "215458269", "58543108", "48362328", "215216667", "338889", "2376992"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:338889"}

Our research proposes a technique for identifying influencers on Twitter social media platform using extracted features from six months of collected tweets from November 2016 to March 2017. The proposed method contains two types of feature which are static and dynamic features. The static features include the weekday, the time period of the first retweet, and its author\u2019s numbers of interaction and relation consist of retweets of the hashtag, followers, followings, friends, favorites, and statuses. The dynamic features are the changes in the author\u2019s numbers of interaction and relation since the first retweet to a target time. The features were extracted according to a period of time according to Bursting State and bursting duration of 30, 60, and 120 minutes.

The classical machine learning methods need hand-crafted features to perform classification. CNN's, on the other hand, performs classification by extracting image features directly from raw images. The features extracted by CNN strongly depends on the training data set size. If the size is small, CNN tends to overfit. So, deep CNN's(DCNN) with transfer learning has evolved. The prime aim of the present paper is to explore the capability of a pre-trained DCNN VGG-16 model with transfer learning for pathological brain image categorization. Only, the last few layers of the VGG-16 model were replaced to accommodate new image categories in the present application. The pre-trained model with transfer learning has been validated on the dataset taken from the Harvard Medical School repository, comprising of normal as well as abnormal MR images with different neurological diseases. The data set was then partitioned using a 10-fold cross-validation mechanism. The validation on the test set using sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), and, accuracy (Acc), reveal that the pre-trained VGG-16 model with transfer learning exhibited the best performance in contrast to the other existing state-of-the-art works.

Most GWA studies use single SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) approaches that mainly focused on assessing the association between each individual SNP and disease; therefore they cannot take into account the combinations of SNPs. However, complex diseases are thought to involve complex etiologies including complicated interactions between many SNPs. Thus, different approaches are necessary to identify SNPs that influence disease risk jointly or in complex interactions. To discover SNP-SNP interactions, in this paper we propose first to use an improvement of Random Forest algorithm tailored for structured GWAS data, all rules are then extracted from the trees to analyse SNPs interactions. Our method allows one to select subgroups of informative SNPs which are most relevant to disease for building accurate decision trees and then we enable educe SNPs interactions from these trees.

We use quantitative seismic interpretations for detection of shallow biogenic gas accumulations in the Qaidam Basin, China, employing an integrated workflow that incorporates petrophysical data, seismic attribute analysis, Constrained Simultaneous Inversion (C-SI) and Bayesian-based Support Vector Machine (B-SVM) inference. Previous petrophysical studies have shown that it is challenging to effectively identify gas-bearing intervals using parameters such as impedance, Poisson\u2019s ratio and porosity, because the reservoir sediments are unconsolidated and at shallow depths. The resistivity well-log response remains as an effective tool for estimating gas saturation and identifying gas-bearing intervals. In this study, we propose the use of the petroleum pore-volume, which is defined as the product of reservoir porosity and gas saturation, to detect biogenic gas accumulations seismically. Rock properties inferred from seismic inversion, such as compressional velocity (Vp), shear velocity (Vs) and density, cannot be used directly for petroleum pore-volume estimation. Therefore, we employ a Bayesian-based support vector machine approach to cross-link well-log properties, seismic AVO attributes and seismic rock properties to quantitatively predict petroleum pore-volume in 2D and 3D seismic dataset. Because seismic information is crucial to statistical inference, we propose C-SI to infer the Vp, Vs and density from seismic elastic impedance gathers, which can be generated from seismic gathers using a traditional recursive seismic inversion method. The C-SI procedures use the Interior-Point algorithm to optimize and solve elastic impedance equations. The Interior-Point method is a popular method for handling constrained non-convex, non-linear optimization problems that involve simultaneously inverting the seismic properties with thousands of seismic samples. This case study indicates that the integrated study workflow is useful for quantitatively predicting petroleum pore-volume, especially in the depth-domain, and that it is an excellent potential indicator for biogenic gas accumulations in complicated geological settings.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2113/gscpgbull.63.1.108", "venue": null, "journal": "Bulletin of Canadian Petroleum Geology", "mag_id": "2163870893", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:131089602"}

The availability of high-resolution satellite images provides easy and cost-effective mapping of land features that was not possible using medium or low resolution imagery. Since supervised classification methods give better results for accuracy and performance, supervised classification methods are preferred. By increasing separability of several land-use types, it is possible to group a satellite image into subparts which lead to solution to land cover mapping problem with application of supervised classification methods. Supervised classification methods use prior examples as a training to classify other unseen samples. In this study, a 'traditional' supervised classification method called Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are compared. No single classifier is proven yet to satisfactorily classify all the basic land cover classes that mean there is no best classifier yet for both performance and accuracy. However, individual evaluations together with pros and cons of each method could give insight about applications of the methods compatible with the intent. MLC is statistical parametric method based on probability calculations, but small dataset size causes some problems.

Consequently, predicting the future status of a roadway is valuable for travelers in making better travel decisions. The deployment of stationary sensors and the proliferation of mobile vehicle probes provide researchers with a wealth of historical and real-time data that can be used for the automatic prediction of congestion along freeway segments. In this paper we introduce a new algorithm for the automatic prediction of congestion using Adaptive Boosting machine learning classifiers. The proposed algorithm creates the learning dataset by identifying congested sections using a skewed distribution mixture model of speed data to create a binary congestion matrix. The elements of this binary matrix are then used as responses in the training of the classifiers. The predictors for the classifier during the training phase are windows (slots) of the historical spatiotemporal speed matrix. In the real-time running phase, the classifiers use the most recent spatiotemporal speed matrix window to predict the short- and medium-term (up to 100 minutes into the future) status of the roadway. Experimental results using archived data from a 22-mile section of the northbound Interstate 5 (I-5) corridor in the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan region demonstrates promising high true positive and low false positive rates.

Relevant studies often use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to explore structural differences and responsiveness within brain regions. However, as this technique is expensive and commonly induces claustrophobia, it is frequently refused by patients. Thus, this study used non-contact infrared thermal facial images (ITFIs) to analyze facial temperature changes evoked by different emotions in moderately and markedly ill schizophrenia patients. Schizophrenia is an emotion-related disorder, and images eliciting different types of emotions were selected from the international affective picture system (IAPS) and presented to subjects during ITFI collection. ITFIs were aligned using affine registration, and the changes induced by small irregular head movements were corrected. The average temperatures from the forehead, nose, mouth, left cheek, and right cheek were calculated, and continuous temperature changes were used as features. After performing dimensionality reduction and noise removal using the component analysis method, multivariate analysis of variance and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm were used to identify moderately and markedly ill schizophrenia patients. Analysis of five facial areas indicated significant temperature changes in the forehead and nose upon exposure to various emotional stimuli and in the right cheek upon evocation of high valence low arousal (HVLA) stimuli. The most significant P-value (lower than 0.001) was obtained in the forehead area upon evocation of disgust. Finally, when the features of forehead temperature changes in response to low valence high arousal (LVHA) were reduced to 9 using dimensionality reduction and noise removal, the identification rate was as high as 94.3%.

One-shot generation refers to a task of taking an image which belongs to a class not used in the training phase and then generating a set of new images belonging to the same class. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which represents a type of deep neural networks with competing generator and discriminator, has proven to be useful in generating realistic images. Especially DAGAN, which maps the input image to a low-dimensional space via an encoder and then back to the example space via a decoder, has been quite effective with datasets such as handwritten character datasets. However, when the class corresponds to a fine-grained category, DAGAN occasionally generates images which are regarded as belonging to other classes due to the rich variety of the examples in the class and the low dissimilarities of the examples among the classes. For example, it accidentally generates facial images of different persons when the class corresponds to a specific person. To circumvent this problem, we introduce a metric learning with a triplet loss to the bottleneck layer of DAGAN to penalize such a generation. We also extend the optimization algorithm of DAGAN to an alternating procedure for two types of loss functions. Our proposed method outperforms DAGAN in the GAN-test task for VGG-Face dataset and CompCars dataset by 5.6% and 4.8% in accuracy, respectively.

However, in real-world data sources, attributes are more or less associated with each other in terms of certain coupling relationships. Accordingly, recent works on attribute dependency aggregation have introduced the co-occurrence of attribute values to explore attribute coupling, but they only present a local picture in analyzing categorical data similarity. This is inadequate for deep analysis, and the computational complexity grows exponentially when the data scale increases. This paper proposes an efficient data-driven similarity learning approach that generates a coupled attribute similarity measure for nominal objects with attribute couplings to capture a global picture of attribute similarity. It involves the frequency-based intra-coupled similarity within an attribute and the inter-coupled similarity upon value co-occurrences between attributes, as well as their integration on the object level. In particular, four measures are designed for the inter-coupled similarity to calculate the similarity between two categorical values by considering their relationships with other attributes in terms of power set, universal set, joint set, and intersection set. The theoretical analysis reveals the equivalent accuracy and superior efficiency of the measure based on the intersection set, particularly for large-scale data sets. Intensive experiments of data structure and clustering algorithms incorporating the coupled dissimilarity metric achieve a significant performance improvement on state-of-the-art measures and algorithms on 13 UCI data sets, which is confirmed by the statistical analysis. The experiment results show that the proposed coupled attribute similarity is generic, and can effectively and efficiently capture the intrinsic and global interactions within and between attributes for especially large-scale categorical data sets. In addition, two new coupled categorical clustering algorithms, i.e., CROCK and CLIMBO are proposed, and they both outperform the original ones in terms of clustering quality on UCI data sets and bibliographic data.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "25794382", "doi": "10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2325872", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1985032507", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2840573", "32940166", "17023207", "125866813", "28404065", "44684875", "10285335", "5584468", "15994243", "9790017", "207083657", "7463036", "1674836", "16809719", "22095084", "379178", "14824657", "207658890", "6276563", "613752", "10786183", "283796", "13254783", "121246739", "3264198", "5709930", "15567218", "16650021", "5954777", "116764021"], "inbound_citations": ["199488730", "14575646", "49349991", "52179849", "203605354", "7796356", "51975339", "39206749", "19248411", "52987448", "13659549", "56098214", "50782075", "31646335", "22979356", "54455150", "43956516", "4349863", "46928041", "201620493", "46961614", "61153541", "65138515"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10519440"}

However, in contrast to previous deep learning models for prediction and categorization, generative networks generally rely on instance normalization (IN) layer for better feature distribution, which performs significantly better than batch normalization(BN) in image style-transfer, image to image translation, etc. Unlike batch or group normalization that can be fused into convolutional layers and ignored during the network inference stage, an instance normalization layer induces intensive computation and memory access. However, prior deep learning accelerator designs for traditional Neural Network and Generative Adversarial Networks mostly focus on the acceleration of convolution and deconvolution layer but lack of support for IN operations, which could become a performance bottleneck on edge devices with insufficient computational power. To address this problem, we propose an inference accelerator for content generation (ACG-Engine) aimed to support the fundamental operations of generative networks, including convolution layers, deconvolution layers, specifically instance normalization layer. We performed a hardware-aware mathematical transformation of the IN operation for less computation complexity and memory-friendliness, so that it can be efficiently mapped to the classic 2D processing element array. Owing to the proposed optimization techniques, ACG-Engine achieves 4.56X speedup and improve power efficiency up to 29X compared to prior baseline acceleration scheme in generative network acceleration.

Patients labeled access/refractory are strongly influenced by presentation rate, semantic relatedness of distractors, and repetition, yet they seem relatively unaffected by lexical frequency. Degraded-store patients, on the other hand, are strongly affected by lexical frequency but are less affected by presentation rate, semantic relatedness, or repetition. Our account of these patterns of performance is based on the distinction between two different types of neurological damage: (1) damage to neuromodulatory systems that function to amplify neural signals while suppressing normal refractory-like effects and (2) damage to connections between groups of neurons that encode semantic information and are sensitive to frequency/familiarity. We present a connectionist model that learns to map spoken-word input to semantic representations and that incorporates a particular form of neural refractoriness referred to as synaptic depression, as well as a simple form of neuromodulation. We show that the model is capable of accounting for the contrasting patterns of semantic impairment under these two different forms of damage and, furthermore, demonstrate how it is capable of handling several documented cases that are exceptions to the basic patterns of impairment.

Next, the performance in terms of accuracy and the reliability of the system has been increased using DST by combining the probabilistic outputs of SVM and HMM classifiers.

Clinicians would be able to use this system without any changes to their techniques, while improving accuracy. We used data from CT scans of patients with metastatic carcinoma to predict prognosis. Specifically, we used the standard for evaluating response to treatment, RECIST, and new qualitative and quantitative features. An Evolutionary Programming trained Support Vector Machine (EP-SVM), was used to preprocess the data for two traditional survival analysis techniques: Cox Proportional Hazard Models and Kaplan Meier curves. This was compared to Logistic Regression (LR) and using cutoff points. Analyses were also done to compare different inputs and different radiologists.

They are an extension of classification and regression trees (CART). They perform well even in the presence of a large number of features and a small number of observations. In analogy to CART, random forests can deal with continuous outcome, categorical outcome, and time-to-event outcome with censoring. The tree-building process of random forests implicitly allows for interaction between features and high correlation between features. Approaches are available to measuring variable importance and reducing the number of features. Although random forests perform well in many applications, their theoretical properties are not fully understood. Recently, several articles have provided a better understanding of random forests, and we summarize these findings. We survey different versions of random forests, including random forests for classification, random forests for probability estimation, and random forests for estimating survival data. We discuss the consequences of (1) no selection, (2) random selection, and (3) a combination of deterministic and random selection of features for random forests. Finally, we review a backward elimination and a forward procedure, the determination of trees representing a forest, and the identification of important variables in a random forest. Finally, we provide a brief overview of different areas of application of random forests.

This paper describes and tests three of those conventional methods which include Generalized Linear Model, Softmax Regression Model, and Artificial Neural Network method and two improved Support Vector Regression (SVR) approaches based on swarm intelligence algorithm optimization, which include Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Firefly Algorithm. In order to improve the global searching ability of Firefly Algorithm, adaptive step factor and Levy flight are implemented simultaneously when updating the location function. Six factors are analysed, of which delay is identified as one significant factor in congested airports. Through a series of specific dynamic analyses, a case study of Beijing International Airport (PEK) is tested with historical data.

Most approaches have found it infeasible to determine the relevance of all possible queries to a given ad landing page and have focussed on making recommendations from a small set of phrases extracted (and expanded) from the page using NLP and ranking based techniques. In this paper, we eschew this paradigm, and demonstrate that it is possible to efficiently predict the relevant subset of queries from a large set of monetizable ones by posing the problem as a multi-label learning task with each query being represented by a separate label. We develop Multi-label Random Forests to tackle problems with millions of labels. Our proposed classifier has prediction costs that are logarithmic in the number of labels and can make predictions in a few milliseconds using 10 Gb of RAM. We demonstrate that it is possible to generate training data for our classifier automatically from click logs without any human annotation or intervention. We train our classifier on tens of millions of labels, features and training points in less than two days on a thousand node cluster. We develop a sparse semi-supervised multi-label learning formulation to deal with training set biases and noisy labels harvested automatically from the click logs. This formulation is used to infer a belief in the state of each label for each training ad and the random forest classifier is extended to train on these beliefs rather than the given labels.

Whilst traditional hand-guided feature engineering in many cases is simplified, the deep network architectures become increasingly more complex. A central question is whether we can distill the minimal set of structural priors that can provide us the maximal flexibility, and lead us to richer sets of structural primitives. Those structural priors will make the learning process more effective, and potentially lay the foundations towards the ultimate goal of building general intelligent systems. This dissertation focuses on how we can tackle different real world problems in computer vision and machine learning with carefully designed neural network architectures, guided by simple yet effective structural priors. In particular, this thesis focuses on two structural priors that have proven to be useful and generalizable in many different scenarios: the multi-scale prior, with an application in edge detection, and the sparse-connectivity prior implemented for generic visual recognition. Examples will be presented in the last part, on how to learn meaningful structures directly from data, rather than hard-wiring them by, for example, learning a convolutional pseudo-prior in the label space, or adopting a dynamic self-attention mechanism.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2891448299", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:69834162"}
