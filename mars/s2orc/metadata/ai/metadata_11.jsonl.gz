Its goal is a high level understanding of the data. For example, given an image as a collection of pixels, the goal is to identify the objects present in the image, such as people, trees, birds, to infer their actions (e.g., standing, flying) and interactions (e.g. a man is feeding a bird). Structure learning has multiple applications in a variety of domains, including the analysis of cellular processes in biology, computer vision, and natural language processing, to name only a few. In the recent couple of decades enormous progress has been made in data analysis methods that are not based on explicit structure, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) or other kernel-based methods. Nevertheless, the importance of learning explicit structures remains crucial. There are multiple benefits to structure-based learning as opposed to methods, where structure is present implicitly, e.g. in the form of a kernel. The primary reason is that it is easier for us as humans to manipulate objects like cars and people rather than raw pixels or kernel matrices. For example, a natural query for a human would be: \u201cfind the photos of me picking mushrooms last summer\u201d. Thus we need a learning algorithm to go all the way up from pixels to persons, mushrooms, trees, etc., and also actions like picking, standing, and so on. Another important reason to learn structure in data is \u201cto understand the world around us\u201d for example, to understand biological processes or even how our own brain works. It also becomes easier to control or influence different processes once we learn their structure and extract simple rules governing their dynamics.

Various methods for automatic coding of AUs have been proposed, however, their performance is still far below of that attained by expert human coders. Several attempts have been made to leverage these methods to reduce the burden of manual coding of AU activations (presence/absence). Nevertheless, this has not been exploited in the context of AU intensity coding, which is a far more difficult task. To this end, we propose an expertdriven probabilistic approach for joint modeling and estimation of AU intensities. Specifically, we introduce a Conditional Random Field model for joint estimation of the AU intensity that updates its predictions in an iterative fashion by relying on expert knowledge of human coders. We show in our experiments on two publicly available datasets of AU intensity (DISFA and FERA2015) that the AU coding process can significantly be facilitated by the proposed approach, allowing human coders to faster make decisions about target AU intensity.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CVPRW.2016.183", "venue": "2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)", "journal": "2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2474388930", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6600989", "142736456", "9395736", "7004602", "9731096", "117529409", "17771700", "5914579", "10635738", "277918", "23380284", "12414828", "16260193", "15811205", "4246027", "6361228", "195652429", "7566628", "15833529", "13168820", "6992992", "786895", "14779643", "10072655"], "inbound_citations": ["128362872", "52233687", "204939141", "86705958"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1531673"}

Unfortunately, the illumination condition is usually uncontrolled and unpredictable in most practical applications. Numerous methods have been developed to tackle this problem but the results is poor, especially for images with extreme lighting condition. Furthermore, most traditional illumination processing methods only demonstrate on grayscale images and require strict alignment of face images, resulting in limited applications in real world. In this paper, we proposed to reformulate the face image illumination processing problem as a style translation task with a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The key insight is to use the powerful mapping ability of GAN between two domains without knowing their true distributions. In this new sight, we developed a new multi-scale dual discriminate nets and employed multi-scale adversarial learning for visually realistic illumination processing. Advocating the use of the insights from traditional method, we also use reconstruction learning and add two new loss items of image quality assessment to enforce the preservation of all other illumination excluding details on the generated image.

First, the positive samples in each frame are highly spatially overlapped, and they fail to capture rich appearance variations. Second, there exists extreme class imbalance between positive and negative samples. This paper presents the VITAL algorithm to address these two problems via adversarial learning. To augment positive samples, we use a generative network to randomly generate masks, which are applied to adaptively dropout input features to capture a variety of appearance changes. With the use of adversarial learning, our network identifies the mask that maintains the most robust features of the target objects over a long temporal span. In addition, to handle the issue of class imbalance, we propose a high-order cost sensitive loss to decrease the effect of easy negative samples to facilitate training the classification network.

This paper focuses on an innovative method of daily air pollution prediction using combination of Support Vector Machine (SVM) as predictor and Partial Least Square (PLS) as a data selection tool based on the measured values of CO concentrations. ::: ::: The CO concentrations of Rey monitoring station in the south of Tehran, from Jan. 2007 to Feb. 2011, have been used to test the effectiveness of this method. The hourly CO concentrations have been predicted using the SVM and the hybrid PLS\u2013SVM models. Similarly, daily CO concentrations have been predicted based on the aforementioned four years measured data. Results demonstrated that both models have good prediction ability; however the hybrid PLS\u2013SVM has better accuracy. In the analysis presented in this paper, statistic estimators including relative mean errors, root mean squared errors and the mean absolute relative error have been employed to compare performances of the models. It has been concluded that the errors decrease after size reduction and coefficients of determination increase from 56 to 81% for SVM model to 65\u201385% for hybrid PLS\u2013SVM model respectively.

At planning stage, firstly it parameterizes the patient's respiratory deformation from the patient's treatment-planning Respiratory-Correlated CTs (RCCTs) by doing PCA analysis on the inter-phase respiratory deformations. Secondly, it simulates a set of training projection images from a set of deformed CTs where their associated deformation parameters are sampled within 3 standard deviations of the parameter's values observed in the RCCTs. Finally, it learns a Riemannian distance metric on projection intensity for each deformation parameter. The learned distance metric forms a Gaussian kernel of a kernel regression that minimizes the leave-one-out regression residual of the corresponding deformation parameter. At treatment stage, PML-SKR interpolates the patient's 3D deformation parameters from the parameter's values in the training cases using the kernel regression with the learned distance metrics. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: We tested PML-SKR on the NST (Nanotube Stationary Tomosynthesis) x-ray imaging system. In each test case, a DRR (dimension: 64\u00d764) of an x-ray source in the NST was simulated from a target CT for registration. The target CTs were deformed by normally distributed random samples of the first three deformation parameters. We generated 300 synthetic test cases from 3 lung datasets and measured the registration quality by the mTRE (mean Target Registration Error) over all cases and all voxels at tumor sites. With PML-SKR's registrations, the average mTRE and its standard deviation are down from 10.89\u00b14.44 to 0.67\u00b10.46 mm using 125 training projection images. The computation time for each registration is 12.71\u00b10.70 ms. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: The synthetic results have shown PML-SKR's promise in supporting real-time, accurate, and low-dose lung IGRT.

The reason for this is that the predictors are not reliable for the negative examples from non-binding sites in the promoter region.

In this study, we used different types of negative examples during training the classifier. These negative examples can be far away from the promoter regions or produced by randomisation or from the intronic region of genes. By using these negative examples during training, we observed their effect in improving predictions of TFBSs in the yeast. We also used a modified cross-validation method for this type of problem. Thus we observed substantial improvement in the classifier performance that could constitute a model for predicting TFBSs. Therefore, the major contribution of the analysis is that for the yeast genome, the position of binding sites could be predicted with high confidence using our technique and the predictions are of much higher quality than the predictions of the original prediction algorithms.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-32909-8_24", "venue": "EANN", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "27247422", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10113842"}

High activity of proteins reduces the cost of biocatalysts. A model that can predict protein activity from amino acid sequence is highly desired, as it aids experimental improvement of proteins. However, only limited data for protein activity are currently available, which prevents the development of such models. Since protein activity and solubility are correlated for some proteins, the publicly available solubility dataset may be adopted to develop models that can predict protein solubility from sequence. The models could serve as a tool to indirectly predict protein activity from sequence. In literature, predicting protein solubility from sequence has been intensively explored, but the predicted solubility represented in binary values from all the developed models was not suitable for guiding experimental designs to improve protein solubility. Here we propose new machine learning models for improving protein solubility in vivo. We first implemented a novel approach that predicted protein solubility in continuous numerical values instead of binary ones. After combing it with various machine learning algorithms, we achieved a prediction accuracy of 76.28 percent when Support Vector Machine algorithm was used. Continuous values of solubility are more meaningful in protein engineering, as they enable researchers to choose proteins with higher predicted solubility for experimental validation, while binary values fail to distinguish proteins with the same value.

Two blending approaches that use the four models as predictors have been studied: the horizon approach constructs a different blending model for each forecast horizon, while the general approach trains a single model valid for all horizons. The influence on the blending models of adding information about weather types is also studied. The approaches have been evaluated in the same four Iberian Peninsula stations of Part 1. Blending approaches have been extended to a regional context with the goal of obtaining improved regional forecasts. In general, results show that blending greatly outperforms the individual predictors, with no large differences between the blending approaches themselves. Horizon approaches were more suitable to minimize rRMSE and general approaches work better for rMAE. The relative improvement in rRMSE obtained by model blending was up to 17% for GHI (16% for DNI), and up to 15% for rMAE. Similar improvements were observed for the regional forecast. An analysis of performance depending on the horizon shows that while the advantage of blending for GHI remains more or less constant along horizons, it tends to increase with horizon for DNI, with the largest improvements occurring at 6 h. The knowledge of weather conditions helped to slightly improve further the forecasts (up to 3%), but only at some locations and for rRMSE.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.solener.2019.11.091", "venue": null, "journal": "Solar Energy", "mag_id": "2995623352", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213019001"}

The main challenge of adapting GCNs on large-scale graphs is the scalability issue that it incurs heavy cost both in computation and memory due to the uncontrollable neighborhood expansion across layers. In this paper, we accelerate the training of GCNs through developing an adaptive layer-wise sampling method. By constructing the network layer by layer in a top-down passway, we sample the lower layer conditioned on the top one, where the sampled neighborhoods are shared by different parent nodes and the over expansion is avoided owing to the fixed-size sampling. More importantly, the proposed sampler is adaptive and applicable for explicit variance reduction, which in turn enhances the training of our method. Furthermore, we propose a novel and economical approach to promote the message passing over distant nodes by applying skip connections.

Devanagari script is widely used script in Indian sub-continent; also Devanagari script forms the basis for many other scripts in Indian sub-continent.

On the other hand, the fields of Business Intelligence (BI)/Data Mining (DM), which aim at extracting high-level knowledge from raw data, offer interesting automated tools that can aid the education domain. The present work intends to approach student achievement in secondary education using BI/DM techniques. Recent real-world data (e.g. student grades, demographic, social and school related features) was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. The two core classes (i.e. Mathematics and Portuguese) were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Also, four DM models (i.e. Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines) and three input selections (e.g. with and without previous grades) were tested. The results show that a good predictive accuracy can be achieved, provided that the first and/or second school period grades are available. Although student achievement is highly influenced by past evaluations, an explanatory analysis has shown that there are also other relevant features (e.g. number of absences, parent\u2019s job and education, alcohol consumption).

To enable downstream unsupervised learning on those domains, in this work we propose to learn features without using any labelled data by training neural networks to predict data distances in a randomly projected space. Random mapping is a theoretical proven approach to obtain approximately preserved distances. To well predict these random distances, the representation learner is optimised to learn genuine class structures that are implicitly embedded in the randomly projected space.

We hypothesized that integration of post-radiation clonogenic survival data with gene expression data across breast cancer cell (BCC) lines would generate a radiation sensitivity signature (RSS) and identify patients with tumors refractive to conventional therapy. ::: ::: Experimental Design: Using clonogenic survival assays, we identified the surviving fraction (SF-2Gy) after radiation across a range of BCC lines. Intrinsic radiosensitivity was correlated to gene expression using Spearman9s correlation. Functional analysis was performed in vitro, and enriched biological concepts were identified. The RSS was generated using a Random Forest model and was refined, cross-validated, and independently validated in additional breast cancer datasets. ::: ::: Results: Clonogenic survival identifies a range of radiosensitivity in human BCC lines (SF-2Gy 77%-17%) with no significant correlation to the intrinsic BC subtypes. 147 genes were correlated with radiosensitivity. Functional analysis of RSS genes identifies previously unreported radioresistance-associated genes. RSS was trained, cross-validated, and further refined to 51 genes which were enriched for concepts involving cell-cycle arrest and DNA damage response. RSS was validated in an independent dataset and was the most significant factor in predicting local recurrence on multivariate analysis, outperfoming all clincally used clinicopathologic features. ::: ::: Conclusions: We derive a human BC-specific RSS with biologic relevance and validate this signature for prediction of locoregional recurrence. By identifying patients with tumors refractory to standard radiation this signature has the potential to allow for personalization of radiotherapy.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "25904749", "doi": "10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-2898", "venue": "Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research", "journal": "Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2110480159", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["15549055", "6840112", "11910722", "23800645", "14472345", "22279488", "7006544", "3037160", "9098874", "14301245", "17720396", "20178186", "30393099", "42119916", "20739549", "7953330", "8020745", "16766214", "171963", "9976047", "14628726", "4395852", "3691248", "14906671", "24214210", "31437313", "10075774"], "inbound_citations": ["44085638", "53212666", "201019479", "209676321", "214957931", "215026520", "1219807", "3501918", "210841579", "49655439", "214856106", "197412526", "78225512", "199602710", "203924210", "24097710", "214849209", "62829508", "2182485"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213041"}

Knowledge of PPIs is becoming increasingly more important, which has prompted the development of technologies that are capable of discovering large-scale PPIs. Although many high-throughput biological technologies have been proposed to detect PPIs, there are unavoidable shortcomings, including cost, time intensity, and inherently high false positive and false negative rates. For the sake of these reasons, in silico methods are attracting much attention due to their good performances in predicting PPIs. In this paper, we propose a novel computational method known as RVM-AB that combines the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) model and Average Blocks (AB) to predict PPIs from protein sequences. The main improvements are the results of representing protein sequences using the AB feature representation on a Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM), reducing the influence of noise using a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and using a Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) based classifier. We performed five-fold cross-validation experiments on yeast and Helicobacter pylori datasets, and achieved very high accuracies of 92.98% and 95.58% respectively, which is significantly better than previous works. In addition, we also obtained good prediction accuracies of 88.31%, 89.46%, 91.08%, 91.55%, and 94.81% on other five independent datasets C. elegans, M. musculus, H. sapiens, H. pylori, and E. coli for cross-species prediction. To further evaluate the proposed method, we compare it with the state-of-the-art support vector machine (SVM) classifier on the yeast dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our RVM-AB method is obviously better than the SVM-based method. The promising experimental results show the efficiency and simplicity of the proposed method, which can be an automatic decision support tool. To facilitate extensive studies for future proteomics research, we developed a freely available web server called RVMAB-PPI in Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) for predicting PPIs.

This promising paradigm of machine learning known as ordinal classification or ordinal regression focus on classification problems where there exist a natural order between the classes, thus requiring specific methods and evaluation metrics. In this paper we compare 11 ordinal and 15 nominal state-of-the-art classifiers using oocytes of three fish species (Merluccius merluccius, Trisopterus luscus and Reinhardtius hippoglossoides). The best results are achieved by SVMOD, an ordinal decomposition method of the labelling space based on the Support Vector Machine, varying strongly with the number of states for each specie (about 95 and 80 % of accuracy with three and six states respectively). The classifiers designed specially for ordinal classification are able to capture the underlying nature of the state ordering much better than common nominal classifiers. This is demonstrated by several metrics specially designed to measure misclassification errors associated to states far in the ranking scale.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11063-015-9476-8", "venue": "Neural Processing Letters", "journal": "Neural Processing Letters", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2214677734", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["195291752", "207738357", "89141", "12886175", "1206", "961425", "1295499", "23948662", "30738140", "10344554", "12269265", "1836349", "14723701", "1769625", "23716943", "13861754", "15037168", "89621944", "86204162", "83587108", "123582503", "2090732", "10416252", "85689284", "201856", "85072276", "14780428", "12206117", "1278565", "4002607"], "inbound_citations": ["52902641"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18514743"}

However, paradoxically, there was virtually no overlap between the two signatures and both signatures performed poorly when classifying samples from the other study. A key reason for such unstable and study-dependent signatures is that current methods identify \u201cpassengers\u201d rather than \u201cdrivers\u201d of the phenotypic differences. Rather than identifying genes correlated with the phenotypes of interest, one should look instead for their upstream regulators, causally associated with the observed expression patterns. Here, we show that computationally inferred transcriptional regulation maps can be effectively interrogated for the unbiased inference of Master Regulators that may induce or suppress specific gene signatures associated with poor prognosis. Methods: We used two datasets of 295 and 286 samples each (hereafter denoted as NKI and Wang datasets) in which the authors had previously determined a 70-gene and a 76-gene prognostic signatures, respectively ( S NKI & S Wang ) [1,2]. We performed the following analysis independently on each of these datasets: (a) First, dataset was processed by the ARACNe algorithm [3] to infer a genome-wide transcriptional interaction network from GEP, (b) then, the network was interrogated using the Fisher Exact Test (FET) and Gene Sets Enrichment Analysis to identify a repertoire of candidate regulators, MR , whose targets were highly overlapping with the signature S , (c) finally, the MR genes were tested as classifiers of the good vs. poor outcome against the S signature, using 5-fold cross-validation based on a Support Vector Machine classifier. Results: From an unbiased list of 852 Transcription Factors (TF) shared by the two datasets, the analysis produced a list of highly overlapping Master Regulator candidates, with a 30% overlap among the top 20 inferred master regulator TFs ( p = 2\u00d710 -6 , FET), which is especially significant when compared to the 1 gene overlap between the two signatures, S NKI and S Wang ( p = 0.25, FET). To study the stability of MR genes as a function of training set, we repeated this procedure in the NKI dataset, using different GEP subsets to infer prognostic signatures. Results clearly show that while differential expression signatures were highly affected by the training sample choice, with only 8.6% average overlap between the top 70 genes, the inferred master regulator TFs were much more consistent, with a 47.8% overlap between the top 20 genes, despite the highly discordant signatures that were used to infer them. Classification result shows that even a single Master Regulator can predict progression to metastatic tumors with significant higher accuracy than the \u226570-gene signatures. Classification accuracy using the gene-signatures drops significantly (4% - 8%) when NKI signature is used to classify Wang samples or vice-versa, while Master Regulator predictions remained highly predictive. Conclusions: The inferred master regulators were much better conserved across training sets, consistently outperformed differentially expressed signatures in cross-validation studies, and were better able to classify samples in independent studies.

A key challenge in these systems is to determine when to intervene. While there are situations where the needs for intervention or feedback is clear (e.g., lane departure), it is often difficult to determine scenarios that deviate from normal driving conditions. These scenarios can appear due to errors by the drivers, presence of pedestrian or bicycles, or maneuvers from other vehicles. We formulate this problem as a driving anomaly detection, where the goal is to automatically identify cases that require intervention. Towards addressing this challenging but important goal, we propose a multimodal system that considers (1) physiological signals from the driver, and (2) vehicle information obtained from the controller area network (CAN) bus sensor. The system relies on conditional generative adversarial networks (GAN) where the models are constrained by the signals previously observed. The difference of the scores in the discriminator between the predicted and actual signals is used as a metric for detecting driving anomalies.

To tackle this challenge, we look at transfer learning approaches as a viable alternative. Given the large amount of available conversational data, we investigate whether generative conversational models can be leveraged to transfer affective knowledge for the target task of detecting emotions in context. We propose an approach where we first train a neural dialogue model and then perform parameter transfer to initiate our target model.

Due to this, building dynamic avatars from a single unconstrained input image is becoming a popular application. While previous techniques that attempt this require multiple input images or rely on transferring dynamic facial appearance from a source actor, we are able to do so using only one 2D input image without any form of transfer from a source image. We achieve this using a new conditional Generative Adversarial Network design that allows fine-scale manipulation of any facial input image into a new expression while preserving its identity. Our photoreal avatar GAN (paGAN) can also synthesize the unseen mouth interior and control the eye-gaze direction of the output, as well as produce the final image from a novel viewpoint. The method is even capable of generating fully-controllable temporally stable video sequences, despite not using temporal information during training. After training, we can use our network to produce dynamic image-based avatars that are controllable on mobile devices in real time. To do this, we compute a fixed set of output images that correspond to key blendshapes, from which we extract textures in UV space.

One way to overcome this problem is to characterize the pixel being classified by parameters measuring the spatial organization of the pixels in its neighborhood. In this study, textural parameters of one-step and two-step encoded images were calculated in the form of a vector. These parameters were subject to the support vector machine classifier to decide which class image is belonging to. Results showed that the encoding method is a proper way to compress an image without losing textural information. It reduces the size of data and thereby reducing the computation time characteristics. Keywords: Satellite images, textural features, co-occurrence matrix, classification 1. INTRODUCTION With the advent of remote sensing observation, satellites regularly offer a large number of images, data and information inaccessible from the ground. The analysis and interpretation of the remote sensing images is an important field of researches and scientific studies such as deforestation monitoring, evolution of desertification, water resource development and construction and updating topographic maps [1]. The classification of land cover from remote sensing imageries can be based on pixels or objects [2]. In a research, pixel-based thematic mapping accuracies produced using four different classification algorithms including Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Decision Trees (DTs), Artificial Neural Network Classifier (ANNC), and Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) were compared. Results of this study showed that the accuracy of SVM-based classification generally outperformed the other three classification techniques [3]. In another research, high spatial resolution airborne imagery was used and performance of a pixel-based classification based on MLC was compared with an object-based classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN). Although the 1-NN object-based classification had a better performance than the pixel-based MLC classification by 17%, average classification accuracy of pixel-based classification was 10% higher than object-based classification for 48 vegetation classes listed in that paper [4]. In a recent study, broad agricultural land cover types were classified for two time periods (1995 and 2005) using Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery. It compared land cover maps produced using MLC and K-NN algorithms and it was found that the difference in overall accuracy between these classification approaches was not statistically significant [5]. Another study used supervised machine learning algorithms including DTs, Random Forests (RFs), and SVMs to classify agricultural landscapes [2]. It conducted a visual and statistical assessment of the classification outputs * Corresponding author, email: keyvan.asefpour@ut.ac.ir \u00a9 2014 Alma Mater Publishing House", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.29081/jesr.v20i1.83", "venue": "Journal of Engineering Studies and Research", "journal": "Journal of Engineering Studies and Research", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2581721382", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": ["42072227", "62527324", "53361605", "129739884", "128066453", "11920848", "73710497", "129584509", "84237108", "108532011", "206786900", "138993", "9317935"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:132431795"}

After an automatic feature point localization step, we cluster the face into several regions, chosen for their importance into the facial expression process, according to the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and anatomic considerations. Then, we match those regions to reference models representing the six prototypical expressions using Iterative Closest Points (ICP). ICP tends to compensate the imprecisions in the face clustering relative to landmarks localization. Resulting matching scores are concatenated into a descriptor for the probe model.

Microcalcifications are tiny deposits of calcium in the breast tissue which are potential indicators for early detection of breast cancer. The dense nature of the breast tissue and the poor contrast of the mammogram image prohibit the effectiveness in identifying microcalcifications. Hence, a new approach to discriminate the microcalcifications from the normal tissue is done using wavelet features and is compared with different feature vectors extracted using Gray Level Spatial Dependence Matrix (GLSDM) and Gabor filter based techniques. A total of 120 Region of Interests (ROIs) extracted from 55 mammogram images of mini-Mias database, including normal and microcalcification images are used in the current research. The network is trained with the above mentioned features and the results denote that ELM produces relatively better classification accuracy (94%) with a significant reduction in training time than the other artificial neural networks like Bayesnet classifier, Naivebayes classifier, and Support Vector Machine.

Data augmentation and multi-feature fusion have been demonstrated to appropriately improve the model generalization ability for various vision tasks. This paper integrates these methods into the network structure to design three multi-feature fusion network. The input of network training adopts the same data from the multi-input method to realize data augmentation, and the diversity of extracted image features is greatly improved by fusing different features. Then, the trained network of different dataset size is utilized to verify the network training adaptability of multi-feature fusion network.

To finding the region of interest there are two methods are applied on it these are: segmentation and noise removal by using neural segmentation and thresholding respectively. After the extraction of abnormal part or region of interest, feature extraction is done through using three features: GLCM, GLDM and geometrical feature on which feature selection is applied to get higher accuracy. After calculating the value of each and every feature the classification is done through using method ANN (Artificial neural network) in which 40 mammograms are used to evaluate the terms named as True Positive, True Negative, False Positive, and False Negative with the help of confusion matrix. By using these confusion matrices, the system can understand the stage of each case. Performance evaluation explains that how much effective and beneficial the new research is. Hence, ANN are used to evaluate the performance through defining Accurateness (precision), Sensitivity and Specificity and also compare the results with existing SVM classification technique.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Advance Research, Ideas and Innovations in Technology", "mag_id": "2600539744", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:196073318"}

Visual analysis of human motion is presently one of the active research areas in video surveillance system. Human motion analysis relates the detection, tracking and recognition of activities of the people, and more generally, the understanding of human behaviours, from image sequences involving humans. The road side traffic video surveillance aims at using several image processing methods to obtain better traffic and road safety, which in turn provides direct solution for to reducing death rate of accident victims. The distributed computing process has an efficient solution for this scalability issues in traffic video surveillance system. In this paper, a road traffic video surveillance system is proposed which can automatically identify road accidents from live video files. The system alerts neighbouring hospitals and highway rescue teams when accidents occur. This paper proposes a methodology to process the video file using map-reduce framework for better network service and better scalability solution in surveillance system. Then, the distributed video files are enhanced with Gaussian filtering. Efficient object classification and detection is carried out using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) with Support Vector Machine (SVM) for traffic monitoring using video files from surveillance camera. Foreground object segmentation is a vital task which is carried out by Markov Random field (MRF) with Bayesian estimation process. This proposed method efficiently track and classify the foreground objects with use of object classification and detection and this will improve traffic monitoring in traffic scenes.

In this paper, setting the survival percentage under repeated drought condition as the target and support vector regression as the nonlinear screen tool, 6 integrated indexes including plant height, proline content, malondialdehyde content, leaf age, area of the first leaf under the central leaf and ascorbic acid were highlighted from 24 morphological and physiological indexes in 15 paddy rice cultivars. The results showed that support vector regression model with the 6 integrated indexes had a more distinct improvement in fitting and prediction precision than the linear reference models. Considering the simplicity of indexes measurement, the support vector regression model with only 6 morphological indexes including shoot dry weight, area of the second leaf under the central leaf, root shoot ratio, leaf age, leaf fresh weight, and area of the first leaf under the central leaf was also feasible.

However, traditional LiDAR only records discrete echo signals and provides limited feature parameters of point clouds, while full-waveform LiDAR (FWL) records the backscattered echo in the form of a waveform, which provides more echo information. With the development of machine learning, support vector machine (SVM) is one of the commonly used classifiers to deal with high dimensional data via small amount of samples. Ensemble learning, which combines a set of base classifiers to determine the output result, is presented and SVM ensemble is used to improve the discrimination ability, owing to small differences in features between different types of data. In addition, previous kernel functions of SVM usually cause under-fitting or over-fitting that decreases the generalization performance. Hence, a series of kernel functions based on wavelet analysis are used to construct different wavelet SVMs (WSVMs) that improve the heterogeneity of ensemble system. Meanwhile, the parameters of SVM have a significant influence on the classification result. Therefore, in this paper, FWL point clouds are classified by WSVM ensemble and particle swarm optimization is used to find the optimal parameters of WSVM.

In these methods, the classifier can use hints about the polarity of the words and the subject being discussed in order to infer the polarity of the text. However, many of these texts are short and, because of that, the classifier can have difficulties to infer these hints. We here propose a new sentiment analysis method that uses topic models to infer the polarity of short texts. The intuition of this approach is that, by using topics, the classifier is able to better understand the context and improve the performance in this task. In this approach, we first use methods to infer topics such as LDA, BTM and MedLDA in order to represent the review and, then, we apply a classifier (e.g. Linear SVM, Random Forest or Logistic Regression). In this method, we combine the results of classifiers and text representations in two ways: (1) by using single topic representation and multiple classifiers; (2) and using multiple topic representations and a single classifier. We also analyzed the impact of expanding these texts since the topic model methods can have difficulties to deal with the data sparsity present in these reviews. The proposed approach could achieve gains of up to 8.5% compared to our baseline.

To build the model, predictor variables and their values such as binding energy, IC50, torsional energy and surface area for both ligand and protein are extracted from the complex using AutoDock, AutoDock Vina and PyMOL. A total of 17 structures and 18 drugs were used for learning the support vector regression (SVR) model. Experimental results proved that the SVR-based affinity prediction model performs better than other regression models.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-981-10-8797-4_19", "venue": "Studies in Computational Intelligence", "journal": "Studies in Computational Intelligence", "mag_id": "2890766678", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:91651409"}

In this study, the groundwater level of the Kabodarahang aquifer located in Iran, Hamadan Province is simulated by means of three models: MODFLOW, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Wavelet-Extreme Learning Machine (WA-ELM). At the beginning, the groundwater level simulation is carried out by MODFLOW with reasonable accuracy so that the correlation coefficient (R2) and the scatter index (SI) are calculated 0.917 and 0.0004, respectively. After that, through different input combinations as well as the stepwise selection, 10 different models are developed as different lags for the ELM and WA-ELM models. Based on the numerical results yielded by all three models, WA-ELM is introduced as the superior model in simulating the groundwater level. For instance, the correlation coefficient (R2) and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSC) are computed 0.959 and 0.915, respectively. According to the uncertainty analysis, it is proved that the superior model has an underestimated performance. Furthermore, the by-products of the model such as weights and biases are then utilized to develop an explicit method for estimating the groundwater level. The developed model can be easily employed by an engineer with sufficient knowledge of matrix operation without prior information about the extreme learning machine.

The most commonly techniques used fraud detection methods are Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor algorithms (KNN).

The probabilistic sensitivity analysis is used to compute sensitivities of probabilistic constraints with respect to random variables. Since the probabilistic sensitivity analysis requires only the limit state function, and not the response surface or sensitivity of the response, an efficient classification method can be used for a sampling-based RBDO. The proposed virtual support vector machine (VSVM), which is a classification method, is a support vector machine (SVM) with virtual samples. By introducing virtual samples, VSVM overcomes the deficiency in existing SVM that uses only classification information as their input. In this paper, the universal Kriging method is used to obtain locations of virtual samples to improve the accuracy of the limit state function for highly nonlinear problems. A sequential sampling strategy effectively inserts new samples near the limit state function. In sampling-based RBDO, Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is used for the reliability analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Since SVM is an explicit classification method, unlike implicit methods, computational cost for evaluating a large number of MCS samples can be significantly reduced. Several efficiency strategies, such as the hyper-spherical local window for generation of the limit state function and the Transformations/Gibbs sampling method to generate uniform samples in the hyper-sphere, are also applied. Examples show that the proposed sampling-based RBDO using VSVM yields better efficiency in terms of the number of required samples and the computational cost for evaluating MCS samples while maintaining accuracy similar to that of sampling-based RBDO using the implicit dynamic Kriging (D-Kriging) method.\u00a9 2012 ASME", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1115/DETC2012-70715", "venue": "DAC 2012", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2313954171", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["116424295", "57497642"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61643236"}

However, feature representation for NVS is far behind the APS-based counterparts, resulting in lower performance in high-level computer vision tasks. To fully utilize the sparse and asynchronous nature, we propose a compact graph representation for NVS, which allows for end-to-end learning with graph convolution neural networks. We couple this with a novel end-to-end feature learning framework that accommodates both appearance-based and motion-based tasks. The core of framework comprises a spatial feature learning module, which utilizes our proposed residual-graph CNN (RG-CNN), for end-to-end learning of appearance-based features directly from graphs. We extend this with our proposed Graph2Grid block and temporal feature learning module for efficiently modelling temporal dependencies over multiple graphs and a long temporal extent. We show that performance of this framework generalizes to both object classification and action recognition, which, importantly, preserves the spatial and temporal coherence of spike events, while requiring less computation and memory. The experimental validation shows that our framework show that our proposed framework outperforms all recent methods on standard datasets.

By the time of their derivation, SFCscore functions were the best-performing scoring functions tested on large heterogeneous data sets, but the overall correlation was still not within the desired range. Similarly, despite the ever increasing amount of structure and affinity data, the general advancements in the development of empirical scoring functions have been rather moderate over the past years. However, more recently, Ballester and Mitchell [2] published a function that outperformed current state-of-the-art scoring functions when tested against the PDBbind benchmark set [3]. This function uses relatively simple atom contact counts as descriptors and is derived by the Random Forest algorithm. Here, we present a study in which we used Random Forests to derive a new function (\"SFCscoreRF\") based on the SFCscore descriptors as input data. Although this is not a fully non-parametric approach, the descriptors are supposed to capture more accurately the physically relevant interactions. We tested the new function against the PDBbind benchmark set and the CSAR-NRC HiQ 2010 set [4] and, in addition, performed the Leave-Cluster-Out validation as proposed by Kramer and Gedeck for the PDBbind set [5]. The results suggest that the new function significantly improves the predictive power of SFCscore, as it increases the correlation between predicted and experimentally determined affinities for the PDBbind benchmark set from r2 = 0.41 (best previous SFCscore function) to r2 = 0.61 (SFCscoreRF) and for the CSAR data set from r2 = 0.38 to r2 = 0.53.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3606197", "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1186/1758-2946-5-S1-P27", "venue": "Journal of Cheminformatics", "journal": "Journal of Cheminformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2102423909", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["8418783", "1833890", "8365381", "15298349", "45676737"], "inbound_citations": ["4473291"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:824696"}

The spatiotemporal dynamics of water fluxes and their relationship with land cover changes between 2009 and 2017 in the headwater Buzi sub-catchment in Zimbabwe is evaluated. To achieve this, land cover dynamics for the area under study were characterised from the 30 m Landsat data, using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm. After the land cover classification, the key water balance components namely; interception, transpiration and evapotranspiration (ET) contributions for each class in 2009 and 2017 were estimated. Image classification of Landsat data achieved good overall accuracies above 80% for the two periods. Results showed that the percentage of the plantation land cover types decreased slightly between 2009 (25.4%) and 2017 (22.5%). Partitioning the annual interception, transpiration and ET according to land cover classes showed that the highest amounts of ET in the basin were from plantation where land cover types with tea had the highest interception, transpiration and ET in the catchment. Higher ET, interception and transpiration were observed in the eastern parts of the catchment.

Mouse dynamics analysis techniques do not provide an acceptable level of accuracy, perhaps due to behavioral variability. This study presents a dimensionality-reduction-based approach to mitigate the behavioral variability of mouse dynamics and improve the performance of mouse-dynamics-based continuous authentication. Variability was measured over the schematic features and motor-skill features extracted from each mouse behavior data session. A unified framework of employing dimensionality reduction methods (Multidimensional Scaling, Laplacian Eigenmap, Isometric Feature Mapping, and Local Linear Embedding) was developed to reduce behavioral variability by obtaining predominant characteristics from the original feature space. Classification techniques (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Neural Network, and Nearest Neighbor) were applied to the transformed feature space to perform the authentication task. Analyses were conducted using data from 840 half-hour sessions of 28 participants. Results indicated that for sufficiently long sequences, the transformed feature spaces had much less variability and the corresponding authentication performance was better than the original feature space with improvements of the false-acceptance rate by 89.6% and of the false-rejection rate by 77.4% in some cases. Additionally, an investigation of the relationships between variability and authentication error rates and detection time indicated that the variability and authentication error rates reduce greatly with the increase of detection time.

Although transfer learning has been widely used to tackle the problem, the performance degrades on new data. In this paper, we present a novel approach (so-called IA-gen) to alleviate the issue of subject variations by regenerating expressions from any input facial images. First of all, we train conditional generative models to generate six prototypic facial expressions from any given query face image while keeping the identity related information unchanged. Generative Adversarial Networks are employed to train the conditional generative models, and each of them is designed to generate one of the prototypic facial expression images. Second, a regular CNN (FER-Net) is fine- tuned for expression classification. After the corresponding prototypic facial expressions are regenerated from each facial image, we output the last FC layer of FER-Net as features for both the input image and the generated images. Based on the minimum distance between the input image and the generated expression images in the feature space, the input image is classified as one of the prototypic expressions consequently. Our proposed method can not only alleviate the influence of inter-subject variations, but will also be flexible enough to integrate with any other FER CNNs for person-independent facial expression recognition.

The success of CNN-based HSI classification relies on the availability sufficient training samples. However, the collection of training samples is expensive and time consuming. Besides, there are many pretrained models on large-scale data sets, which extract the general and discriminative features. The proper reusage of low-level and midlevel representations will significantly improve the HSI classification accuracy. The large-scale ImageNet data set has three channels, but HSI contains hundreds of channels. Therefore, there are several difficulties to simply adapt the pretrained models for the classification of HSIs. In this article, heterogeneous transfer learning for HSI classification is proposed. First, a mapping layer is used to handle the issue of having different numbers of channels. Then, the model architectures and weights of the CNN trained on the ImageNet data sets are used to initialize the model and weights of the HSI classification network. Finally, a well-designed neural network is used to perform the HSI classification task. Furthermore, attention mechanism is used to adjust the feature maps due to the difference between the heterogeneous data sets. Moreover, controlled random sampling is used as another training sample selection method to test the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Experimental results on four popular hyperspectral data sets with two training sample selection strategies show that the transferred CNN obtains better classification accuracy than that of state-of-the-art methods.

Some limitations, however, exist in the literature, in aspects of data collection (sample size selected, duration of study, granularity of data), selection of variables (or combination of variables), and method of inference (the number of transportation modes to be used in the learning). This paper therefore, attempts to fully understand these aspects in the process of inference.

We first study the variables that could contribute positively to this classification, and statistically quantify their discriminatory power.

With the development of smart manufacturing, the data-driven fault diagnosis becomes hot. However, traditional methods have two shortcomings: 1) their performances depend on the good design of handcrafted features of data, but it is difficult to predesign these features and 2) they work well under a general assumption: the training data and testing data should be drawn from the same distribution, but this assumption fails in many engineering applications. Since deep learning (DL) can extract the hierarchical representation features of raw data, and transfer learning provides a good way to perform a learning task on the different but related distribution datasets, deep transfer learning (DTL) has been developed for fault diagnosis. In this paper, a new DTL method is proposed. It uses a three-layer sparse auto-encoder to extract the features of raw data, and applies the maximum mean discrepancy term to minimizing the discrepancy penalty between the features from training data and testing data. The proposed DTL is tested on the famous motor bearing dataset from the Case Western Reserve University. The results show a good improvement, and DTL achieves higher prediction accuracies on most experiments than DL.

Neural similarity naturally generalizes the convolution and enhances flexibility. Further, we consider the neural similarity learning (NSL) in order to learn the neural similarity adaptively from training data. Specifically, we propose two different ways of learning the neural similarity: static NSL and dynamic NSL. Interestingly, dynamic neural similarity makes the CNN become a dynamic inference network. By regularizing the bilinear matrix, NSL can be viewed as learning the shape of kernel and the similarity measure simultaneously. We further justify the effectiveness of NSL with a theoretical viewpoint.

Intrusion detection is the process of analysing various events in a system/network for possible presence of intrusion. The aim of an intrusion detection system is to protect the system from unauthorized access. Design of intrusion detection systems (IDS) has gained lots of importance in the recent years and has become the standard component of in network security. Intrusion detection systems operate either using anomaly based or signature based and in some cases IDS operate in a hybrid way. The data growth rate and the higher bandwidth and network speed makes it very difficult to process the data in real-time. Many researchers have focused in this area and have used data mining techniques for detecting the intrusions. Classification is a data mining technique used to predict group membership for each data instance. Classification is being used by various researchers for detection intrusions. Lot of classification algorithms have been developed for intrusion detection with respective strengths and weaknesses. This paper presents a novel classification algorithm based on distance measure and Relief-F feature weighting. The performance measures of intrusion detection are compared with the commonly used classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the proposed algorithm outperforms the above mentioned algorithms in terms of Detection Rate, Accuracy, False Alarm Rate, F-Score and Mathews Correlation Coefficient. The proposed algorithm is tested using a benchmark dataset (KDDcup99 dataset) and a real traces dataset (Kyoto 2006 + dataset). This study also intend to compare the execution time for various classifiers and the parallel performance of NADA since NADA outperforms all the other classifiers in terms of serial execution time.

The paper objective is to develop a model for recognition of bots in online social networks. To develop this model, a machine-learning algorithm \u201cRandom Forest\u201d was used. Since implementation of machine-learning algorithms requires the maximum data amount, the Twitter online social network was used to solve the problem of bot recognition. This online social network is regularly used in many studies on the recognition of bots. For learning and testing the Random Forest algorithm, a Twitter account dataset was used, which involved above 3,000 users and over 6,000 bots. While learning and testing the Random Forest algorithm, the optimal hyper-parameters of the algorithm were determined at which the highest value of the F 1 metric was reached. As a programming language that allowed the above actions to be implemented, was chosen Python, which is frequently used in solving problems related to machine learning. To compare the developed model with the other authors\u2019 models, testing was based on the two Twitter account datasets, which involved as many as half of bots and half of real users. As a result of testing on these datasets, F 1 -metrics of 0.973 and 0.923 were obtained. The obtained F 1 -metric values are quite high as compared with the papers of other authors.

Different machine learning techniques can be applied to identify classes of skin disease. Herein, we have applied machine learning algorithms to categorize classes of skin disease using ensemble techniques, and then a feature selection method is utilized to compare the results obtained. Method In the proposed study, we present a new method which applies six different data mining classification techniques, and then develop an ensemble approach using Bagging, AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting classifier techniques to predict classes of skin disease. Furthermore, a feature importance method is utilized to select the most salient 15 features which will play a major role in prediction. A subset of the original dataset is obtained after selecting the 15 features, to compare the results of six machine learning techniques, and an ensemble approach is applied to the entire dataset. Results The ensemble method is compared with the subset obtained from the feature selection method. The outcome shows that the dermatological prediction accuracy of the test dataset is increased as compared to the use of an individual classifier, and improved accuracy is obtained as compared with the feature selection subset method. Conclusion The ensemble method and feature selection applied to dermatology datasets yields a better performance as compared to individual classifier algorithms.

In large state spaces, however, discriminative training can be expensive, because it often requires many calls to forward-backward. Beam search is a standard heuristic for controlling complexity during Viterbi decoding, but during forward-backward, standard beam heuristics can be dangerous, as they can make training unstable. The authors introduce sparse forward-backward, a variational perspective on beam methods that uses an approximating mixture of Kronecker delta functions. This motivates a novel minimum-divergence beam criterion based on minimizing Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the respective marginal distributions. This beam selection approach is not only more efficient for Viterbi decoding, but also more stable within sparse forward-backward training.

This QP leads to higher computational cost. Least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), as a variant of SVM, tries to avoid the above shortcoming and obtain an analytical solution directly from solving a set of linear equations instead of QP. Both SVM and LS-SVM operate directly on patterns represented by vector, i.e., before applying SVM or LS-SVM to a pattern, any non-vector pattern such as an image has to be first vectorized into a vector pattern by some techniques like concatenation. However, some implicit structural or local contextual information may be lost in this transformation. Moreover, as the dimension d of the weight vector in SVM or LS-SVM with the linear kernel is equal to the dimension d 1 \u00d7 d 2 of the original input pattern, as a result, the higher the dimension of a vector pattern is, the more space is needed for storing it. In this paper, inspired by the method of feature extraction directly based on matrix patterns and the advantages of LS-SVM, we propose a new classifier design method based on matrix patterns, called MatLSSVM, such that the new method can not only directly operate on original matrix patterns, but also efficiently reduce memory for the weight vector (d) from d 1 \u00d7 d 2 to d 1 + d 2. However like LS-SVM, MatLSSVM inherits LS-SVM's existence of unclassifiable regions when extended to multi-class problems. Thus with the fuzzy version of LS-SVM, a corresponding fuzzy version of MatLSSVM (MatFLSSVM) is further proposed to remove unclassifiable regions effectively for multi-class problems. Experimental results on some benchmark datasets show that the proposed method is competitive in classification performance compared to LS-SVM, fuzzy LS-SVM (FLS-SVM), more-recent MatPCA and MatFLDA.

Meanwhile, latent semantic models such as LSA and LDA are popular and effective methods to extract discriminative semantic features of high dimensional dyadic data. In this paper, we present a method to combine these two techniques together by introducing a new matrix tri-factorization based formulation for semi-supervised latent semantic learning, which can incorporate labeled information into traditional unsupervised learning of latent semantics. Our inspiration for multi-task semantic feature learning comes from two facts, i.e., 1) multiple tasks generally share a set of common latent semantics, and 2) a semantic usually has a stable indication of categories no matter which task it is from. Thus to make multiple tasks learn from each other we wish to share the associations between categories and those common semantics among tasks. Along this line, we propose a novel joint Nonnegative matrix tri-factorization framework with the aforesaid associations shared among tasks in the form of a semantic-category relation matrix. Our new formulation for multi-task learning can simultaneously learn (1) discriminative semantic features of each task, (2) predictive structure and categories of unlabeled data in each task, (3) common semantics shared among tasks and specific semantics exclusive to each task. We give alternating iterative algorithm to optimize our objective and theoretically show its convergence.

We evaluate the performance of the cGAN method in terms of perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), short-time objective intelligibility (STOI), and equal error rate (EER) of speaker verification (an example application).

Machine learning (ML) based NER methods have shown good performance in recognizing entities in clinical text. Algorithms and features are two important factors that largely affect the performance of ML-based NER systems. Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), a sequential labelling algorithm, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), which is based on large margin theory, are two typical machine learning algorithms that have been widely applied to clinical NER tasks. For features, syntactic and semantic information of context words has often been used in clinical NER systems. However, Structural Support Vector Machines (SSVMs), an algorithm that combines the advantages of both CRFs and SVMs, and word representation features, which contain word-level back-off information over large unlabelled corpus by unsupervised algorithms, have not been extensively investigated for clinical text processing. Therefore, the primary goal of this study is to evaluate the use of SSVMs and word representation features in clinical NER tasks. In this study, we developed SSVMs-based NER systems to recognize clinical entities in hospital discharge summaries, using the data set from the concept extration task in the 2010 i2b2 NLP challenge. We compared the performance of CRFs and SSVMs-based NER classifiers with the same feature sets. Furthermore, we extracted two different types of word representation features (clustering-based representation features and distributional representation features) and integrated them with the SSVMs-based clinical NER system. We then reported the performance of SSVM-based NER systems with different types of word representation features. Using the same training (N = 27,837) and test (N = 45,009) sets in the challenge, our evaluation showed that the SSVMs-based NER systems achieved better performance than the CRFs-based systems for clinical entity recognition, when same features were used. Both types of word representation features (clustering-based and distributional representations) improved the performance of ML-based NER systems. By combining two different types of word representation features together with SSVMs, our system achieved a highest F-measure of 85.82%, which outperformed the best system reported in the challenge by 0.6%.

Although conventional machine learning could be a solution, it takes much time for researchers to determine features and contents of digital images, and the accuracy tends to be unsatisfactory. On the other hand, deep learning can automatically determine features and contents of various objects from digital images. Therefore, this research aims to automatically detect each object as an object and its position from digital images by using deep learning. Since deep learning usually requires a very large amount of dataset, this research has adopted deep learning with transfer learning, which enables object detection even if the dataset is not very large.

With a frequency of 1kHz, 1/4th cycle of instantaneous values of currents and voltages of all phases at the relying end are fed to Support Vector Machine(SVM). The SVM detects fault type accurately using 3 milliseconds of post-fault data and reduces the fault clearing time which improves the system stability and power transfer capability. The performance of relaying scheme has been checked with a typical 765kV Indian transmission System which is simulated using the Electromagnetic Transients Program(EMTP) developed by authors in which the distributed parameter line model is used. More than 15,000 different short circuit fault cases are simulated by varying fault location, fault impedance, fault incidence angle and fault type to train the SVM for high speed accurate relaying.

There exist remote sensing and GIS-based methods for mapping potential mosquito inhabitants and locations that are prone to mosquito-borne diseases, but these methods generally do not account for species-wise identification of mosquitoes in closed-perimeter regions. Traditional methods for mosquito classification involve highly manual processes requiring tedious sample collection and supervised laboratory analysis. In this research work, we present the design and experimental validation of an automated vision-based mosquito classification module that can deploy in closed-perimeter mosquito inhabitants. The module is capable of identifying mosquitoes from other bugs such as bees and flies by extracting the morphological features, followed by support vector machine-based classification. In addition, this paper presents the results of three variants of support vector machine classifier in the context of mosquito classification problem. This vision-based approach to the mosquito classification problem presents an efficient alternative to the conventional methods for mosquito surveillance, mapping and sample image collection.

Then, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is applied to design a predictive model to identify exact attack types (among DoS, U2R, R2L, and Probes). Since feature extraction is an important step for designing an efficient predictive model, we used Higuchi fractal dimension and statistical measures (mean, median, and standard deviation) with an overlapping sliding window operation to extract features. Among the extracted features, only significant features are selected by applying statistical analysis and used to design a predictive model.

In contrast to the SVM classifier, we approximate classes with affine hulls of their class samples rather than convex hulls, which may be unrealistically tight in high-dimensional spaces. To find the best separating hyperplane between any pair of classes approximated with the affine hulls, we first compute the closest points on the affine hulls and connect these two points with a line segment. The optimal separating hyperplane is chosen to be the hyperplane that is orthogonal to the line segment and bisects the line. To allow soft margin solutions, we first reduce affine hulls in order to alleviate the effects of outliers and then search for the best separating hyperplane between these reduced models. Multi-class classification problems are dealt with constructing and combining several binary classifiers as in SVM.

However, it is non-trivial to derive gradient boosting algorithms for CRFs due to the dense Hessian matrices introduced by variable dependencies. Existing approaches thus use only rst-order information when optimizing likelihood, and hence face convergence issues. We incorporate second-order information by deriving a Markov Chain mixing rate bound to quantify the dependencies, and introduce a gradient boosting algorithm that iteratively optimizes an adaptive upper bound of the objective function.

To give a classical example, classification and regression trees are easy to understand and interpret. Tree ensembles like Random Forests provide usually more accurate predictions. Yet tree ensembles are also more difficult to analyze than single trees and are often criticized, perhaps unfairly, as `black box' predictors. Node harvest is trying to reconcile the two aims of interpretability and predictive accuracy by combining positive aspects of trees and tree ensembles. Results are very sparse and interpretable and predictive accuracy is extremely competitive, especially for low signal-to-noise data. The procedure is simple: an initial set of a few thousand nodes is generated randomly. If a new observation falls into just a single node, its prediction is the mean response of all training observation within this node, identical to a tree-like prediction. A new observation falls typically into several nodes and its prediction is then the weighted average of the mean responses across all these nodes. The only role of node harvest is to `pick' the right nodes from the initial large ensemble of nodes by choosing node weights, which amounts in the proposed algorithm to a quadratic programming problem with linear inequality constraints. The solution is sparse in the sense that only very few nodes are selected with a nonzero weight. This sparsity is not explicitly enforced. Maybe surprisingly, it is not necessary to select a tuning parameter for optimal predictive accuracy. Node harvest can handle mixed data and missing values and is shown to be simple to interpret and competitive in predictive accuracy on a variety of data sets.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": "0910.2145", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1214/10-AOAS367", "venue": "Annals of Applied Statistics 2010, Vol. 4, No. 4, 2049-2072", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["5949716", "12470146", "59849738", "2833811", "14349123", "207738357", "27026167", "89141", "60993494", "2429822", "14459236", "121570279", "1836349", "14723701", "16884658", "10822421", "198120310", "22628078", "2003897", "140584745", "2469856", "583205", "11771572", "6130150", "8529157", "16162039", "5895004", "67731364"], "inbound_citations": ["23131216", "64143314", "195886033", "15635460", "195071231", "11319000", "88521439", "53080501", "17699665", "16968877", "3506180", "196657232", "155980866", "12374580", "173990409", "214794947", "434476", "52043008", "211244406", "61748", "6280148", "85528450", "201070843"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18898962"}

However, existing models can only generate real-valued piano-rolls and require further post-processing, such as hard thresholding (HT) or Bernoulli sampling (BS), to obtain the final binary-valued results. In this paper, we study whether we can have a convolutional GAN model that directly creates binary-valued piano-rolls by using binary neurons. Specifically, we propose to append to the generator an additional refiner network, which uses binary neurons at the output layer. The whole network is trained in two stages. Firstly, the generator and the discriminator are pretrained. Then, the refiner network is trained along with the discriminator to learn to binarize the real-valued piano-rolls the pretrained generator creates. Experimental results show that using binary neurons instead of HT or BS indeed leads to better results in a number of objective measures. Moreover, deterministic binary neurons perform better than stochastic ones in both objective measures and a subjective test.

High-dimensional datasets require new effective variable selection methods to be developed. This study implements an advanced evolutionary variable selection method which is applied for cardiovascular predictive modeling. The epidemiological follow-up study KIHD (Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study) was used to compare the designed variable selection method based on an evolutionary search with conventional stepwise selection. The sample contains in total 433 predictor variables and a response variable indicating incidents of cardiovascular diseases for 1465 study subjects.ResultsThe effectiveness of variable selection methods was investigated in combination with two models: Generalized Linear Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine. We managed to decrease the number of variables from 433 to 38 and save the predictive ability of the models used. Their performance was evaluated with an F-score metric. At most, we gained 65.6% and 67.4% of the F-score before and after variable selection respectively. All the results were averaged over 5-folds of a cross-validation procedure.ConclusionsThe presented evolutionary variable selection method allows a reduced set of variables to be chosen which are relevant to predicting cardiovascular diseases. A reference list of the most meaningful variables is introduced to be used as a basis for new epidemiological studies.

Previous theoretical investigation has shown that brain networks exhibit an intermediate state of full coherence and random firing, which is suitable for reservoir computing. However, how reservoir performance is influenced by connectivity, especially which revealed in recent connectomics analysis of brain networks, remains unclear. Here, we constructed modular networks of integrate-and-fire neurons and investigated the effect of modular structure and excitatory-inhibitory neuron ratio on network dynamics. The dynamics were evaluated based on the following three measures: synchronous bursting frequency, mean correlation, and functional complexity. We found that in a purely excitatory network, the complexity was independent of the modularity of the network. On the other hand, networks with inhibitory neurons exhibited complex network activity when the modularity was high.

Recently, the bilinear feature interaction has been proved effective in generating powerful high-order representation with spatially invariant information. However, the existing methods apply a fixed feature interaction strategy to all samples, which ignore the image and region heterogeneity in a dataset. To this end, we propose a generalized feature interaction method, named Adaptive Bilinear Pooling (ABP), which can adaptively infer a suitable pooling strategy for a given sample based on image content. Specifically, ABP consists of two learning strategies: p-order learning (P-net) and spatial attention learning (S-net). The p-order learning predicts an optimal exponential coefficient rather than a fixed order number to extract moderate visual information from an image. The spatial attention learning aims to infer a weighted score that measures the importance of each local region, which can compact the image representations. To make ABP compatible with kernelized bilinear feature interaction, a crossed two-branch structure is utilized to combine the P-net and S-net. This structure can facilitate complementary information exchange between two different visual branches. The experiments on three widely used benchmarks, including fine-grained object classification and action recognition, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3338533.3366567", "venue": null, "journal": "Proceedings of the ACM Multimedia Asia", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3000563843", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["22941565", "15022910", "206595459", "407011", "10685040", "1532984", "6291314", "266124", "43209", "13441936", "2053770", "14342571", "12529686", "1331231", "8419023", "52832798", "13951793", "8213197", "10605093", "8320451", "16119123", "153312732", "29676877", "41795057", "214553596", "50788959", "52959961", "64675975"], "inbound_citations": ["212639044"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210865241"}

The levels of serum miRNAs were performed by quantitative PCR in 138 asthmatics and 39 healthy subjects. Regression analysis and Random Forest models were performed. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: We found a set of miRNAs whose expression differs between eosinophils from asthmatics and healthy subjects. These miRNAs can classify asthmatics into two clusters that differed in the number of eosinophils and periostin concentration in serum. Some of these miRNAs were also confirmed in sera, as miR-185-5p which discriminates asthmatics from healthy subjects. Together with other two miRNAs, miR-185-5p allowed us to create a logistic regression model to discriminate better both conditions and a Random Forest model that can even sort the asthmatics into intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, and severe persistent asthma. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Our data show that miRNAs profile in eosinophils can be used as asthma diagnosis biomarker in serum and that this profile is able to rank asthma severity.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30040124", "doi": "10.1111/all.13570", "venue": null, "journal": "Allergy", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2884383875", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["5451867", "22188675", "205665821", "205389234", "18385151", "19075653", "13791378", "28683773", "20905712", "25926339", "46851666", "338043", "1619132", "7614433", "18622449", "215596658", "3093707", "10050839", "3977617", "40314632", "953113", "23196921", "21791109", "7229814", "215141614", "3964970", "7696834", "38201707", "23145020", "207712100", "34237006", "207589054", "3802663", "24559141", "7281161", "6949859", "1835590", "215526497", "22396204", "39180758", "1984939", "15913188"], "inbound_citations": ["73726692", "148569392", "146810919", "207963293", "145864366"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:51713791"}

It maps a MeshFace photo to a representation vector, and then decodes the vector to a RGB ID photo.

However, limited by its simplicity, the local structure of data is easy to neglect, and many methods have considered using orthogonal constraint for preserving more local information. Another major drawback of LSR is that the loss function between soft regression results and hard target values cannot precisely reflect the classification ability; thus, the idea of the large margin constraint is put forward. As a consequence, we pay attention to the concepts of large margin and orthogonal constraint to propose a novel algorithm, orthogonal least squares regression with large margin (OLSLM), for multiclass classification in this letter. The core task of this algorithm is to learn regression targets from data and an orthogonal transformation matrix simultaneously such that the proposed model not only ensures every data point can be correctly classified with a large margin than conventional least squares regression, but also can preserve more local data structure information in the subspace. Our efficient optimization method for solving the large margin constraint and orthogonal constraint iteratively proved to be convergent in both theory and practice. We also apply the large margin constraint in the process of generating a sparse learning model for feature selection via joint [Formula: see text]-norm minimization on both loss function and regularization terms.

Finite element (FE) simulations were conducted for the LV with different material properties to obtain a training set. A hyperelastic fiber-reinforced material model was used to describe the passive behavior of the myocardium during diastole. The active behavior of the heart resulting from myofiber contractions was added to the passive tissue during systole. The active and passive properties govern the LV constitutive equation. These mechanical properties were altered using optimal Latin hypercube design of experiments to obtain training FE models with varied active properties (volume and pressure predictions) and varied passive properties (stress predictions). For prediction of LV pressures, we used eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGboost) and Cubist, and XGBoost was used for predictions of LV pressures, volumes as well as LV stresses. The LV pressure and volume results obtained from ML were similar to FE computations. The ML results could capture the shape of LV pressure as well as LV pressure-volume loops. The results predicted by Cubist were smoother than those from XGBoost. The mean absolute errors were as follows: XGBoost volume: 1.734 \u00b1 0.584 ml, XGBoost pressure: 1.544 \u00b1 0.298 mmHg, Cubist volume: 1.495 \u00b1 0.260 ml, Cubist pressure: 1.623 \u00b1 0.191 mmHg, myofiber stress: 0.334 \u00b1 0.228 kPa, cross myofiber stress: 0.075 \u00b1 0.024 kPa, and shear stress: 0.050 \u00b1 0.032 kPa. The simulation results show ML can predict LV mechanics much faster than the FE method. The ML model can be used as a tool to predict LV behavior. Training of our ML model based on a large group of subjects can improve its predictability for real world applications.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6941671", "pubmed_id": "31903394", "doi": "10.3389/fphy.2019.00117", "venue": "Front.

However, this new technology produces about 55,000 images for each patient and poses a great burden on the professional clinicians to review these images, thus an automatic computer-aided diagnosis technique is in high demand. In this paper, we propose a new feature integrating the Gabor filter and Monogenic-Local Binary Pattern (M-LBP) methods in color components for polyp detection. The new feature not only can represent shape and edge information under multi-resolution, but also preserve color information. The proposed method is composed of the following steps: the first step is to transform the original WCE images into different color space and extract the corresponding Gabor responses of the color components. Next the M_LBP descriptors applied on the resulting Gabor responses are concatenated together to characterize the images. Finally we apply Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce feature dimensions and conduct experiments with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier on a set of images containing 436 polyp images and 436 normal images. The experimental results achieved an encouraging polyp detection accuracy of 91.43%, showing that the new feature provides a good characterization and description of the WCE images for polyp classification tasks.

Aim: This study aims to provide a critical analysis of text mining techniques used to support the citation screening stage of the systematic review process. Method: We critically re-reviewed papers included in a previous systematic review which addressed the use of text mining methods to support the screening of papers for inclusion in a review. The previous review did not provide a detailed analysis of the text mining methods used. We focus on the availability in the papers of information about the text mining methods employed, including the description and explanation of the methods, parameter settings, assessment of the appropriateness of their application given the size and dimensionality of the data used, performance on training, testing and validation data sets, and further information that may support the reproducibility of the included studies. Results: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB) and Committee of classifiers (Ensemble) are the most used classification algorithms. In all of the studies, features were represented with Bag-of-Words (BOW) using both binary features (28%) and term frequency (66%). Five studies experimented with n-grams with n between 2 and 4, but mostly the unigram was used. \u03c72, information gain and tf-idf were the most commonly used feature selection techniques. Feature extraction was rarely used although LDA and topic modelling were used. Recall, precision, F and AUC were the most used metrics and cross validation was also well used. More than half of the studies used a corpus size of below 1,000 documents for their experiments while corpus size for around 80% of the studies was 3,000 or fewer documents. The major common ground we found for comparing performance assessment based on independent replication of studies was the use of the same dataset but a sound performance comparison could not be established because the studies had little else in common. In most of the studies, insufficient information was reported to enable independent replication. The studies analysed generally did not include any discussion of the statistical appropriateness of the text mining method that they applied. In the case of applications of SVM, none of the studies report the number of support vectors that they found to indicate the complexity of the prediction engine that they use, making it impossible to judge the extent to which over-fitting might account for the good performance results. Conclusions: There is yet to be concrete evidence about the effectiveness of text mining algorithms regarding their use in the automation of citation screening in systematic reviews. The studies indicate that options are still being explored, but there is a need for better reporting as well as more explicit process details and access to datasets to facilitate study replication for evidence strengthening. In general, the reader often gets the impression that text mining algorithms were applied as magic tools in the reviewed papers, relying on default settings or default optimization of available machine learning toolboxes without an in-depth understanding of the statistical validity and appropriateness of such tools for text mining purposes.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/2915970.2915982", "venue": "EASE '16", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2406978180", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["12312186", "14774186", "20951306", "818697", "16888019", "17066085", "10973589", "26299669", "43544056", "501322", "1313623", "206983299", "43544056", "16815236", "13091079", "13431314", "11848702", "195704706", "19822594", "16837556", "11484917", "13972483", "13972483", "14812543", "1621458", "13790381", "464097", "6091497", "16989867", "41601515", "55441078", "113102314", "8165288", "13861754", "6389019", "14990423", "58506268", "23855502", "23855502", "215223318", "62726520", "47128183", "7050998", "2448628", "61924377", "1621178", "7489217", "59891909", "59891909", "3050992", "26880334", "28045459", "34096915", "3138739", "12128369", "18853335", "15234662", "215617977", "14070935", "44773968", "14009304", "1813732", "17356665", "9531202", "7698952", "4474084", "5626827", "12567481", "9077510"], "inbound_citations": ["174804287", "207944623", "70220016", "208880541", "13917185", "15354918", "204897973", "181516667", "4165744"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13190589"}

One major contribution has been the development of an empirical and rule-based modeling approach which addresses two of the major challenges associated with mapping forest disturbance. The first challenge is that no single spectral band or index responds consistently to all disturbance types. To overcome this challenge we use a new, non-parametric shape-fitting algorithm to derive pixel-level temporal change metrics (e.g. timing, magnitude, duration) from four different types of Landsat trajectories. By incorporating both shortwave-infrared data (e.g. Landsat band 5) and near-infrared-based vegetation indices (e.g. NDVI, NBR) we increase capture of subtle changes which alter forest structure and/or canopy leaf area. The second challenge is that certain types of disturbance are influenced by topographic and biophysical factors which are not inherently captured by optical remote sensing data. To overcome this challenge we use Random Forest models to integrate multiple spectral and non-spectral predictor variables to map fires, harvests, wind damage, as well as stress brought on by insect/disease outbreaks and land use conversion resulting in permanent forest cover loss. In this presentation we show results from 10 Landsat scenes representing a diverse array of causal agents, forest types, and forest prevalence levels found across the country. Using these example scenes we discuss the construction and importance of various predictor variables, as well as examine how model prediction accuracy varies as a function of geographic location, forest type and input training data.

(2004). Altern Lab Anim 32:275\u2013307). Our goals were to (1) assess the accuracy of this model with pharmaceuticals, and (2) to use the data to develop a more accurate prediction model. Methods: Sixty-one chemicals of known in vivo activity were tested. They were part of the ECVAM validation set (N = 13), commercially available pharmaceuticals (N = 31), and Pfizer chemicals that did not reach the market, but for which developmental toxicity data were available (N = 17). They were tested according to the ECVAM procedures. Fifty-seven of these chemicals were used for Random Forest modeling to develop an alternate model with the goal of using surrogate endpoints for simplified assessments and to improve the predictivity of the model. Results: Using part of the ECVAM chemical test set, the ECVAM prediction model was 77% accurate. This approximated what was reported in the validation study (80%; Piersma et al. (2004). Altern Lab Anim 32:275\u2013307). However, when confronted with novel chemicals, the accuracy of the linear discriminant model dropped to 56%. In an attempt to improve this performance, we used a Random Forest model that provided rankings and confidence estimates. Although the model used simpler endpoints, its performance was no better than the ECVAM linear discriminant model. Conclusions: This study confirms previous concerns about the applicability of the ECVAM prediction model to a more diverse chemical set, and underscores the challenges associated with developing embryotoxicity prediction models.

Two machine learning algorithms, Random Forest and K-nearest neighbor, were used. The prediction accuracies were examined by five-fold cross-validation on the genotype-phenotype datasets. A supervised machine learning approach for automatic prediction of drug resistance was developed to handle genotype-phenotype datasets of HIV protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT). It predicts the drug resistance phenotype and its relative severity from a query sequence. The accuracy of the classification was higher than 0.973 for eight PR inhibitors and 0.986 for ten RT inhibitors, respectively. The overall cross-validated regression R(2)-values for the severity of drug resistance were 0.772-0.953 for 8 PR inhibitors and 0.773-0.995 for 10 RT inhibitors. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Machine learning using a unified encoding of sequence and protein structure as a feature vector provides an accurate prediction of drug resistance from genotype data.

First, we propose an automatic speaker recognition approach especially adapted to identify dysarthric speakers. Secondly, we suggest a method for the automatic assessment of the dysarthria severity level. For this purpose, a model simulating the external, middle and inner parts of the ear is presented. This ear model provides relevant auditory-based cues that are combined with the usual Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) to represent atypical speech utterances. The experiments are carried out by using data of both Nemours and Torgo databases of dysarthric speech. Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and hybrid GMM/SVM systems are tested and compared in the context of dysarthric speaker identification and assessment.

All these problems were originally tackled by means of standard cameras, but the intrinsic ambiguity in the bidimensional images led to the development of depth cameras technologies. Stereo vision was first introduced to provide an estimate of the 3D geometry of the scene. Structured light depth cameras were developed to use the same concepts of stereo vision but overcome some of the problems of passive technologies. Finally, Time-of-Flight (ToF) depth cameras solve the same depth estimation problem by using a different technology. ::: ::: This thesis focuses on the acquisition of depth data from multiple sensors and presents techniques to efficiently combine the information of different acquisition systems. The three main technologies developed to provide depth estimation are first reviewed, presenting operating principles and practical issues of each family of sensors. The use of multiple sensors then is investigated, providing practical solutions to the problem of 3D reconstruction and gesture recognition. Data from stereo vision systems and ToF depth cameras are combined together to provide a higher quality depth map. A confidence measure of depth data from the two systems is used to guide the depth data fusion. The lack of datasets with data from multiple sensors is addressed by proposing a system for the collection of data and ground truth depth, and a tool to generate synthetic data from standard cameras and ToF depth cameras. For gesture recognition, a depth camera is paired with a Leap Motion device to boost the performance of the recognition task.

Machine learning approaches to genotype-phenotype mapping may significantly improve Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) results by explicitly focusing on predictivity and optimal feature selection in a multivariate setting. It is however essential that stringent and well documented Data Analysis Protocols (DAP) are used to control sources of variability and ensure reproducibility of results. We present a genome-to-phenotype pipeline of machine learning modules for quantitative phenotype prediction. The pipeline can be applied for the direct use of whole-genome information in functional studies. As a realistic example, the problem of fitting complex phenotypic traits in heterogeneous stock mice from single nucleotide polymorphims (SNPs) is here considered.MethodsThe core element in the pipeline is the L1L2 regularization method based on the na\u00efve elastic net. The method gives at the same time a regression model and a dimensionality reduction procedure suitable for correlated features. Model and SNP markers are selected through a DAP originally developed in the MAQC-II collaborative initiative of the U.S. FDA for the identification of clinical biomarkers from microarray data. The L1L2 approach is compared with standard Support Vector Regression (SVR) and with Recursive Jump Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC). Algebraic indicators of stability of partial lists are used for model selection; the final panel of markers is obtained by a procedure at the chromosome scale, termed \u2019saturation\u2019, to recover SNPs in Linkage Disequilibrium with those selected.ResultsWith respect to both MCMC and SVR, comparable accuracies are obtained by the L1L2 pipeline. Good agreement is also found between SNPs selected by the L1L2 algorithms and candidate loci previously identified by a standard GWAS. The combination of L1L2-based feature selection with a saturation procedure tackles the issue of neglecting highly correlated features that affects many feature selection algorithms.ConclusionsThe L1L2 pipeline has proven effective in terms of marker selection and prediction accuracy.

Semidefinite programming is sometimes used to enforce this constraint, but does not scale well. BOOSTMETRIC is instead based on a key observation that any positive semidefinite matrix can be decomposed into a linear positive combination of trace-one rank-one matrices. BOOSTMETRIC thus uses rank-one positive semidefinite matrices as weak learners within an efficient and scalable boosting-based learning process.

Most existing approaches are incapable of well modeling the inherent correlations and interactions between them, resulting in the loss of the latent consensus structure information. To alleviate this problem, we propose a learning to rank approach that simultaneously obtains a set of deep linear features and constructs structure-aware ranking models in a joint learning framework. Specifically, the deep linear feature learning corresponds to a series of matrix factorization tasks in a hierarchical manner, while the learning-to-rank part concentrates on building a ranking model that effectively encodes the intrinsic ranking information by structural SVM learning. Through a joint learning mechanism, the two parts are mutually reinforced in our approach, and meanwhile their underlying interaction relationships are implicitly reflected by solving an alternating optimization problem. Due to the intrinsic correlations among different queries (i.e., similar queries for similar ranking lists), we further formulate the learning-to-rank problem as a multi-task problem, which is associated with a set of mutually related query-specific learning-to-rank subproblems. For computational efficiency and scalability, we design a MapReduce-based parallelization approach to speed up the learning processes.

Methods Two-year, prospective longitudinal study, where 81 patients (9-17 years of age) with a FE-EOP and stable diagnosis at follow-up and 41 age and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) were included. Structured diagnostic interviews, clinical and cognitive scales, a MRI scan and biochemical tests were conducted at baseline.

Jackknifing was used to validate the algorithms and to calculate performance estimates. Enhanced-Recursive Feature Elimination was performed in order to gain information about the predictive weight for diagnosis of each variable. Results The SSD-versus-non-SSD classifier achieved an overall accuracy of 83.1%, sensitivity of 86.6% and specificity of 77.8%.

In the literature, one challenge is how to propagate information in heterogeneous networks comprising several subnetworks, each of which has its own cluster structures that need to be explored independently. In this paper, we introduce an intutitive algorithm MINProp (Mutual Interaction-based Network Propagation) and a simple regularization framework for propagating information between subnetworks in a heterogeneous network. MINProp sequentially performs label propagation on each individual subnetwork with the current label information derived from the other subnetworks and repeats this step until convergence to the global optimal solution to the convex objective function of the regularization framework. The independent label propagation on each subnetwork explores the cluster structure in the subnetwork. The label information from the other subnetworks is used to capture mutual interactions (bicluster structures) between the vertices in each pair of the subnetworks. MINProp algorithm is applied to disease gene discovery from a heterogeneus network of disease phenotypes and genes. In the experiments, MINProp significantly output-performed the original label propagation algorithm on a single network and the state-of-the-art methods for discovering disease genes.

Traditional proposals usually identify the land cover classes from general related groups such as different tree species or different crop varieties. Additionally, these proposals commonly use information from a precise time span or season, not accounting for the variability of the data over the entire year, specially in regions with several seasons. In this work, we propose a multi-temporal classification system to identify and represent diverse land cover classes over any period of the entire year by using Sentinel-2 satellite image data. To this end, 526 representative samples were labelled from 5 complex and variable different land cover types over the Special Area of Conservation (SAC) Betanzos-Mandeo in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula. The method achieves a satisfactory mean accuracy value of 84.0% for the testing set using the best configuration with a radial Support Vector Machine classifier.

Although news reports provide a source of information that gives access to historical and international events, they have limitations like the coverage of small protest events and the delay in reporting incidents. This research explores the use of social media posts, especially Twitter, to build protest repression dataset and to overcome the limitations of using new reports. We use supervised machine learning models with a dataset of tweets that were sent during the Turkish Gezi Park protest in 2013 to detect tweets that report protest repression events. To accomplish this, we run a crowdsourcing experiment to build a training dataset of tweets and their corresponding labels as protest-related or not and violent or not. Then, we use this dataset to train two baseline machine learning models: Support Vector Machine(SVM) and Multinomial Naive Bayes(MNB) with different text representation models: Bag of Words(BOW), TF-IDF and word Embedding(WE). The empirical results of the experiments show that Crowdsourcing with the right settings and quality measures provides a fast and cheap way to hand label datasets to train machine learning models.

Furthermore, we developed a targeted liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS) with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method to quantify a six compound panel (hypoxanthine, carnitine, acetylcarnitine, proline, taurine, and citrulline) identified in a previous training cohort at 7 d after a 4 Gy exposure. The highest sensitivity and specificity for classifying exposure at 7 d after a 4 Gy exposure included carnitine and acetylcarnitine in urine and taurine, carnitine, and hypoxanthine in serum. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis using combined compounds show excellent sensitivity and specificity in urine (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.99) and serum (AUC = 0.95).

Examples are neuronal assemblies, whose connection structures develop over time and are distributed over different brain areas. In situ concepts representations cannot be copied or duplicated because that will disrupt their connection structure, and thus the meaning of these concepts. Higher-level cognitive processes, as found in language and reasoning, can be performed with in situ concepts by embedding them in specialized neurally inspired \"blackboards.\" The interactions between the in situ concepts and the blackboards form the basis for in situ concept computing architectures. In these architectures, memory (concepts) and processing are interwoven, in contrast with the separation between memory and processing found in Von Neumann architectures. Because the further development of Von Neumann computing (more, faster, yet power limited) is questionable, in situ concept computing might be an alternative for concept-based computing. In situ concept computing will be illustrated with a recently developed BABI reasoning task. Neurorobotics can play an important role in the development of in situ concept computing because of the development of in situ concept representations derived in scenarios as needed for reasoning tasks.

{"paper_id": "108387340", "title": "A quantitative intraday trading strategy based on regression algorithms", "authors": [{"first": "Yuxia", "middle": [], "last": "Yan", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "My thesis is a quantitative intraday trading strategy based on regression algorithms. The main strategies used to generate trading signals for the stock market are buying and holding, intraday trading, scalping trading, weekly trading and so on. These trading strategies can be addressed by using technical analysis or fundamental analysis. Fundamental analysis attempts to use data such as revenue, expenses, growth prospects and competitive landscape to calculate the intrinsic value of stocks, while technical analysis uses past market activities and stock price trends to predict future activities. The fundamental uses a long-term approach of market analysis. Therefore, long-term investors often use fundamental analysis because it helps them to choose assets that increase in value over time. Technical analysis uses a relatively short-term method to analyze the market and use it for weeks, days or even minutes. So it is more commonly used by daily traders because it aims to select assets that can be sold to others at higher prices in the short term. The thesis work focuses on investigating the use of regression algorithms to generate trading signals for intraday stock trading. The proposed strategy separately analyzes the historical prices of one stock at a time and discovers patterns relevant for predict the future price of the stock in the next day. The proposed strategy automatically detects the right direction of investment (long- or short-selling) and decides whether to open an intraday trade or not on a given stock based on the expected profit. Therefore, potentially one trading signal per day is generated in case the potential profit of the recommended trade is sufficiently high. In this thesis work I conducted a large campaign of experiments on data acquired from the main Italian stock market index (FTSE MIB). To get significant results, we tested our trading strategies in different years (2011, 2013, and 2015), which correspond to different market conditions. We tested a variety of different algorithms in order to look for profitable trend forecasting models by analyzing the prediction performance and financial performance of the proposed models based on different algorithms, such as support vector machines, RepTree, Linear regression, NeuralNet and Random Forest. We tuned the configuration setting of each algorithm in order to achieve better prediction results. We tested also two baseline strategies: random signal generation and follow the trend of the last market day. For random strategy, I generate in Excel a new column where a random value (up, down, or no-action) is stored. Then, I compute the performance according to these values, not close price. The random value is the target that I evaluated. Baseline strategy is an simple strategy for regression that we developed. Specifically, the simple strategy is used to forecast the same direction as the one happened in the last day. The strategy is operated by constructing a sliding window, then the window will advance one day every time. For each sliding window, if you want to predict the trend (up, down or no action) of every stock on specific time point, you just need to evaluate the trend in the previous time point, then your prediction will be the same to the trend of the previous time point. By running experiments in different models and strategies, we found that, it is successful for day ahead forecasting of daily stock price movements by using these techniques. In addition, the prediction performance and the financial performance of the proposed models were verified and compared. The results show that The RepTree-based prediction model has higher prediction accuracy and financial performance than other models. We can conclude that prediction methods based on regression models in intraday trading can produce more efficient prediction systems than naive approaches.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2924847636", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["28649399", "8976873", "23987471", "57343526", "18863598", "153591054", "55685405", "5471216", "9364031", "11121404", "142747336", "14330599", "8025379", "34512242", "40729992", "37312235"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:108387340"}

As an illustration, we focus on the problem of characterising the sorption properties of hydrogen storage materials. We consider the composite materials La 2 Mg 17 - x wt% Z with Z = LaNi 5 and Z = MmNi 4.5 Al 0.5 for various values of x. We use training data on the desorbed amount of hydrogen for two different temperatures and different time of desorption. These training data are used to train a multilayer network which is then used to predict the amount of released hydrogen for new desorption temperature, and desorption time. Our results show that for both materials with different values of x, the network is able to learn the non-linear desorption characteristics quite successfully. Hence, for different temperatures and desorption time, we are able to predict the dehydriding kinetics and storage capacity of hydrogen storage materials without doing the actual experiments.", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s521-001-8048-8", "venue": "Neural Computing & Applications", "journal": "Neural Computing & Applications", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2012105374", "mag_field_of_study": ["Materials Science", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["137253750", "38623065", "60577818"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:35886240"}

However, the solution of ELM is dense and plenty of storage space and training time are required for large-scale applications. Traditional ELM method learns the output weights through the calculation of matrix inverse. In this paper, we propose a sparse ELM (SELM) method and the sparsity of output weights can reduce the storage space and training time. Furthermore, SELM updates the output weights through the proximal gradient descent method, which runs faster than the calculation of matrix inverse. Compared with ELM and SVM, SELM obtains better performance with much faster training speed and higher testing accuracy.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICCChina.2018.8641153", "venue": "2018 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)", "journal": "2018 IEEE/CIC International Conference on Communications in China (ICCC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2914966862", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["4349257", "1146461", "15874442", "3264198", "12450925", "2051753", "5117817", "16192658", "18076010", "15037168", "8089649", "3501374", "12490978"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61811264"}

Reliability of Li-ion batteries used in these devices has been recognized as of high importance from a broad range of stakeholders, including medical device manufacturers, regulatory agencies, patients and physicians. To ensure a Li-ion battery operates reliably, it is important to develop health monitoring techniques that accurately estimate the capacity of the battery throughout its life-time. This paper presents a sparse Bayesian learning method that utilizes the charge voltage and current measurements to estimate the capacity of a Li-ion battery used in an implantable medical device. Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) is employed as a probabilistic kernel regression method to learn the complex dependency of the battery capacity on the characteristic features that are extracted from the charge voltage and current measurements. Owing to the sparsity property of RVM, the proposed method generates a reduced-scale regression model that consumes only a small fraction of the CPU time required by a full-scale model, which makes online capacity estimation computationally efficient. 10 years\u2019 continuous cycling data and post-explant cycling data obtained from Li-ion prismatic cells are used to verify the performance of the proposed method.Copyright \u00a9 2015 by ASME", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1115/DETC2015-46964", "venue": "DAC 2015", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2314829130", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["32119642", "49416798", "34472751", "201810974", "198147959", "115527008", "199509126", "8678167", "199510229", "161053603", "56393159", "204939666", "2118545", "19456580"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61766955"}

The Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) scale rating are used to investigate the occurrence and impact of seafarers' emotions on their performance using a bridge simulator. The study was conducted and described in two sections: emotion calibration and test recognition. In the first section, two types of emotions are induced by the sound clips of the International Affective Digitized Sounds (IADS), developed by the National Institute of Mental Health Center for the Study of Human Emotions. In the second section, emotion is recognized by the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, as well as self-rated after the crew-qualified test in a bridge simulator. The results indicate that SVM can identify the emotions by EEG feature extraction, with an accuracy of 77.55%.

To overcome this challenge, many machine learning techniques has been successfully implemented for short/long term forecasting of the PV power. Among all the methods, Extreme learning machine (ELM) is one among the few victorious methodologies\u2019 in machine learning approaches. One of the key potencies, of ELM, for which it is appreciated, is low computational effort required for training recent data because the hidden and output layer nodes are arbitrarily selected and rationally decided.

Thus in this work we have investigated the pruned-ELM (P-ELM) approach as a methodical and programmed approach for developing a forecasting model to predict PV power generation on short term horizon.

First we address the problem of e selection, which we found to be somewhat problematic in our earlier work (e is a parameter with significant influence on noise insensitivity and generalization of SVRs). In particular, rather than employ the standard trial and error based approach, we used an improved tube shrinking method to find e.

Notwithstanding, almost all existing classifiers to date were mostly developed for the closed-set scenario, i.e., the classification setup in which it is assumed that all test samples belong to one of the classes with which the classifier was trained. In the open-set scenario, however, a test sample can belong to none of the known classes and the classifier must properly reject it by classifying it as unknown.

The SVM training is expensive and its cost is dominated by: (i) the kernel value computation, and (ii) a search operation which finds extreme training data points for adjusting the regression function in every training iteration. Existing training algorithms for SVM regression are not scalable to large datasets because: (i) each training iteration repeatedly performs expensive kernel value computations, which is inefficient and requires holding the whole training dataset in memory; (ii) the search operation used in each training iteration considers the whole search space which is very expensive. In this article, we significantly improve the scalability and efficiency of SVM regression by exploiting the high performance of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and solid state drives (SSDs). Our key ideas are as follows. (i) To reduce the cost of repeated kernel value computations and avoid holding the whole training dataset in the GPU memory, we precompute all the kernel values and store them in the CPU memory extended by the SSD; together with an efficient strategy to read the precomputed kernel values, reusing precomputed kernel values with an efficient retrieval is much faster than computing them on-the-fly. This also alleviates the restriction that the training dataset has to fit into the GPU memory, and hence makes our algorithm scalable to large datasets, especially for large datasets with very high dimensionality. (ii) To enhance the performance of the frequently used search operation, we design an algorithm that minimizes the search space and the number of accesses to the GPU global memory; this optimized search algorithm also avoids branch divergence (one of the causes for poor performance) among GPU threads to achieve high utilization of the GPU resources. Our proposed techniques together form a scalable solution to the SVM regression which we call SIGMA. Our extensive experimental results show that SIGMA is highly efficient and can handle very large datasets which the state-of-the-art GPU-based algorithm cannot handle. On the datasets of size that the state-of-the-art GPU-based algorithm can handle, SIGMA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art GPU-based algorithm by an order of magnitude and achieves up to 86 times speedup.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11280-017-0445-1", "venue": "World Wide Web", "journal": "World Wide Web", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2605514503", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14168648", "5485948", "16066300", "2127615", "961425", "1138773", "12683197", "207169888", "16616022", "5155714", "15013488", "17651889", "12324268", "1889567", "58259115", "5667586", "58153557", "8645725", "53306004", "1745892", "12987232", "74754", "10670253", "13886262", "202601846", "2669812", "16079856"], "inbound_citations": ["202676196", "52166809", "199509152", "53084189"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:27156155"}

To cope with this challenge, Self-Organizing Networks (SONs) that were originally designed for legacy networks with reactive approach needs to be transformed to proactive paradigm. This radical transformation is possible only if the future network state can be predicted beforehand by harnessing historical network data. Mobility prediction is one of the key enablers of Proactive SON which enables efficient resource management.

This is limiting progress in the understanding of fundamental biogeochemical processes, such as the global carbon (C) cycle and climate feedback effects on C fluxes. In this study, we evaluated the capabilities of two new satellite datasets that enable regional scale mapping of peatland extent at high spatial resolution, including Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and the Arctic digital elevation model (ArcticDEM). Terrain indices and temporal features derived from these datasets provided input to Random Forest models for delineating four main land cover classes (forest, open upland, water and peatland) in an area in northern Sweden consisting of both lowland and mountainous terrain. The contribution of ArcticDEM to the classification accuracy was assessed by comparing the results with those derived when a high quality LiDAR based DEM (LiDEM) was used as alternative model input. This study shows that multi-seasonal SAR alone can produce reasonable classification results in terms of overall accuracy (OA; 81.6%), but also that it has limitations. The inclusion of terrain indices improved classification performance substantially. OA increased to 87.5% and 90.9% when terrain indices derived from ArcticDEM and LiDEM were included, respectively. The largest increase in accuracy was achieved for the peatland class, which suggests that terrain indices do have the ability to capture the features in the geographic context that aid the discrimination of peatland from other land cover classes. The relatively small difference in classification accuracy between LiDEM and ArcticDEM is encouraging since the latter provides circumpolar coverage. Thus, the combination of Sentinel-1 time series and terrain indices derived from ArcticDEM presents opportunities for substantially improving regional estimates of peatland extent at high latitudes.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2019.111252", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "mag_id": "2951027871", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:197563144"}

Nevertheless, in most cases where the graphs are not given, they are empirically constructed manually, which tends to be sub-optimal. Hence, we propose Graph Learning Neural Networks (GLNN), which exploits the optimization of graphs (the adjacency matrix in particular) and integrates into the GCN for semi-supervised node classification. Leveraging on spectral graph theory, this essentially combines both graph learning and graph convolution into a unified framework. Specifically, we represent features of social/citation networks as graph signals, and propose the objective of graph learning from the graph-signal prior, sparsity constraint and properties of a valid adjacency matrix via maximum a posteriori estimation. The optimization objective is then integrated into the loss function of the GCN, leading to joint learning of the adjacency matrix and high-level features.

This assessment is typically achieved via visual inspection of the surface EMG data. This approach is time-consuming and leads to accurate results only when the assessment is carried out by an EMG expert. A set of algorithms was developed to automatically evaluate aberrant patterns of muscle activity. EMG recordings collected during the performance of functional evaluations in 62 subjects (22 to 61 years old) were used to develop and characterize the algorithms. Clinical scores were generated via visual inspection by an EMG expert using an ordinal scale capturing the severity of aberrant patterns of muscle activity. The algorithms were used in a case study (i.e. the evaluation of a subject with persistent back pain following instrumented lumbar fusion who underwent lumbar hardware removal) to assess the clinical suitability of the proposed technique. The EMG-based algorithms produced accurate estimates of the clinical scores. Results were primarily obtained using a linear regression approach. However, when the results were not satisfactory, a regression implementation of a Random Forest was utilized, and the results compared with those obtained using a linear regression approach. The root-mean-square error of the clinical score estimates produced by the algorithms was a small fraction of the ordinal scale used to rate the severity of the aberrant patterns of muscle activity. Regression coefficients and associated 95% confidence intervals showed that the EMG-based estimates fit well the clinical scores generated by the EMG expert. When applied to the clinical case study, the algorithms appeared to capture the characteristics of the muscle activity patterns associated with persistent back pain following instrumented lumbar fusion. The proposed approach relies on EMG-based measures to generate accurate estimates of the severity of aberrant patterns of muscle activity.

Indeed, both short-term and long-term demands reveal different patterns of passengers in uncertain situations. In pursuit of our goal, we estimated the similarity in stations by both selected and latent features where pre-trained knowledge are combined as an ensemble with different weights. We present Surge Prediction and Knowledge Transfer (SPKT) model that uses Seq2Seq method combined with Multi-source Transfer Learning method on travel patterns extracted from smart card data to classify source stations and target station. To illustrate the demands blueprint, we considered multiple source stations as input to the predictor, to develop a mechanism that bridges the knowledge transfer learning with the targeted stations.

To discriminate between these two conditions, features from the 64-channel EEG recordings were extracted using the power spectrum obtained by a Fast Fourier Transform. Features vectors were selected on an individual basis by using the statistical R2 approach.

In newly diagnosed patients with MM, the combination results in overall response rates of over 70% of patients. However, a considerable number of patients do not respond and will need to proceed to other therapies. The ability to identify patients who are unlikely to respond to particular therapies will allow tailoring of therapeutic approaches and in turn will reduce unnecessary toxicity and morbidity from lack of rapid disease control. With the availability of new technology such as gene expression profiling (GEP), this has become a possibility. We employed this approach to identify genes that can reliably predict lack of response to the thalidomide dexamethasone combination. Methods: Patient samples from the Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group clinical trial (E1A00), that compared thalidomide-dexamethasone combination with dexamethasone, and patient samples from the phase II Mayo Clinic study of thalidomide and dexamethasone, both for newly diagnosed MM, were used for this study. Thirty newly diagnosed patients who were evaluable for response were included in the analysis. GEP was performed using the Affymetrix U133A microarray platform as per manufacturer\u2019s recommendation. The Affymetrix output (CEL files) was imported into Genespring 7.2 (Agilent Technologies) microarray analysis software, normalized across chips using GCRMA followed by per gene normalization to median. For the purposes of this study, responses were defined as reduction in the serum paraprotein (or the urinary M protein in the absence of a serum M protein) of >=50% (PR), 25 to 49% (MR), increase of >=50% (PD) and stable disease for the remaining. Results: Five of the 30 patients had no response to the thalidomide Dexamethasone therapy. Using the class prediction tool available in Genespring (Support Vector Machines), we identified 25 genes that reliable predicted non responders (PD, NC) from the responders (MR, PR, and CR). See table for a list of predictive genes with identified genes. Conclusion: Using a combination of two datasets we have identified a set of genes that can be used to reliably predict lack of response to thalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with newly diagnosed MM.

Firstly, super-pixel block is obtained by SLIC algorithm, significant point is detected by Harris algorithm, and fuzzy salient region contour is extracted by employing convex hull method. Secondly, the four-dimensional texture features of super-pixel blocks in salient regions and background areas are extracted, and then the classification map is obtained by classifying the super-pixel blocks with the help of SVM classifier. Lastly, the morphological and algebraic operations are implemented for repairing classified super-pixel blocks. As a result, one accurate saliency map of tea plant leaf disease image is obtained. Through testing based on 261 diseased images, the quality evaluation index, the accuracy, precision, recall and F-value are 98.5%, 96.8%, 98.6% and 97.7%, respectively. It demonstrates that the proposed method performs better than the other three SLIC-based algorithms in visual effects and quality assessment index. Such conclusion can be drawn that the proposed method can effectively extract tea plant leaf disease saliency map from complex background. Consequently, this research is expected to lay a good basis for the study of tea plant leaf disease identification.

Currently, the damage states are identified either based on visual inspection or pre-determined fragility curves.

This paper proposes a methodology for the rapid damage state assessment (green, yellow, or red) of bridges utilizing the capabilities of machine learning techniques. Contrary to the existing methods, the proposed methodology accounts for bridge-specific attributes in the damage state assessment. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using two-span box-girder bridges in California. The prediction model is established using the training set, and the performance of the model is evaluated using the test set. It is noted that the machine learning algorithm called Random Forest provides better performance for the selected bridges, and its tagging accuracy ranges from 73% to 82% depending on the bridge configuration under consideration.

The auto-encoding variational Bayes method (VAEs) was proposed in 2013, which uses variational inference to learn a latent space from the image database and then generates images using the decoder. The generative adversarial networks (GANs) came out as a promising framework, which uses adversarial training to improve the generative ability of the generator. However, the generated pictures by GANs are generally blurry. The deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs) were then proposed to leverage the quality of generated images. Since the input noise vectors are randomly sampled from a Gaussian distribution, the generator has to map from a whole normal distribution to the images. This makes DCGANs unable to reflect the inherent structure of the training data. In this paper, we propose a novel deep model, called generative adversarial networks with decoder-encoder output noise (DE-GANs), which takes advantage of both the adversarial training and the variational Bayesain inference to improve the performance of image generation. DE-GANs use a pre-trained decoder-encoder architecture to map the random Gaussian noise vectors to informative ones and pass them to the generator of the adversarial networks. Since the decoder-encoder architecture is trained by the same images as the generators, the output vectors could carry the intrinsic distribution information of the original images. Moreover, the loss function of DE-GANs is different from GANs and DCGANs. A hidden-space loss function is added to the adversarial loss function to enhance the robustness of the model. Extensive empirical results show that DE-GANs can accelerate the convergence of the adversarial training process and improve the quality of the generated images.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1807.03923", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2814977632", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["13943041", "393948", "21242497", "1282515", "44761686", "8152666", "15960930", "33937340", "122217809", "54970", "15589934", "1033682", "1930231", "24527328", "940100", "13058841", "8803949", "5808102", "18268744", "195908774", "120349231", "8785311", "60282629", "14865278", "459456", "22852474", "5092785", "12640199", "605416", "2475577", "11758569", "1355449", "14888175", "14989939", "38576666", "51612859", "879235", "1045818", "3960646", "9893011"], "inbound_citations": ["166227843", "61806147"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49665341"}

Accordingly, a novel GPGPU performance estimation model with both core and memory frequency scaling is herein proposed. We design a cross-benchmarking suite, which simulates kernels with a wide range of instruction distributions.

In this work we describe a probabilistic framework that allows for the output of multiple information extraction systems to be combined in a systematic way. The identified entities are assigned a probability score that reflects the extractors' confidence, without the need for each individual extractor to generate a probability score. We quantitively compared the performance of multiple chemical tokenizers to measure the effect of tokenization on extraction accuracy. Later, a single Conditional Random Fields (CRF) extractor that utilizes the best performing tokenizer is built using a unique collection of features such as word embeddings and Soundex codes, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been explored in this context before,ResultsThe ensemble of multiple extractors outperforms each extractor's individual performance during the CHEMDNER challenge. When the runs were optimized to favor recall, the ensemble approach achieved the second highest recall on unseen entities. As for the single CRF model with novel features, the extractor achieves an F1 score of 83.3% on the test set, without any post processing or abbreviation matching.ConclusionsEnsemble information extraction is effective when multiple stand alone extractors are to be used, and produces higher performance than individual off the shelf extractors.

These vegetation types were empirically defined according to their composition, strata and biodiversity richness. On one hand, it is assumed that the same vegetation type spectral signatures have similarities. Consequently, they can be compared to a reference spectral database. To catch those similarities, several similarities criteria (related to distances (Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Canberra distance) or spectral shapes (Spectral Angle Mapper) or probabilistic behaviour (Spectral Information Divergence)) and several mathematical transformations of spectral signatures enhancing absorption features (such as the first derivative or the second derivative, the normalized spectral signature, the continuum removal, the continuum removal derivative reflectance, the log transformation) were investigated. Furthermore, those similarity measures were applied on spectral ranges which characterize specific biophysical properties. On the other hand, we suppose that specific biophysical properties/components may help to discriminate between vegetation types applying supervised classification such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Regularized Logistic Regression (RLR), Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA). Biophysical components can be used in a local way considering vegetation spectral indices or in a global way considering spectral ranges and transformed spectral signatures, as explained above. RLR classifier applied on spectral vegetation indices (training size = 25%) was able to achieve 77.21% overall accuracy in discriminating peatland vegetation types.

An increasing interest has been focused on modeling techniques like Bayesian Networks since their capability of (1) combining in the probabilistic framework different type of evidence including both expert judgments and objective data; (2) overturning previous beliefs in the light of the new information being received and (3) making predictions even with incomplete data. In this work, we proposed a comparison among Bayesian Networks and other classical Quantitative Risk Assessment techniques such as Neural Networks, Classification Trees, Random Forests and Logistic Regression models. Hybrid approaches, combining both Classification Trees and Bayesian Networks, were also considered. Among Bayesian Networks, a clear distinction between purely data-driven approach and combination of expert knowledge with objective data is made. The aim of this paper consists in evaluating among this models which best can be applied, in the framework of Quantitative Risk Assessment, to assess the safety of children who are exposed to the risk of inhalation/insertion/aspiration of consumer products. The issue of preventing injuries in children is of paramount importance, in particular where product design is involved: quantifying the risk associated to product characteristics can be of great usefulness in addressing the product safety design regulation.

In this paper, we present a method of precomputing optimized trajectories and compressing the information to get a compact representation of the optimal policy function. By varying the initial configuration of a robot and optimizing multiple trajectories, the controller gains knowledge about the optimal policy function. Such computation can be performed on a powerful workstation or even supercomputers instead of an onboard computer of the robot. The precomputed optimal trajectories are stored in a Single-hidden Layer Feedforward neural Network (SLFN) using Optimally Pruned Extreme Learning Machine (OP-ELM). This ensures minimal representation of the model and fast evaluation of the SLFN. We first explain our method using a simple time-optimal control problem with an analytical solution.

GANs are on the frontier as further extension of deep learning into many domains (e.g., medicine, robotics, content synthesis) requires massive sets of labeled data that is generally either unavailable or prohibitively costly to collect. Although GANs are gaining prominence in various fields, there are no accelerators for these new models. In fact, GANs leverage a new operator, called transposed convolution, that exposes unique challenges for hardware acceleration. This operator first inserts zeros within the multidimensional input, then convolves a kernel over this expanded array to add information to the embedded zeros. Even though there is a convolution stage in this operator, the inserted zeros lead to underutilization of the compute resources when a conventional convolution accelerator is employed. We propose the GANAX architecture to alleviate the sources of inefficiency associated with the acceleration of GANs using conventional convolution accelerators, making the first GAN accelerator design possible. We propose a reorganization of the output computations to allocate compute rows with similar patterns of zeros to adjacent processing engines, which also avoids inconsequential multiply-adds on the zeros. This compulsory adjacency reclaims data reuse across these neighboring processing engines, which had otherwise diminished due to the inserted zeros. The reordering breaks the full SIMD execution model, which is prominent in convolution accelerators. Therefore, we propose a unified MIMD-SIMD design for GANAX that leverages repeated patterns in the computation to create distinct microprograms that execute concurrently in SIMD mode.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1806.01107", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ISCA.2018.00060", "venue": "2018 ACM/IEEE 45th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)", "journal": "2018 ACM/IEEE 45th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2950954069,2963577671,2806666179", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16628328", "3672198", "16153365", "1499857", "10804187", "8239952", "3248075", "11758569", "4202768", "1663491", "67444704", "525898", "207209696", "21681898", "207882941", "1775161", "5793764", "5262122", "319103", "15281419", "206464266", "6016019", "52824162", "195350131", "5416603", "2134321", "26726314", "11504619", "207220904", "13256843", "10175867", "1744178", "45031577", "2050688", "14512131", "61652386", "851574", "1312967", "6074727", "12911488", "52807439", "19257811", "14441598", "39195226", "9611113", "9700159", "25406634", "7086104", "34353864", "61204521", "21951617", "5897017", "12662941", "12845977"], "inbound_citations": ["202700221", "21681898", "201701769", "208883774", "204728876", "208139007", "214784338", "203610558", "53114435", "195799091", "214692068", "198895402", "89617717", "57764551", "51977420", "102346098", "56177273", "210695728", "189818910", "209496589", "209515444", "214586807", "57721133", "71146205", "53235059", "57189467", "163164841", "214692219", "195750708"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21656909"}

The AdaSWI subalgorithm initializes the samples\u2019 weights adaptively based on the generated base models\u2019 prediction errors, and fine-tunes the samples\u2019 weights based on the distances from the samples to the clustering centers of base models\u2019 training datasets, achieving more appropriate samples weights initialization. While the AdaWPA algorithm adaptively adjusts base predictors\u2019 weights based on prediction instances and integrates the base predictors employing these adjusted weights. Besides, the AdaWPA subalgorithm makes use of Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm for distance measurement, further reducing computational complexity and storage space of the algorithm.

Environmental variables are often used as indirect surrogates for mapping biodiversity because species survey data are scant at regional scales, especially in the marine realm. However, environmental variables are measured on arbitrary scales unlikely to have simple, direct relationships with biological patterns. Instead, biodiversity may respond nonlinearly and to interactions between environmental variables.2. To investigate the role of the environment in driving patterns of biodiversity composition in large marine regions, we collated multiple biological survey and environmental data sets from tropical NE Australia, the deep Gulf of Mexico and the temperate Gulf of Maine. We then quantified the shape and magnitude of multispecies responses along >30 environmental gradients and the extent to which these variables predicted regional distributions. To do this, we applied a new statistical approach, Gradient Forest, an extension of Random Forest, capable of modelling nonlinear and threshold responses.3. The regional-scale environmental variables predicted an average of 13-35% (up to 50-85% for individual species) of the variation in species abundance distributions. Important predictors differed among regions and biota and included depth, salinity, temperature, sediment composition and current stress. The shapes of responses along gradients also differed and were nonlinear, often with thresholds indicative of step changes in composition. These differing regional responses were partly due to differing environmental indicators of bioregional boundaries and, given the results to date, may indicate limited scope for extrapolating bio-physical relationships beyond the region of source data sets.4.Synthesis and applications. Gradient Forest offers a new capability for exploring relationships between biodiversity and environmental gradients, generating new information on multispecies responses at a detail not available previously. Importantly, given the scarcity of data, Gradient Forest enables the combined use of information from disparate data sets. The gradient response curves provide biologically informed transformations of environmental layers to predict and map expected patterns of biodiversity composition that represent sampled composition better than uninformed variables. The approach can be applied to support marine spatial planning and management and has similar applicability in terrestrial realms.Gradient Forest offers a new capability for exploring relationships between biodiversity and environmental gradients, generating new information on multispecies responses at a detail not available previously.

An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a signal that measures the electric activity of the heart. The proposed approach is implemented using ML-libs and Scala language on Apache Spark framework; MLlib is Apache Spark\u2019s scalable machine learning library. The key challenge in ECG classification is to handle the irregularities in the ECG signals which is very important to detect the patient status. Therefore, we have proposed an efficient approach to classify ECG signals with high accuracy Each heartbeat is a combination of action impulse waveforms produced by different specialized cardiac heart tissues. Heartbeats classification faces some difficulties because these waveforms differ from person to another, they are described by some features. These features are the inputs of machine learning algorithm. In general, using Spark\u2013Scala tools simplifies the usage of many algorithms such as machine-learning (ML) algorithms. On other hand, Spark\u2013Scala is preferred to be used more than other tools when size of processing data is too large. In our case, we have used a dataset with 205,146 records to evaluate the performance of our approach. Machine learning libraries in Spark\u2013Scala provide easy ways to implement many classification algorithms (Decision Tree, Random Forests, Gradient-Boosted Trees (GDB), etc.). The proposed method is evaluated and validated on baseline MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and MIT-BIH Supraventricular Arrhythmia database. The results show that our approach achieved an overall accuracy of 96.75% using GDB Tree algorithm and 97.98% using random Forest for binary classification. For multi class classification, it achieved to 98.03% accuracy using Random Forest, Gradient Boosting tree supports only binary classification.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1186/s40537-019-0244-x", "venue": "Journal of Big Data", "journal": "Journal of Big Data", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2970930856", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1686251", "19261901", "7683991", "1800351", "5042483", "23271977", "49648537", "12128122", "3739780", "30276853", "6811679", "45424035", "31039418", "44049239", "69292897", "16190154", "206420153", "11476140"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201675002"}

The tests were configured with Paired T Tester (corrected) and the level in the test of significance was taken as 0.05. The comparison fields Percent_correct, fmeasure, irrecall, irprecision and auc (area under roc) were taken for evaluation. Tests were also performed for ranking and summary. Findings: As per the results obtained by the Weka Experimenter with the 10 classifiers on the KDD 20% training dataset, it has been analysed that Random forest classifier works best with the comparison fields percent_correct, fmeasure and AUC (Area under ROC). Simplecart classifier ranks next to Randomforest classifier with the comparison fields percent_correct and measure. Simplecart classifier outperforms all other classifiers with respect to the comparison field irprecision. ZeroR is found to be the worst classifier in terms of all the comparison fields other than irrecall. Thus it has been found that with the dataset that is taken for experiment, further detailed study could be restricted only with the five classifiers namely Random Forest, Simple cart, J48, Bagging and IBk.

Therefore, we propose a novel posing-based detection method through measuring muscle deformation, which only requires arbitrary and discrete posture data for calibration without walking. In this study, we firstly collected the posing data as the training set and gait data as the test set from participants through a FirstVR device. Then the Support Vector Machine was trained to be a two-class classifier of heel-contact and non-heel-contact phases by using the collected muscle deformation data during posing. Finally we propose an efficient evaluation system by taking advantage of OpenPose to automatically label our continuous gait data.

When physical disabilities bottleneck the natural modality of performing a task, acquisition of ample training data is difficult which practically obstructs classifier training. Previous works have tackled this problem by generalizing the feature space amongst multiple subjects including the test subject. This work aims at knowledge transfer to classify EEG of the target subject using a classifier trained with the EEG of another unit source subject. A many-objective optimization framework is proposed where optimal weights are obtained for projecting features in another dimension such that single source-trained target EEG classification performance is maximized with the modified features. To validate the approach, motor imagery tasks from the BCI Competition III Dataset IVa are classified using power spectral density based features and linear support vector machine. Several performance metrics, improvement in accuracy, sensitivity to the dimension of the projected space, assess the efficacy of the proposed approach.

Four subjects performed the experiment, which consisted of two separate phases: the training and testing phase. Extreme Learning Machine algorithm is used to classify the myoelectric signals to the control motions. The data collected during the training phase is used to train the parameters of the decoder, and the data from the testing phase is used to quantify the performance of the decoder.

Some recent articles have proposed methods for optimizing classifiers by choosing classifier parameter values that minimize the CV error estimate. We have evaluated the validity of using the CV error estimate of the optimized classifier as an estimate of the true error expected on independent data.ResultsWe used CV to optimize the classification parameters for two kinds of classifiers; Shrunken Centroids and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Random training datasets were created, with no difference in the distribution of the features between the two classes. Using these \"null\" datasets, we selected classifier parameter values that minimized the CV error estimate. 10-fold CV was used for Shrunken Centroids while Leave-One-Out-CV (LOOCV) was used for the SVM. Independent test data was created to estimate the true error. With \"null\" and \"non null\" (with differential expression between the classes) data, we also tested a nested CV procedure, where an inner CV loop is used to perform the tuning of the parameters while an outer CV is used to compute an estimate of the error.The CV error estimate for the classifier with the optimal parameters was found to be a substantially biased estimate of the true error that the classifier would incur on independent data. Even though there is no real difference between the two classes for the \"null\" datasets, the CV error estimate for the Shrunken Centroid with the optimal parameters was less than 30% on 18.5% of simulated training data-sets. For SVM with optimal parameters the estimated error rate was less than 30% on 38% of \"null\" data-sets. Performance of the optimized classifiers on the independent test set was no better than chance.The nested CV procedure reduces the bias considerably and gives an estimate of the error that is very close to that obtained on the independent testing set for both Shrunken Centroids and SVM classifiers for \"null\" and \"non-null\" data distributions.ConclusionWe show that using CV to compute an error estimate for a classifier that has itself been tuned using CV gives a significantly biased estimate of the true error. Proper use of CV for estimating true error of a classifier developed using a well defined algorithm requires that all steps of the algorithm, including classifier parameter tuning, be repeated in each CV loop.

An example is land-cover maps, which are useful for monitoring both human-and naturally induced environmental changes to enhance environmental management for the benefit of the society. Yet there are numerous critical areas of the world such as biodiversity hotspots where the inaccessibility of quality satellite images has hindered progress in our understanding and management of the natural environment. The West African biodiversity hotspot is one such area where persistent thick clouds in freely available satellite images has been a great discouragement to the production of local land-cover maps to monitor the ongoing deforestation and rapid environmental change. Ghana is a country in West Africa where no land-cover map except global ones has been published for over a decade although large tracts of land have been converted from their natural states to agricultural land. In this article, we present 30 m land-cover maps of the country using Landsat 8 images and three popular classifiers \u2013 Maximum Likelihood Classifier MLC, Support Vector Machines SVMs, and random forest RF \u2013 for the year 2015. We produced these maps for use in our future biodiversity assessment in the region. An overall accuracy OA of 85.5% kappa = 0.77 was achieved for MLC, with similar but slightly lower accuracies for RF and SVM, which indicates that advanced classification algorithms may not have many advantages when applied to process only multispectral optical data. We observe that shrublands, croplands, and orchards are the dominant classes occupying 35.6%, 31.9%, and 18.4% of the country\u2019s land area, respectively. This further indicates that 50.0% of the country\u2019s land area is under agriculture. Thick forests occupy only 8.0% of the land and are almost entirely confined to forest reserves, highlighting the usefulness of these nature reserves.

Rewarming these lungs on EVLP from 4\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C normalizes metabolic activity, and studying the dynamic metabolomic profile may help us understand lung injury and predict the ultimate function of the transplanted lung. Metabolic profiling of EVLP perfusate may elucidate the metabolic changes of donor lungs on EVLP. Methods and Materials Donor lungs from 28 BDD and 22 DCD donors were assessed on EVLP for 4 hours prior to LTx. For each lung, EVLP perfusate was sampled at 1 hr and 4 hr perfusion, and global metabolomic profiling was performed with Mass Spectrometry. We examined the results over time and with respect to BDD vs. DCD status. Results Global metabolomics detected 312 metabolites. Statistical analysis with Random Forest (RF) classification showed a dramatic difference in metabolite profiles between EVLP 1hr and 4hr with a 96% accuracy in predicting whether a sample was taken at the start or end of EVLP perfusion. Interestingly, the metabolic profiles grouped by donor status were sufficiently different to be able to predict with RF whether a sample belongs to BDD or DCD donor, with an accuracy of 80% at 1hr and 78% at 4 hr EVLP. Conclusions As we search for opportunities to personalize the diagnosis and treatment of the donor lung, it is evident that EVLP perfusate is easily accessible and is imminently suitable for metabolomics. The changes in metabolites in donor lungs as EVLP progresses confirms that cellular metabolism is active and modified over time in normothermic EVLP. The metabolomic profile demonstrates significant differences between BDD and DCD donor lungs during EVLP as well as dynamic changes over time.

{"paper_id": "192648971", "title": "Modeling human behaviour to improve retail efficiency and health monitoring", "authors": [{"first": "Marcos", "middle": [], "last": "Quintana Gonz\u00e1lez", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "This dissertation presents a model to express the most relevant features of the human behaviour, specifying two personalized instances for retail and health Monitoring domains. These features are divided into static and dynamic. For the static ones facial features are the most relevant since they can express different attributes of the subjects such as age, gender, emotions ... For that purpose landmarks and pose are the most significant points of interest. However, the body pose can also reveal some interesting features of the current state of one person and should also be taken into account. Regarding the dynamic properties, the trajectories described by a subject in the monitored scenario can also express very useful insights. It is a basic task to delimit the area where the subject is located that is mandatory to perform the static inferences. The interactions of the user with the environment are a very relevant feature, and should be modeled as well. Thus, initial model has been evolved for the domains previously mentioned. Retail is a scenario where the shoppers express a large amount of features that should be considered by the retailers. Concepts such as density of the areas of the establishment, focus of attention, interactions with the shelves, queues management or characterization of the visitors are included in the model to improve the efficiency of the physical shops. A completely different field such as health monitoring could lead to a completely different approach. But the trajectories of the patients, their facial properties, their interactions or their body pose are also meaningful in this domain to assist decision-making of the health professionals. In our work we have mainly studied the behaviour of the patients with cognitive diseases. This field requires monitoring in different scenarios such as the home of the patient, the clinic centre or the rehabilitation centre. A scalabe system and its deployment is proposed to provide an accurate monitoring. In this area we shall also include medical features such as the treatment of the patients, their body pose evolution in physiotherapy sessions or measurements such as their body temperature or their heart rate. Stated the architecture of every domain, we have gone beyond in two Computer Vision and Machine Learning tasks: human pedestrian tracking and facial analysis. For the first we have developed two solutions that have been tested on real scenarios and on controlled environments that are suitable for a deeper analysis. Feature descriptors such as HOG or LBP have been tested, and Machine Learning classifiers such as Adaboost or Support Vector Machines have been optimized. We propose the best combination for previously exposed techniques and we show results on the different scenarios proposed to validate our proposal. A 3D visual imaging system is optimized by the proposal of a multi-camera RGB-D system able to capture facial properties at extreme poses. The data collection gathered allow 3D reconstruction of facial areas of 92 subjects captured, and a complete 3D reconstruction pipeline is proposed. Deep learning methods require a large amount of annotated data such as the output of our proposed system. We rely on that insight to perform an innovative data augmentation method for facial landmark detection that has been tested and discussed on two state of the art deep networks for this task.

As the widely existing cases, the phenomenon of baseline drift is generated by the fluctuation of laser energy, inhomogeneity of sample surfaces and the background noise, which has aroused the interest of many researchers. Most of the prevalent algorithms usually need to preset some key parameters, such as the suitable spline function and the fitting order, thus do not have adaptability. Based on the characteristics of LIBS, such as the sparsity of spectral peaks and the low-pass filtered feature of baseline, a novel baseline correction and spectral data denoising method is studied in this paper. The improved technology utilizes convex optimization scheme to form a non-parametric baseline correction model. Meanwhile, asymmetric punish function is conducted to enhance signal-noise ratio (SNR) of the LIBS signal and improve reconstruction precision. Furthermore, an efficient iterative algorithm is applied to the optimization process, so as to ensure the convergence of this algorithm. To validate the proposed method, the concentration analysis of Chromium (Cr),Manganese (Mn) and Nickel (Ni) contained in 23 certified high alloy steel samples is assessed by using quantitative models with Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

We propose to sample the landmarks from determinantal distributions on non-Euclidean spaces. Since current determinantal sampling algorithms have the same complexity as those for manifold learning, we present an efficient approximation with linear complexity. Further, we recover the local geometry after the sparsification by assigning each landmark a local covariance matrix, estimated from the original point set.

As a case study , we describe a novel transformation from clausal form Conjunctive Normal Form Satisfaction problem ( CNF-SAT ) to an integer linear programming model. The resulting matrix has a regular structure and is no longer problem-specific. It depends just on the number of clauses and the number of variables, but not on the structure of the clauses. The structure of the integer program allows to solve it by means of standard linear programming techniques. Then we describe several connectionist network paradigms to solve the second optimization problem. Some of these networks are effective in solving this problem as shown in significant tests. The connectionist approach is compared with a standard Linear Programming (LP) procedure, and with a more recent hybrid LP technique.

However, the real world is different from a single scenario dataset, filled with countless scenarios that are not covered by the dataset, namely, out-of-domain. As a result, parsers that perform well on the in-domain data often suffer significant performance degradation on the out-of-domain data. Therefore, in order to adapt the existing in-domain parsers with substantial performance to the new domain scenario, cross-domain transfer learning techniques are essential to solve the domain problem in parsing. In this paper, we examine two scenarios for cross-domain transfer learning: semi-supervised and unsupervised cross-domain transfer learning. Specifically, we adopt a pretrained language model BERT for training on the source domain (in-domain) data at subword level and introduce two tri-training variant methods for the two scenarios so as to achieve the goal of cross-domain transfer learning.

The model demonstrates that a simple plan- ning schema, acting in concert with two general purpose cognitive functionalities, namely, episodic memory and perception, can solve a restricted class of planning prob- lems by backchaining from the goal to the current state. In spite of its simple structure, the schema can search for and execute plans involving multiple steps. We discuss how this simple model can be extended into a more pow- erful and expressive planning system by incorporating ad- ditional control and memory structures. Introduction Consider a classical planning problem, specified by an initial state, a goal state and a set of operators. A direct approach to solving this problem consists of searching the state space to find a \u2018path\u2019 between the initial and fi- nal states. Several symbolic planning systems adopting this approach in conjunction with the use of heuristics (Hoffman & Nebel, 2001; Haslum & Geffner, 2000; Bac- chus & Teh, 1998) have recently shown notable improve- ments in efficiency on various benchmark problems. Although a state space search algorithm is conceptu- ally simple, it is not obvious how the data structures and control mechanisms required for the specification and execution of such an algorithm can be realized in a neu- rally plausible manner. In this paper we propose a con- nectionist model that exhibits a state-space search behav- ior. The model uses only a few simple control structures in conjunction with essential cognitive faculties, such as episodic memory, semantic memory, and perception. Episodic memory (Tulving, 1995) refers to our abil- ity to remember specific events and situations in our daily lives. The use of memory and experience in plan- ning and reasoning has been investigated by several re- searchers (see (Waltz, 1995; Spalazzi, 2001) for useful accounts). Neurological and psychological data strongly suggests that episodic memory is distinct both in its functional characteristics and neural basis from other forms of memories such as semantic memory, memory for common sense knowledge, and procedural knowl- edge. It has been argued that events and situations in episodic memory are best viewed as relational instances that specify a set of bindings between the roles of a rela- tional schema and objects that fill these roles in a given event or situation (Shastri, 2001b; 2002). We assume that a planning agent is capable of remembering past events such as \u201cperforming action under conditions lead to consequences \u201d. Each episodic memory trace of this type can be represented as a triple of the form Precon- ditions, Action, Consequences, and we will refer to such triples as PAC memories (or events) 1 . Finally, we assume that the planning agent is capable of observing the current world state through perception. By this we mean that the agent can determine whether or not certain perceptually salient and directly observable relations hold in the world. For example, in the context of the classical blocks world scenario, this assumes that the agent can look at the table and determine whether or not a specific block is \u2018clear.\u2019 A memory-based planning schema Figure 1 shows the abstract structure of the proposed planning schema. In order to explain its behavior, let us describe the functionality of each of its components and their interactions using a simple example. Episodic Memory Observable World state R ECALL subgoal i+1 fail subgoal C OMPARE subgoal i+1 match? i C URRENT G OAL Goal Success/Failure Figure 1: A block diagram showing the basic compo- nents of the planning mechanism. Consider a planning problem with only two blocks (\u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019) where the agent\u2019s goal is to achieve On(A,B) (i.e. block A on block B) and the current world state is On(B,A). Let us assume that the agent\u2019s episodic memory contains the two PAC events E and E : Note that preconditions and consequences may contain multiple predicates.", "year": 2002, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4324/9781315782379-96", "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1539113493", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10002580", "196186", "6552475", "14799428", "15582935", "12602726", "16444135", "16527058", "9530143", "141279830", "1952366", "9559474"], "inbound_citations": ["420696", "2375017", "10879569"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10742430"}

For this purpose, 12 parameters of monthly climate data were collected and used as input parameters to the models. The parameters were subjected to quality assurance tests to ensure their validity and acceptability. The study was conducted in three sections: (i) Sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the dominant inputs. (ii) Single models were trained and their performances were accessed on the basis of ET 0 derived from pan evaporation method. (iii) Finally, three ensemble methods of simple averaging, weighted averaging and neural ensemble were applied in strategy 1 (for AI models) and strategy 2 (for empirical models) to improve the predicting performance. The results revealed that depending on the climate of the regions, pan evaporation, solar radiation, temperatures and surface pressure are the most dominant parameters, empirical and MLR models could be employed to achieve the valuable results, AI based models are superior in performance to the other models, also promising improvement in ET 0 modeling could be achieved by ensemble modeling.

The research that was conducted on these three topics and the resulting innovations are presented. The performance of the individual modules, as well as the complete system, is thoroughly investigated. The focus of this theses are German news.

A speech recogniser transforms the audio signals into texts, which are afterwards classified for the presence of pre-defined topics. For topic classification, approaches with Hidden Markov Models, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are investigated. One contribution of this thesis is the introduction of novel couplers for SVMs with advantages over known couplers.

Its diagnosis requires accurate biomarkers that are sensitive to disease stages. In this respect, we regard probabilistic classification as a method of designing a probabilistic biomarker for disease staging. Probabilistic biomarkers naturally support the interpretation of decisions and evaluation of uncertainty associated with them. In this paper, we obtain probabilistic biomarkers via Gaussian Processes. Gaussian Processes enable probabilistic kernel machines that offer flexible means to accomplish Multiple Kernel Learning. Exploiting this flexibility, we propose a new variation of Automatic Relevance Determination and tackle the challenges of high dimensionality through multiple kernels. Our research results demonstrate that the Gaussian Process models are competitive with or better than the well-known Support Vector Machine in terms of classification performance even in the cases of single kernel learning. Extending the basic scheme towards the Multiple Kernel Learning, we improve the efficacy of the Gaussian Process models and their interpretability in terms of the known anatomical correlates of the disease.

Such huge video collections hold useful yet implicit and nontrivial knowledge about various domains. To manage and utilize these resources effectively, video concept detection becomes a very important subject of intensive research by a large research community (Over et al., 2008). It is an integral part of visual data mining that is automatically extracting such knowledge from the huge unstructured visual data. It aims to automatically annotate video shots or keyframes with respect to a semantic concept (Tang et al., 2012). Ranging from objects like airplane and car to scenes like urban street and sky, semantic concepts serve as good intermediate semantic features for video content indexing and understanding, and thus, spurring much research attention (Jiang et al., 2010; Naphade & Smith, 2004; Snoek et al., 2006; Zheng et al., 2008). Essentially, concept detection is a classification task, in which a binary classifier is usually learned to predict the presence of a certain concept in a video shot or keyframe (image).

Following this trend, in the current paper we discuss and explore a microRNA-target prediction method based on a random forest classifier, namely RFMirTarget. Despite its well-known robustness regarding general classifying tasks, to the best of our knowledge, random forest have not been deeply explored for the specific context of predicting microRNAs targets. Our framework first analyzes alignments between candidate microRNA-target pairs and extracts a set of structural, thermodynamics, alignment, seed and position-based features, upon which classification is performed. Experiments have shown that RFMirTarget outperforms several well-known classifiers with statistical significance, and that its performance is not impaired by the class imbalance problem or features correlation. Moreover, comparing it against other algorithms for microRNA target prediction using independent test data sets from TarBase and starBase, we observe a very promising performance, with higher sensitivity in relation to other methods. Finally, tests performed with RFMirTarget show the benefits of feature selection even for a classifier with embedded feature importance analysis, and the consistency between relevant features identified and important biological properties for effective microRNA-target gene alignment.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3724815", "pubmed_id": "23922946", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0070153", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2093664890", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["34567578", "205020975", "2220862", "36842606", "1891684", "8390020", "11582746", "2932152", "4074916", "8233668", "7050661", "88051061", "2152174", "6442946", "2175155", "22672750", "3169194", "17488410", "2550102", "206341150", "14475273", "8848", "7928351", "1365352", "207738357", "89141", "1836349", "11062391", "12211379", "209092086", "37984154", "34649738", "5267776", "30840571", "7764682", "7161110", "15663780", "205217460", "39579450", "9661746", "1721807", "1933238", "11278818"], "inbound_citations": ["214571547", "9764887", "557546", "10934186", "46159577", "7834363", "215212405", "211265718", "12957818", "51715377", "20303824", "9896097"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4122989"}

In mobile robotics, collision avoidance is critical for the success of the robots in implementing their tasks, especially when the robots work in cluttered and dynamic environments, which include humans. Traditional obstacle avoidance methods deal with the human as dynamic obstacles, without taking into consideration that the human will also try to avoid the robot, and this might cause a collision when both take the same avoidance path. To evade such situations, a supervised collision avoidance system for indoor mobile robots based on 3D vision and human-robot interaction is proposed. In this method, both the robot and the human will collaborate in generating the collision avoidance via interaction. The robot will notify the human about its existence via voice messages. After a certain distance, the robot will ask the human to interact. If a user interacted with the robot, it will execute the collision-avoidance path based on the interaction; else the robot will calculate the collision-free path autonomously. Kinect sensor is used for human detection, and two methods are compared which are Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) for gesture recognition. Furthermore, a robust collision avoidance system is implemented which is fused with the implemented HRI system to avoid collisions with humans. The system is tested on H20 robot (DrRobot Company, Canada) and the experiments proved the strength of the proposed method in interacting with the human and avoiding collisions with them.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "2016 17th International Conference on Mechatronics - Mechatronika (ME)", "journal": "2016 17th International Conference on Mechatronics - Mechatronika (ME)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2583894240", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["3839612", "111254867", "10846589", "7811642", "757244", "26122953", "1718553"], "inbound_citations": ["202701152"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:40926955"}

The irregular and chaotic flow oscillations are often observed in boiling natural circulation systems so it is difficult for operators to monitor and predict the condition of these systems. An online condition forecasting method for natural circulation system is proposed in this study as an assisting technique for plant operators. The proposed prediction approach was developed based on Ensemble of Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (EOS-ELM) and phase space reconstruction. Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) is an online sequential learning neural network algorithm and EOS-ELM is the ensemble method of it. The proposed condition prediction method can be initiated by a small chunk of monitoring data and it can be updated by newly arrived data at very fast speed during the online prediction. Simulation experiments were conducted on the data of two natural circulation loops to validate the performance of the proposed method. The simulation results show that the proposed predication model can successfully recognize different types of flow oscillations and accurately forecast the trend of monitored plant variables. The influence of the number of hidden nodes and neural network inputs on prediction performance was studied and the proposed model can achieve good accuracy in a wide parameter range.

Evaluating the factors which drive SOC dynamics and carbon sequestration potential in reclaimed land is critical for improving soil fertility and mitigating global warming. This study aims to determine the current status and factors important to the SOC density in a typical reclaimed land located in Eastern China, where land reclamation has been undergoing for centuries. A total of 4746 topsoil samples were collected from 2007 to 2010. The SOC density of the reclaimed land (3.18\u00b10.05kgCm(-2); mean\u00b1standard error) is significantly lower than that of the adjacent non-reclaimed land (5.71\u00b10.04kgCm(-2)) (p<0.05). A Random Forest model is developed and it captures the relationships between the SOC density and the environmental/anthropogenic factors (R(2)=0.59). The soil pH, land use, and elevation are the most important factors for determining SOC dynamics. In contrast, the effect of the reclamation age on the SOC density is negligible, where SOC content in the land reclaimed during years 1047-1724 is as low as that reclaimed during years 1945-2004. The scenario analysis results indicate that the carbon sequestration potential of the reclaimed lands may achieve a maximum of 5.80\u00b11.81kgCO2m(-2) (mean\u00b1SD) when dryland is converted to flooded land with vegetable-rice cropping system and soil pH of ~5.9. Note that in some scenarios the methane emission substantially offsets the carbon sequestration potential, especially for continuous rice cropping system.

A recurrent neural network (RNN) in the second stage is fully utilized for learning temporal information between sleep epochs and obtaining classification results. To solve serious sample imbalance problem, a novel pre-training process combined with data augmentation was introduced. The proposed method was evaluated by two public databases, the Sleep-EDF and Sleep Apnea (SA). The proposed method can achieve the F1-score and Kappa coefficient of 0.806 and 0.80 for healthy subjects, respectively, and achieve 0.790 and 0.74 for the subjects with suspect sleep disorders, respectively. The results show that the method can achieve better performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods for the same databases. Model analysis displayed that the combination of the hand-crafted features and network trained features can improve the classification performance via the comparison experiments.

Two important challenges exist. The first challenge lies in the discrepancy between source and target areas (e.g., layouts, road conditions, and local regulations) and such discrepancy would prevent a direct application of a model from the source area to the target area. The second challenge lies in the difficulty of identifying all potential features in the migratable traffic risk estimation problem and decide the importance of identified features due to the lack of ground truth labels in the target area. To address these challenges, we develop DeepRisk, a social sensing based migratable traffic risk estimation scheme using deep transfer learning techniques.

Data mining applied to intrusion detection is an active area of research. The main reason for using data mining techniques for intrusion detection systems is due to the enormous volume of existing and newly appearing network data that require processing. Data mining follows anomaly based intrusion detection. The drawback of the anomaly based intrusion detection in a wireless network is the high rate of false positive. This can be solved by a designing a hybrid intrusion detection system by connecting a misuse detection module to the anomaly detection module. In this paper, we propose to develop a hybrid intrusion detection system for wireless local area networks, based on Fuzzy logic. In this Hybrid Intrusion Detection system, anomaly detection is performed using the Bayesian network technique and misuse detection is performed using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique. The overall decision of system is performed by the fuzzy logic. For anomaly detection using Bayesian network, each node has a monitoring agent and a classifier within it for its detection and a mobile agent for information collection. The anomaly is measured based on the naive Bayesian technique. For misuse detection using SVM, all the data that lie within the hyper plane are considered to be normal whereas the data that lie outside the hyper plane are considered to be intrusive. The outputs of both anomaly detection and misuse detection modules are applied by the fuzzy decision rules to perform the final decision making.

A sensor is a device that measures a physical quantity and transforms it into a digital signal. It provides great amounts of continuous raw measurements that can be difficult to interpret by physicians or nurses. Hence, processing the raw measurements into potential clinical findings and biomarkers (towards the digital phenotyping) is becoming a key issue. In that regard, artificial intelligence techniques play an important role. Nevertheless, the huge amount of existing methods requires skilled people able to identify the suitable knowledge representation to be used, the most appropriate machine learning technique, which in turn depend on the kind of data available, the task to be performed (e.g. diagnosing or treatment), and how the quality of the learned findings will be measured. Objectives We aim to help engineers and researchers in selecting the most appropriate technique. To that end, we analyze different knowledge representation and machine learning methods on data gathered by a wearable sensor. In particular, the raw data is obtained from force sensors installed in a person shoes (sandals), and the data has been gathered when the patient walks. From the data, gait patterns can be obtained to support clinical decisions. In particular, the recovery period of a person which has suffered a hip surgery: adequate (short) or not-adequate (long); therefore, we are dealing with a classification task. Description Knowledge representation methods are analyzed according to two dimensions: abstraction (raw measurements, feature descriptions, and labels) and granularity (high and low). On the other hand, we analyze machine learning methods according to the following dimensions: temporal (whether the methods are able to deal with chronological data or not); modelling facilities (availability of a generated model: eager methods generate an explicit model; lazy methods do not), and modelling complexity (linear versus non-linear). A total of 7 methods from different machine learning families are reviewed: k-nearest neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN and recurrent ANN), Sequence-learning, and Stream-learning The methods selected are a representative sample of what is being used nowadays with wearable measurements. Results Methods are analyzed in terms of user interpretation, time, memory and adaptation (i.e. capacity of following physiological changes of the persons). High granularity representations that maintains the time order of the original data are the knowledge representation methods that exhibit the higher performance when combined with stream data learning. Other simple methods, as kNN have closer results to the best while offering excellent adaptation outcomes. Conclusions Wearable sensors provide from raw data to which several artificial intelligence methods can be applied to support either clinical or patients' decisions.

CHILL treats parser acquisition as the learning of search-control rules within a logic program representing a shift-reduce parser and uses techniques from Inductive Logic Programming to learn relational control knowledge. Starting with a general framework for constructing a suitable logical form, CHILL is able to train on a corpus comprising sentences paired with database queries and induce parsers that map subsequent sentences directly into executable queries. Experimental results with a complete database-query application for U.S. geography show that CHILL is able to learn parsers that outperform a preexisting, hand-crafted counterpart.

This problem is important to city planners to evaluate and develop urban deployment plans. However, this task is challenging. Traditional traffic estimation approaches lack the ability to solve this problem, since no data about the impact can be collected before the deployment and old data fails to capture the traffic pattern changes. In this paper, we define the off-deployment traffic estimation problem as a traffic generation problem, and develop a novel deep generative model TrafficGAN that captures the shared patterns across spatial regions of how traffic conditions evolve according to travel demand changes and underlying road network structures. In particular, TrafficGAN captures the road network structures through a dynamic filter in the dynamic convolutional layer.

Since it is time-consuming and expensive to acquire abundant labeled data, transfer learning becomes necessary for HAR by transferring knowledge from existing domains. However, there are two challenges existing in cross-dataset activity recognition. The first challenge is source domain selection. Given a target task and several available source domains, it is difficult to determine how to select the most similar source domain to the target domain such that negative transfer can be avoided. The second one is accurately activity transfer. After source domain selection, how to achieve accurate knowledge transfer between the selected source and the target domain remains another challenge. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Transfer Learning (ASTTL) approach to tackle both of the above two challenges in cross-dataset HAR. ASTTL learns the spatial features in transfer learning by adaptively evaluating the relative importance between the marginal and conditional probability distributions. Besides, it captures the temporal features via incremental manifold learning. Therefore, ASTTL can learn the adaptive spatial-temporal features for cross-dataset HAR and can be used for both source domain selection and accurate activity transfer. We evaluate the performance of ASTTL through extensive experiments on 4 public HAR datasets, which demonstrates its effectiveness. Furthermore, based on ASTTL, we design and implement an adaptive cross-dataset HAR system called Client-Cloud Collaborative Adaptive Activity Recognition System (3C2ARS) to perform HAR in the real environment. By collecting activities in the smartphone and transferring knowledge in the cloud server, ASTTL can significantly improve the performance of source domain selection and accurate activity transfer.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3369818", "venue": "IMWUT", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3003860764", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["29192939", "13178535", "12794304", "9038218", "63308791", "15978939", "207599948", "49562292", "49428582", "198147615", "39833979", "11155203", "43993788", "4041743", "58588119", "6996688", "6742009", "10337178", "10742222", "1993257", "7626104", "1872039", "43953426", "24136410", "14427604", "7547243", "43958917", "54463999", "212809622", "43665409", "12121632", "13798326", "17105302", "214890197", "6953522", "59566327", "85518897", "10337279", "6049788", "21250610", "4655047", "52111348", "29855370", "16439870", "12453047", "17493226", "202660978", "6480652", "207330385", "1236130", "91184316", "49883347", "49902207", "13713157", "1605434", "202660604", "91186860", "6870922", "13322062", "15019934", "26990683"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209393377"}

For building SVM-based activity recognizer, it is necessary to use suitable kernel that match sequences of feature vectors. Such kernels are called sequence kernels. In this work, we propose different sequence kernels like modified time flexible kernel, segment level pyramid match kernel, segment level probability sequence kernel and segment level Fisher kernel for matching videos when segments are represented using an encoded feature vector representation.

Representation-based approaches (e.g., sparse representation-based and neighbor embedding-based schemes) decompose the input images using sophisticated regularization techniques. They give reasonably good reconstruction performance. However, in real application scenarios, the input images are often noisy, blurry, or suffer from other unknown degradations. Traditional face super-resolution techniques treat image noise at the pixel level without considering the underlying image structures. In order to rectify this shortcoming, we propose in this paper a unified framework for representation-based face super-resolution by introducing a locality-constrained low-rank representation (LLR) scheme to reveal the intrinsic structures of input images. The low-rank representation part of LLR clusters an input image into the most accurate subspace from a global dictionary of atoms, while the locality constraint enables recovery of local manifold structures from local patches. In addition, low-rank, sparsity, locality, accuracy, and robustness of the representation coefficients are exploited in LLR via regularization. Experiments on the FEI, CMU face database, and real surveillance scenario show that LLR outperforms the state-of-the-art face super-resolution algorithms (e.g., convolutional neural network-based deep learning) both objectively and subjectively.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2717963", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2642849260", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5445052", "124415418", "4248647", "9772983", "2594359", "212123", "10952904", "54486698", "393948", "122425788", "412959", "1275833", "14698534", "14806479", "8334864", "10349990", "7336648", "7327301", "26926035", "2064", "24176337", "19060231", "22623733", "207322487", "206752226", "40077539", "2105943", "2876888", "5673540", "15078332", "265826", "556331", "41143921", "6718692", "3574048", "2312143", "12535216", "6593498", "122523836", "6329825", "49388421", "207761262", "10649298", "3276014", "40120983"], "inbound_citations": ["129944373", "13669244", "210695289", "4561179", "53737522", "199441046", "49569459", "149493149", "3884813", "150263723", "195064543", "59616361", "41244386", "209525557", "59540723", "44063566", "202561594", "195774404", "71150953", "169035429", "52197627", "53045079", "4888609", "52153796", "208071833", "19524757", "19177092"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:24745305"}

Early applications have focused on protein expression profiles to differentiate among various types of tissue samples (e.g. normal versus tumor).

The raw spectra are similar to spectra of tissue samples, raising some of the same statistical issues (e.g. non-uniform baselines and higher noise associated with higher baseline), but are substantially noisier.

These comprise a standardization step and a denoising step. The noise level for each spectrum is determined using only data from that spectrum. Only spectral features that exceed a threshold defined by the noise level are subsequently used for classification. Using this approach, we trained the Random Forest program to classify 240 mass spectra into four bacterial types. The method resulted in zero prediction errors in the training samples and in two test datasets having 240 and 300 spectra, respectively. ::: ::: Availability: Fortran code for standardization and denoising is available at the supplementary information website. ::: ::: Supplementary information: http://www.stat.uga.edu/~datta/Massspec/supp.html", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "15217815", "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/bth372", "venue": "Bioinformatics", "journal": "Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2120968240", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["6091654", "15335645", "208047712", "14170117", "976288", "13287168", "34377440", "955930", "549468", "2733884", "699285", "37990799", "44829862", "1556668", "2533984", "36028605", "17791327", "1890522", "42822074", "27392204", "6944829", "205287434", "85449132", "43793517", "54464596", "426620", "215270158", "34761870"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1829454"}

This location includes unique mountainous and lowland microclimates, but only limited knowledge exists about the impact of relief and regional atmospheric circulation patterns on precipitation origin, transport, and isotopic composition. Therefore, the main scope of this project is to identify the key drivers controlling stable isotope variations in daily-scale precipitation of Costa Rica. The monitoring sites comprise three strategic locations across Costa Rica: Heredia (Central Valley), Turrialba (Caribbean slope), and Cano Seco (South Pacific slope). Sporadic dry season rain is mostly related to isolated enriched events ranging from \u22125.8\u2030 to \u22120.9\u2030 \u03b4 18 O. By mid-May, the Intertropical Convergence Zone reaches Costa Rica resulting in a notable depletion in isotope ratios (up to \u221218.5\u2030 \u03b4 18 O). HYSPLIT air mass back trajectories indicate the strong influence on the origin and transport of precipitation of three main moisture transport mechanisms, the Caribbean Low Level Jet, the Colombian Low Level Jet, and localized convection events. Multiple linear regression models constructed based on Random Forests of surface meteorological information and atmospheric sounding profiles suggest that lifted condensation level and surface relative humidity are the main factors controlling isotopic variations. These findings diverge from the recognized \u2018amount effect\u2019 in monthly composite samples across the tropics. Understanding of stable isotope dynamics in tropical precipitation can be used to a) enhance groundwater modeling efforts in ungauged basins where scarcity of long-term monitoring data drastically limit current and future water resources management, b) improve the re-construction of paleoclimatic records in the Central American land bridge, c) calibrate and validate regional circulation models.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.quascirev.2015.08.028", "venue": null, "journal": "Quaternary Science Reviews", "mag_id": "1840115759", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["134084936", "132347208", "133773720", "54018175", "899198", "134934206", "54799657", "133774597", "134807422", "207282225", "133853449", "203852472", "134901813", "135322201", "133469705", "130462761", "202688787", "133710328", "133669825", "133848443"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:128522344"}

These modifications include the estimation of confidence factors that characterize the possible impacts of all error sources on radar measurements, the assignment of the matrix of weights that characterizes the classification power of each variable with respect to every class of radar echo, and the implementation of a class designation system based on the distance from the radar and the parameters of the melting layer that are determined as functions of azimuth with polarimetric radar measurements.

The idea is to use GA to find the optimal values of hyper-parameters of LS-SVM and adopts a supervised learning approach to train the LS-SVM model.

Dimensional characterizations of emotion can capture this variability by describing emotion in terms of its properties (e.g., valence, positive vs. negative, and activation, calm vs. excited). However, in many emotion recognition systems, this variability is often considered \"noise\" and is attenuated by averaging across raters. Yet, inter-rater variability provides information about the subtlety or clarity of an emotional expression and can be used to describe complex emotions. In this paper, we investigate methods that can effectively capture the variability across evaluators by predicting emotion perception as a discrete probability distribution in the valence-activation space. We propose: (1) a label processing method that can generate two-dimensional discrete probability distributions of emotion from a limited number of ordinal labels; (2) a new approach that predicts the generated probabilistic distributions using dynamic audio-visual features and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Our experimental results on the MSP-IMPROV corpus suggest that the proposed approach is more effective than the conventional Support Vector Regressions (SVRs) approach with utterance-level statistical features, and that feature-level fusion of the audio and video modalities outperforms decision-level fusion. The proposed CNN model predominantly improves the prediction accuracy for the valence dimension and brings a consistent performance improvement over data recorded from natural interactions. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of generating emotion distributions from limited number of labels and predicting the distribution using dynamic features and neural networks.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3136755.3136792", "venue": "ICMI 2017", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2767546953", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1493342", "1919851", "41350591", "11820063", "15011148", "961425", "142736456", "305265", "10075571", "1347614", "6122620", "10367935", "9969117", "9296806", "792185", "40022698", "1774023", "4129626", "206651806", "2890641", "17609995", "11470721", "38638469", "8924091", "15136672", "206742471", "6992992", "10285917", "15157188", "12469750", "26303226", "5372233", "5732528", "14563993", "717077"], "inbound_citations": ["202540864", "202121093", "85543237", "70308507", "145866811", "85543064", "199543302", "52897419"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4176780"}

An accurate and reproducible automatic segmentation is of high interest, since the lesion volume is an important end-point for clinical trials.

Within this context, a multi-spectral classification approach is compared against mono-spectral classification performance using only FLAIR MRI datasets and two sets of expert segmentations are used for inter-observer agreement evaluation. ::: ::: ::: Results and Conclusion ::: The results of this study reveal that high-level machine learning methods lead to significantly better segmentation results compared to the rather simple classification methods, pointing towards a difficult non-linear problem. The overall best segmentation results were achieved by a Random Decision Forest and a Convolutional Neural Networks classification approach, even outperforming all previously published results.

First, the correlation between the phosphorus content of the cucumber leaf and the spectral reflectance was analyzed but high coefficient was not obtained. It was shown that there is not high linear relation between those. Then, the analysis was conducted between the phosphorus content of the cucumber leaf and the first derivative of spectrum for each sample. The coefficients were improved.

In this work, we propose a noise level estimation algorithm by combining the overestimation and underestimation results. Based on this, we further propose an adaptive boosting algorithm that excludes intricate parameter configuration. Moreover, we prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm.

The proposed method utilizes a supervoxel structure to organize the point clouds, and then extracts the detrended geometric features from the local context of supervoxels. Combined with the detrended features of the local context, the Random Forest (RF) classifier will be adopted to obtain the initial semantic labeling results of trees from point clouds. Afterwards, a local context-based regularization is iteratively performed to achieve global optimum on a global graphical model, in order to spatially smoothing the semantic labeling results. Finally, a graph-based segmentation is conducted to separate individual trees according to the semantic labeling results. The use of supervoxel structure can preserve the geometric boundaries of objects in the scene, and compared with point-based solutions, the supervoxel-based method can largely decrease the number of basic elements during the processing. Besides, the introduction of supervoxel contexts can extract the local information of an object making the feature extraction more robust and representative. Detrended geometric features can get over the redundant and in-salient information in the local context, so that discriminative features are obtained. Benefiting from the regularization process, the spatial smoothing is obtained based on initial labeling results from classic classifications such as RF classification. As a result, misclassification errors are removed to a large degree and semantic labeling results are thus smoothed. Based on the constructed global graphical model during the spatially smoothing process, a graph-based segmentation is applied to partition the graphical model for the clustering the instances of trees. The experiments on two test datasets have shown promising results, with an accuracy of the semantic labeling of trees reaching around 0.9.

The important key to treat the breast cancer is early detection of it because according to many pathological studies more than 80% of all abnormalities are still benign at primary stages; so in recent years, many studies and extensive research done to early detection of breast cancer with higher precision and accuracy.Infra-red breast thermography is an imaging technique based on recording temperature distribution patterns of breast tissue. Compared with breast mammography technique, thermography is more suitable technique because it is noninvasive, non-contact, passive and free ionizing radiation.In this paper, a full automatic high accuracy technique for classification of suspicious areas in thermogram images with the aim of assisting physicians in early detection of breast cancer has been presented. Proposed algorithm consists of four main steps: pre-processing & segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection and classification. At the first step, using full automatic operation, region of interest (ROI) determined and the quality of image improved. Using thresholding and edge detection techniques, both right and left breasts separated from each other. Then relative suspected areas become segmented and image matrix normalized due to the uniqueness of each person's body temperature. At feature extraction stage, 23 features, including statistical, morphological, frequency domain, histogram and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) based features are extracted from segmented right and left breast obtained from step 1. To achieve the best features, feature selection methods such as minimum Redundancy and Maximum Relevance (mRMR), Sequential Forward Selection (SFS), Sequential Backward Selection (SBS), Sequential Floating Forward Selection (SFFS), Sequential Floating Backward Selection (SFBS) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) have been used at step 3. Finally to classify and TH labeling procedures, different classifiers such as AdaBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), NaA\u00afve Bayes (NB) and probability Neural Network (PNN) are assessed to find the best suitable one. These steps are applied on different thermogram images.The results obtained on native database showed the best and significant performance of the proposed algorithm in comprise to the similar studies. According to experimental results, GA combined with AdaBoost with the mean accuracy of 85.33% and 87.42% on the left and right breast images with 0 degree, GA combined with AdaBoost with mean accuracy of 85.17% on the left breast images with 45 degree and mRMR combined with AdaBoost with mean accuracy of 85.15% on the right breast images with 45 degree, and also GA combined with AdaBoost with a mean accuracy of 84.67% and 86.21%, on the left and right breast images with 90 degree, are the best combinations of feature selection and classifier for evaluation of breast images.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4786959", "pubmed_id": "27014608", "doi": "10.4103/2228-7477.175866", "venue": "Journal of Medical Signals and Sensors", "journal": "Journal of Medical Signals and Sensors", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2270296303", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["26240248", "45272443", "11576688", "58122588", "20146508", "23292374", "44032594", "26793641", "10665144", "10960052", "2153288", "131054122", "10241618", "13341915", "74671006", "45974556", "206764015", "31707429", "12795832", "60839207", "6644398", "2329907", "194951", "16571709", "15019091", "195627057", "5517845"], "inbound_citations": ["55857089", "215513737", "52141797", "59330997", "1086952", "28244623", "86606950", "211055331", "53577950", "9370429", "211687712"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:627339"}

Robots in elder care, nannybots, autonomous combat systems for the military \u2013 these are just a few of the systems that researchers are considering. In other words, one motivation for doing machine ethics is to support practical applications. A second reason for doing work in machine ethics is to try to better understand ethical reasoning as humans do it. This paper is motivated by the second of the two reasons (which, by the way, need not be construed as mutually exclusive). There has been extensive discussion of the relationship between rules, principles, or standards, on the one hand, and cases on the other. Roughly put, those stressing the importance of the former tend to get labeled generalists, whereas those stressing the importance of the latter tend to get labeled particularists. There are many ways of being a particularist or a generalist. The dispute between philosophers taking up these issues is not a first-order normative dispute about ethical issues.

However, the contents of these collected videos are often complicated, and how to efficiently perform set modeling and feature extraction is a big challenge for set-based classification algorithms. In recent years, some proposed image set classification methods have made a considerable advance by modeling the original image set with covariance matrix, linear subspace, or Gaussian distribution. As a matter of fact, most of them just adopt a single geometric model to describe each given image set, which may lose some other useful information for classification. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel algorithm to model each image set from a multi-geometric perspective. Specifically, the covariance matrix, linear subspace, and Gaussian distribution are applied for set representation simultaneously. In order to fuse these multiple heterogeneous Riemannian manifoldvalued features, the well-equipped Riemannian kernel functions are first utilized to map them into high dimensional Hilbert spaces.

In the last decade, many researchers have been keen to develop different hypergraph models. In contrast, no much attention has been paid to the design of hyperedge weighting schemes. However, many studies on pairwise graphs showed that the choice of edge weight can significantly influence the performances of such graph algorithms. We argue that this also applies to hypergraphs. In this paper, we empirically study the influence of hyperedge weights on hypergraph learning via proposing three novel hyperedge weighting schemes from the perspectives of geometry, multivariate statistical analysis, and linear regression. Extensive experiments on ORL, COIL20, JAFFE, Sheffield, Scene15 and Caltech256 datasets verified our hypothesis for both classification and clustering problems. For each of these classes of problems, our empirical study concludes with suggesting a suitable hypergraph weighting scheme. Moreover, the experiments also demonstrate that the combinations of such weighting schemes and conventional hypergraph models can achieve competitive classification and clustering performances in comparison with some recent state-of-the-art algorithms.

These methods were used to estimate runoff of various stations in the catchment area in Upper Krishna basin, Maharashtra State, India, and discussed here two stations namely Shigaon and Gudhe. The specialty of these catchment areas is Shigaon has large area and Gudhe has small area. This was done to see the model performance in both conditions.

The quantitative analysis was carried out to check the performance of the accuracy by considering standard statistical performance evaluation metrics and the scatter plots are drawn for evaluating qualitative performances of the developed models. The effect of the various metrological parameters as an input parameter for the rainfall was also investigated.The performance of both the tools was judged with various performance measures and it is found that the results are quite encouraging.

The drilling device is composed of three components: rotary unit, percussive unit and penetrating unit. The rotary-percussion drill can work in two different operating modes: rotary mode and rotary-percussive mode, depending on the properties of cut object. In the relatively loose regolith, rotation and penetration can make the drill work in a well state. However, once rock is encountered in the drilling process, besides rotation and penetration, percussion must be launched to reduce the drilling power and the required penetrating force. Due to the indetermination of the lunar environment, it is not easy to control the coring drill to adapt to the encountered conditions. To obtain a high coring ratio with relatively low power, an intelligent drilling strategy is inevitably proposed to accomplish the drilling process control. Considering the lunar soil simulant should cover the possible composition of real lunar soil, simulant are classified into several levels based on the generalized drillability. For each level of drillability of lunar soil simulant, experiments are conducted to get the characteristics in frequency-domain of rotary torque output. The sampled characteristics of rotary torque output are utilized to train the object-recognition system based on Support Vector Machine (SVM). Information in all the levels of drillability of lunar soil simulant is stored in the object-recognition system as an expert system. To understand the properties of the drilling object, rotary torque is selected to identify the level of drillability of simulant in drilling process. Subsequently, once the level is obtained, drilling strategy is adjusted to adapt to the current level correspondingly in real time. Experiments are conducted to verify the intelligent drilling strategy successfully.Copyright \u00a9 2013 by ASME", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1115/IMECE2013-62804", "venue": "Volume 4A: Dynamics, Vibration and Control", "journal": "Volume 4A: Dynamics, Vibration and Control", "mag_id": "1990859639", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:109266617"}

Any tool which can accurately determine the leak\u2019s flow rate could be used by water industry practitioners in order to prioritise leakage repair activities by repairing the higher leak flow rates first. This will result in economic savings through reduced water lost and better allocation of company resources.

The aim of the research is to develop a tool in order to predict leak flow rate using acoustic emission sensors. The research uses Least Squares- Support Vector Machines in order to predict leak flow rate in MDPE pipe using high quality data from a unique experimental pipe rig.

In this paper, based on one observation that normal users and malicious crawlers have different short-term and long-term download behaviours, we develop a new anti-crawler mechanism called PathMarker to detect and constrain persistent distributed crawlers. By adding a marker to each Uniform Resource Locator (URL), we can trace the page that leads to the access of this URL and the user identity who accesses this URL. With this supporting information, we can not only perform more accurate heuristic detection using the path related features, but also develop a Support Vector Machine based machine learning detection model to distinguish malicious crawlers from normal users via inspecting their different patterns of URL visiting paths and URL visiting timings. In addition to effectively detecting crawlers at the earliest stage, PathMarker can dramatically suppress the scraping efficiency of crawlers before they are detected. We deploy our approach on an online forum website, and the evaluation results show that PathMarker can quickly capture all 6 open-source and in-house crawlers, plus two external crawlers (i.e., Googlebots and Yahoo Slurp).", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1186/s42400-019-0023-1", "venue": null, "journal": "Cybersecurity", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2924157328", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15198286", "2146921", "2937264", "6932358", "17122765", "17017672", "961425", "13207695", "1824935", "2227749", "6328916", "59868032", "17734164", "10346150", "6640293", "15187117", "18720745", "11546744", "23327720", "15124846", "2254340", "1553099", "1292373", "29772736", "11834109", "41020954", "15437068", "43773641", "23725102", "17308534", "7926005"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:75137748"}

However, the need for a large number of training data makes the scalability of this approach problematic. In this paper, we explore the recently proposed paradigm of attribute based category recognition for object category recognition without using any visual examples. This goal is achieved by introducing a textual based attribute representation of an image and using these attributes for object categorization. We propose the Sparse Representations (SRs) framework to achieve training-free and highly scalable attribute prediction. We investigate different approaches in mapping the predicted attributes to object classes using Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machines. Experimental results suggest that the use of the SRs framework in conjunction with an appropriate Nearest Neighbors scheme can improve prediction accuracy at a much lower computational cost.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/WNYIPW.2010.5649768", "venue": "2010 Western New York Image Processing Workshop", "journal": "2010 Western New York Image Processing Workshop", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2088715375", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14940757", "10301835", "7033413", "206737254", "207020771", "7677466", "62091811", "16651228", "2990061", "14634280", "12009862", "961425"], "inbound_citations": ["14556"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15578528"}

In using steganography, the third party can extract the embedded secret easily by comparing the cover data and the hidden message if the cover data are publicly available (e.g. accessible in the internet). To avoid this problem, we need a unique cover datum for each piece of secret messages. As the cover data, we focus on digital images in this study. To make a lot of unique and natural looking images, we can use GAN. Actually, training of GAN results in two neural networks namely the generator and the discriminator. The generator makes virtual images, and the discriminator evaluates the naturalness of the virtual images. In the proposed method, we use both the generator and the discriminator to guarantee the naturalness of the cover data on the sender side, and to filter out stego data sent from malicious third party. In this experiments, we first confirmed the capability of the generator for producing unlimited number of cover data, and then investigated the possibility of naturalness checking using the discriminator.

This dissertation is concerned with data-driven, machine learning-based methods for the latter - the identification of rhetorical discourse relations between abstract objects, including events, states and propositions. Our focus is specifically on those relations based on the semantic content of their arguments as opposed to the intent of the writer. ::: We formulate a dependency view of discourse in which the arguments of a rhetorical relation are lexical heads, rather than arbitrary segments of text. This avoids the difficult problem of identifying the most elementary segments of the discourse. The resulting discourse parsing problem involves the following steps: (1) identification of discourse cue phrases that signal a rhetorical relation (2) identification of the two arguments of a rhetorical relation signaled by a discourse cue phrase and (3) determination of the type of the rhetorical relation. ::: To address the above problems, we apply a set of discriminative, statistical machine learning algorithms and explore the tradeoffs with various sets of features. We demonstrate how performance can be improved through learning architectures that allow for multiple co-dependent processing stages to be handled within a single model, rather than as a cascade of separate models. We capture additional dependencies with the novel application sequence-structured Conditional Random Fields to the problem of identifying discourse relations and their rhetorical types. The proposed Conditional Random Field model is more general than typically utilized in the literature, making use of non-factored feature functions to arrive at a conditional, sequential ranking model. ::: Finally, we demonstrate the general applicability of our proposed discourse parsing model by applying it to the problem of syntactic dependency parsing, itself an important determinant for discourse parsing.

Data were associated to 55 predictor variable layers in the (ASCII) raster format and were used in order to develop the HSM by means of a Random Forest, a very effective Machine Learning technique. Knowledge about the distribution of Cystoseira canopies was available for about the 14% of the Mediterranean coastline. Absence data were available only for the 2% of the basin. Despite these gaps, our HSM showed high accuracy levels in reproducing Cystoseira distribution so that the first continuous maps of the habitat across the entire basin was produced. Misclassification errors mainly occurred in the eastern and southern part of the basin, where large gaps of knowledge emerged. The most relevant drivers were the geomorphological ones, followed by anthropogenic variables proxies of pollution and urbanization.

Count features, such as sentence word count, sentence article count, etc. had the greatest influence on the system, while the sentence features had the second most influence. Surprisingly, most of the pitch features had no effect on the accuracy. A small common word list was also used, that proved to be very helpful. The edit distance measure of the sentences with the common words removed had a positive effect; measurable differences could be found with and without the common words included in the sentences. Due to the small size of the training and testing sets, it was found that the different groupings of the L1 languages of the speakers had a significant effect on the accuracy of the classification predictions. Certain combinations of L1 training and test sets had a higher accuracy rating depending on the L1 languages used in training or test. The classification predictions had a variance as much as 40%.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/UKCI.2012.6335766", "venue": "2012 12th UK Workshop on Computational Intelligence (UKCI)", "journal": "2012 12th UK Workshop on Computational Intelligence (UKCI)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1997755159", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["64267921", "14115528", "1884026", "14322648", "43808938", "14727192", "26477098", "57146809", "11770754", "62447423", "60531168", "6444367"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8360663"}

This approach is inspired by the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) of Tipping (2001), which uses a Bayesian hierarchical linear model to do sparse estimation. RVM was originally introduced to obtain sparse solutions in the case of kernel regression where one has many highly correlated bases (features). Extending the RVM algorithm, we include a proper prior distribution for the precisions of the regression coefficients along with a hyper-parameter to be chosen. Based upon this model, we derive the full set of conditional posterior distributions for parameters as would typically be done when applying Gibbs sampling. However, instead of simulating samples from the posterior distribution in order to estimate posterior means of quantities, we apply the Lindley-Smith mechanism (Lindley and Smith, 1972). This approach sequentially maximizes the conditional distributions, in order to find the joint maximum of the posterior distribution given the value of the hyper-parameter. An empirical Bayes method is proposed for choosing this hyperparameter leading to ARiS-eB. Having moved from a Bayes argument, we also look at the problem from a penalized least squares estimation angle.

It opened a whole new venue for research under the name \u201csocial computing\u201d. Researchers are interested in profiling individuals (e.g., gender, age group), groups, community, and networking. We are interested in studying the collective behavior of Arabic social media users. Most studies covering Arabic social media has focused on the sentiment analysis of, say tweets. This study, however, looks into who and when users interact with the Arabic social media. Specifically, there are two objectives of this work. First, studying the demographic posting behavior of social media users from two different perspectives: gender and educational level. Second, author profiling. Identifying author\u2019s gender of a social media post. We use Saudi Arabia, a very prolific country when it comes to social media in general, as a backdrop for this study. The results in this study are based on mining huge amount of metadata of a popular local social media forum covering the period 2011\u201314 inclusive. The extracted features (normalized list of k highest scoring words, and likewise for stems) from the posts were used to train classifiers to identify the author\u2019s gender. We used two different classifiers, Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear kernel and 1-NN (1-nearest neighbor), and experimented with different sizes for the list of features. When the number of features (size of the features vector) is small (\u2264 50) both classifiers perform equally well in identifying the author\u2019s gender, but we risk overfitting the data. The classifiers achieved their best result when using 100 features. The 1-NN classifier delivered a better performance, achieving a balanced accuracy of 93.16% vs 87.33% for the SVM in predicting the author\u2019s gender.

Global extinction risk assessments of an entire family of ecologically complex marine fishes (family: Sparidae), using the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List process, showed that 8.6% (13 species) of sparids are threatened. Intense fishing pressure and habitat destruction are the main reasons for the observed population declines. A further 7.9% (12 species) are classified as Near Threatened. The majority of the sparids (69.5%) are assessed as Least Concern, and these tended to have smaller body sizes, more widespread distributions, and shorter life spans. The remaining 21 species (13.9%) are listed as Data Deficient. In addition to presenting the first global assessment of sparid extinction risk, a Random Forest model identified correlates of extinction risk in the Sparidae using 33 biological and threat variables. The model correctly classified up to 90% of Red List category placements and showed complex interactions between intrinsic and extrinsic predictors. Larger body size was the most important predictor of extinction risk. Sparids with greater maximum sizes, ages, and turnover rates are at higher extinction risk. Conversely, lower area of occupancy and depth limit confer elevated risk.

Toward that goal, the authors propose a novel representation for the recognition of protein\u2013protein interaction sites that integrates enhanced relative solvent accessibility (RSA) predictions with high resolution structural data. An observation that RSA predictions are biased toward the level of surface exposure consistent with protein complexes led the authors to investigate the difference between the predicted and actual (i.e., observed in an unbound structure) RSA of an amino acid residue as a fingerprint of interaction sites. The authors demonstrate that RSA prediction-based fingerprints of protein interactions significantly improve the discrimination between interacting and noninteracting sites, compared with evolutionary conservation, physicochemical characteristics, structure-derived and other features considered before. On the basis of these observations, the authors developed a new method for the prediction of protein\u2013protein interaction sites, using machine learning approaches to combine the most informative features into the final predictor. For training and validation, the authors used several large sets of protein complexes and derived from them nonredundant representative chains, with interaction sites mapped from multiple complexes. Alternative machine learning techniques are used, including Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks, so as to evaluate the relative effects of the choice of a representation and a specific learning algorithm. The effects of induced fit and uncertainty of the negative (noninteracting) class assignment are also evaluated. Several representative methods from the literature are reimplemented to enable direct comparison of the results. Using rigorous validation protocols, the authors estimated that the new method yields the overall classification accuracy of about 74% and Matthews correlation coefficients of 0.42, as opposed to up to 70% classification accuracy and up to 0.3 Matthews correlation coefficient for methods that do not utilize RSA prediction-based fingerprints.

For example, a pollination interaction may be more likely if the proportions of a bee's tongue fit a plant's flower shape. Empirical estimates of the importance of trait-matching for determining species interactions, however, vary significantly among different types of ecological networks. Here, we show that ambiguity among empirical trait-matching studies may have arisen at least in parts from using overly simple statistical models. Using simulated and real data, we contrast conventional generalized linear models (GLM) with more flexible Machine Learning (ML) models (Random Forest, Boosted Regression Trees, Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, naive Bayes, and k-Nearest-Neighbor), testing their ability to predict species interactions based on traits, and infer trait combinations causally responsible for species interactions. We find that the best ML models can successfully predict species interactions in plant-pollinator networks, outperforming GLMs by a substantial margin. Our results also demonstrate that ML models can better identify the causally responsible trait-matching combinations than GLMs. In two case studies, the best ML models successfully predicted species interactions in a global plant-pollinator database and inferred ecologically plausible trait-matching rules for a plant-hummingbird network, without any prior assumptions. We conclude that flexible ML models offer many advantages over traditional regression models for understanding interaction networks. We anticipate that these results extrapolate to other ecological network types. More generally, our results highlight the potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence for inference in ecology, beyond standard tasks such as image or pattern recognition.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1908.09853", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1111/2041-210X.13329", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2970584612", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["12379604", "82954532", "88522102", "44848308", "87943380", "3401224", "15700257", "1410664", "27867893", "17241040", "62729017", "53318695", "4650265", "13485105", "60486887", "84853378", "17528468", "10315246", "196629699", "24623908", "3767412", "8432475", "205123924", "62790820", "7955044", "16884658", "4892233", "54794177", "16946701", "3342225", "215088646", "24553804", "88191088", "17847793", "52283577", "207475120", "9057310", "3074096", "84335456", "44065812", "24190413", "747082", "49571378", "32200161", "23314751", "51928505", "52207849", "27675133", "4096252", "2521747", "205252584", "694349", "13029170", "8937634", "31088695", "1355520", "90543067", "55295091", "17282252", "205261034", "33683441", "2089531", "20557", "18589920", "11091318", "4578200", "206667199", "61987452", "2399921", "3435087"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:201646376"}

In line-fed motors, supply voltage unbalance is another inadvertent issue which may tend to exhibit current signature similar to stator winding inter-turn insulation failure case. The proposed work presents a robust system, to identify severity of stator winding insulation faults when an induction motor with random wound stator winding works under such operating conditions. In the present work, various features obtained from time, frequency, timefrequency, and non-linear analysis of stator currents at various stator winding short circuit faults and supply voltage unbalance conditions for different load levels have been studied. A Support Vector Machine based Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) algorithm is used to identify the features which can provide discrimination information related to severity of fault level, independent of supply voltage unbalance and immune to load level variations.

Annually, biomass fires burn a total area of 3.5 - 4.5 million km\u00b2 worldwide, leading to large amounts of greenhouse gases being released into the atmosphere. In consequence the fires have a significant impact on global warming. Especially due to the positive feedback created from further dehydration of the forests and in turn, a further increase in fire risks. In order to estimate the extent of the damage and to model the impact on the climate, as well as for planning in forestry and fire management, it is essential to have a precise knowledge regarding the location, the extent and the frequency of the fire incidents. Remote sensing provides a unique opportunity for this objective, as the earth's surface can be observed large-scale and with high frequency. ::: Because of their high spectral, temporal and geometric resolution, the data from the new Sentinel-2 mission has the potential to enable this task. In particular, the simultaneous observation using two identical satellites makes it possible - despite the geometric resolution of 10 m - to achieve repetition rates of 5 days and less. Therefore this thesis aims to develop a process for the automatic detection of burnt areas based on Sentinel-2 data. ::: First of all it is necessary to prepare the data for the fire detection. The preprocessing includes a coregistration, atmospheric correction and also a format conversion. In the subsequent step a method for cloud detection is developed. This serves to identify regions to the user, which carry no information on the existence of burnt areas. It also allows a reduction of computation time, as these areas are eliminated in the further processing. Finally the detection of the burnt area can be carried out. Based on an examination of the procedures and criteria from other methods, a new approach is developed. A discriminant analysis is performed to examine mono- and multitemporal features. This enables the determination of features, which are suitable for the identification of the burnt areas. For the detection of the burnt scars, a two-phase algorithm is developed. The first phase is used for a threshold based generation of seed pixels in the burnt areas. To avoid false detections, conservative criteria are empirically determined based on training data. In the second phase the neighborhood of the seed pixels is examined with more liberal criteria. For this purpose, a region growing method is combined with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, wherein the seed pixels from the first phase are used as training data. ::: In order to estimate the quality of the process, a validation is carried out. This shows that the method has a high sensitivity for detecting the burnt areas. However, it is also identified that the algorithm is not able to separate burnt areas reliably from harvested agricultural land. Furthermore, its capacity to recognize burnt areas in cloud shadows or to detect dark burnt areas is limited.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2707116933", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:116370156"}

Hence the efficiency in early diagnosis is found to be reduced. Computer Aided Detection (CAD) tool could be used as second reader to assist the radiologist which helps for early and efficient diagnosis. In this paper CAD is designed using a new algorithm named Gray level Gradient Buffering (GGB) method. The designed algorithm contains 4 steps to diagnose the mammogram. Preprocessing, Segmentation, Feature extraction and Classification. Noise and Artifacts are removed in preprocessing using 2D Median filter and ROI extraction process respectively. Segmentation is carried out using Sobel operator and the proposed GGB algorithm. The features of the segmented image are extracted using Spatial Gray level Dependence Matrix and Local Binary Pattern.

Currently, subjective patient diaries capture this information. We investigate if detection of motor signs of ON/OFF states can be achieved by using kinematic measurements from wearable sensor technology combined with a machine learning (ML) pipeline. Methods Twenty-five PD subjects (19 males, 69 \u00b1 7 years) taking levodopa performed 10-m Instrumented Stand and Walk (ISAW) tests in their ON and OFF states while wearing Ambulatory Parkinson Disease Monitoring (APDM) sensors on their sternum, wrists, lumbar and lower extremities. A neurologist scored each ISAW according to the MDS-UPDRS-III. We analyzed 98 kinematic features for significance to neurologist total motor score and ON/OFF using both statistical (repeated-measures ANOVA, step-wise mixed-model regression, likelihood-ratio test, ridge regression) and ML methods. Results Twenty-two features significantly differed between patient reported ON/OFF states, with the most significant being trunk transverse range-of-motion (RofM), arm RofM, mid-swing elevation, stride length, turn velocity, steps in turn and toe out angles. Estimates from regression model showed average difference of 14 points between OFF/ON states in total UPDRS score and 9 points when adjusted for 5 significant features for individual baseline (mean trunk transverse RofM, right arm RofM, and toe out angle having highest effect; coeff. \u22128.67, \u22125.25, \u22123.36 respectively). Several approaches were employed for predicting ON/OFF states based on these features: direct binary classification (acc = 0.56), regression to total UPDRS score (acc = 0.76), regression to PIGD sub-score (acc = 0.64), and classification of ON\u2013OFF/OFF\u2013ON transitions using feature differences (Naive Bayes: acc = 0.74, AUC = 0.78; Random Forest: acc = 0.76, AUC = 0.90). Conclusion Wearable inertial sensors hold promise for detecting ON/OFF states in PD patients using an augmented ML approach.

As reported in the literature, the performance indices of these hybrid models have proved to be better than the individual components when used alone. Hybrid models are extremely useful for reservoir characterization in petroleum engineering, which requires high-accuracy predictions for efficient exploration and management of oil and gas resources. In this paper, we have utilized the capabilities of data mining and computational intelligence in the prediction of porosity and permeability, two important petroleum reservoir characteristics, based on the hybridization of Fuzzy Logic, Support Vector Machines, and Functional Networks, using several real-life well-logs. Two hybrid models have been built. In both, Functional Networks were used to select the best of the predictor variables for training directly from input data by using its functional approximation capability with least square fitting algorithm. In the first model (FFS), the selected predictor variables were passed to Type-2 Fuzzy Logic System to handle uncertainties and extract inference rules, while Support Vector Machines made the final predictions. In the second, the selected predictor variables were passed to Support Vector Machines for training by transforming them to a higher dimensional space, and then to Type-2 Fuzzy Logic to handle uncertainties, extract inference rules and make final predictions. The simulation results show that the hybrid models perform better than the individual techniques when used alone for the same datasets with their higher correlation coefficients. In terms of execution time, the hybrid models took less time for both training and testing than the Type-2 Fuzzy Logic, but more time than Functional Networks and Support Vector Machines. This could be the price for having a better and more robust model. The hybrid models also performed better than a combination of two of the individual components, Type-2 Fuzzy Logic and Support Vector Machines, in terms of higher correlation coefficients as well as lower execution times. This is due to the effective role of Functional Networks, as a best-variable selector in the hybrid models.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2010.01.021", "venue": "Expert Syst.

However, different people experience different symptoms and different levels of severity of PD. This paper proposes a multimodal approach combining voice and image test to enhance the reliability of detecting PD patients. To substantiate this idea, we have evaluated both voice and spiral test data using various machine learning models. The results based on the two types of dataset demonstrate an excellent level of accuracy for PD identification. Pairwise correlation and k-means clustering techniques are used to extract features from the vocal dataset. In this classification problem, the highest accuracy of 95.89% is obtained using an ensemble of 3 classification models. The Pearson's correlation is used to extract features from the image dataset. The best accuracy of 99.6% is achieved using the k-Nearest Neighbors classifier in the Dynamic Spiral Test (DST). An accuracy of 98.8% and 94.9% are achieved using the Logistic Regression classifier and the Adaptive Boosting classifier on the Static Spiral Test (SST) and Stability Test on Certain Point (STCP), respectively.

Where the minority (positive) class holds greater value than the majority (negative) class and the occurrence of false negatives incurs a greater penalty than false positives, the bias may lead to adverse consequences. Our paper incorporates two case studies, each utilizing three learners, six sampling approaches, two performance metrics, and five sampled distribution ratios, to uniquely investigate the effect of severe class imbalance on Big Data analytics. The learners (Gradient-Boosted Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forest) were implemented within the Apache Spark framework. The first case study is based on a Medicare fraud detection dataset. The second case study, unlike the first, includes training data from one source (SlowlorisBig Dataset) and test data from a separate source (POST dataset). Results from the Medicare case study are not conclusive regarding the best sampling approach using Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve and Geometric Mean performance metrics. However, it should be noted that the Random Undersampling approach performs adequately in the first case study. For the SlowlorisBig case study, Random Undersampling convincingly outperforms the other five sampling approaches (Random Oversampling, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique, SMOTE-borderline1 , SMOTE-borderline2 , ADAptive SYNthetic) when measuring performance with Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve and Geometric Mean metrics. Based on its classification performance in both case studies, Random Undersampling is the best choice as it results in models with a significantly smaller number of samples, thus reducing computational burden and training time.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1186/s40537-019-0274-4", "venue": "Journal of Big Data", "journal": "Journal of Big Data", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2990580840", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1507071", "56158715", "58669818", "53164212", "140109802", "16919478", "14873510", "207155015", "1554582", "14889830", "20217152", "58458964", "56171262", "806596", "131842738", "169040960", "26644563", "62784769", "12151269", "19022510", "7359568", "1782534", "15827438", "8655826", "17830282", "13446425", "13925042", "11346384", "1438164", "1426815", "123582503", "89141", "16864990", "2884606"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208359546"}

Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) has been catering the attention for training single-layer feed forward network (SLFN) by providing higher performance in terms of fast learning speed and better accuracy. The efficiency of these models are heavily dependent on the selection of network parameters which involves hidden weights and biases. Therefore, many evolutionary algorithms have been used to enhance the performance of ELM. However, these evolutionary approaches are limited to explore the global search space, i.e. diversification. In order to obtain high quality solution, along with diversification searching the local neighbourhood i.e, intensification is required. In the proposed work, a novel method is developed where Jaya optimization algorithm and Simulated Annealing (SA) is together implemented to produce a profitable synergy. Further, adaptive technique is introduced to enhance the search process. Comparison and experiments on five micro-array datasets reveals the robustness of the proposed ELM models.

In this paper, we develop a new cloud-based computing system in the Windows Azure platform that allows users to use the Zeolite Structure Predictor (ZSP) model through a Web browser. The ZSP is a novel machine learning approach for classifying zeolite crystals according to their framework type. The ZSP can categorize entries from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database into 41 framework types. The novel automated system permits a user to calculate the vector of descriptors used by ZSP and to apply the model using the Random Forest\u2122 algorithm for classifying the input zeolite entries. The workflow presented here integrates executables in Fortran and Python for number crunching with packages such as Weka for data analytics and Jmol for Web-based atomistic visualization in an interactive compute system accessed through the Web. The compute system is robust and easy to use. Communities of scientists, engineers, and students knowledgeable in Windows-based computing should find this new workflow attractive and easy to be implemented in scientific scenarios in which the developer needs to combine heterogeneous components.

The approach assumes that we have available only a small training set of labeled samples, which we enrich with a set of guessed labelings on selected samples from the vast pool of unlabeled image pixels. Selection and label guessing is conditioned to an unsupervised classification of the image pixel spectra, and to the spatial proximity to the labeled samples in the image domain. Unlabeled pixels falling in the spatial neighborhood of a labeled training sample, and belonging to the same unsupervised class, acquire its label. Unsupervised classification can be performed by any clustering technique, in this paper we have resorted to the classical K-means. The classifier built from the enriched training dataset is applied to the entire hyperspectral image. Finally, we perform a spatial regularization of the classification label image, maximizing a rather general prior smoothness criterion, by the selection of the most frequent class in each pixel neighborhood.

One drawback of the commonly used unsupervised deep feature learning methods is that for supervised or semi-supervised learning tasks, the information in the target variables are not used until the final stage when the classifier or regressor is trained on the learned features. This could lead to over-generalized features that are not competitive on the specific supervised or semi-supervised learning tasks. In this work, we describe a new learning method that combines deep feature learning on mixed labeled and unlabeled data sets. Specifically, we describe a weakly supervised learning method of a prior supervised convolutional stacked auto-encoders (PCSA), of which information in the target variables is represented probabilistically using a Gaussian Bernoulli restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). We apply this method to the decoding problem of an ECoG based Brain Computer Interface (BCI) system.

Consequently, we propose a framework that casts a variety of approaches - random walk based, matrix factorization and deep learning based - into a unified context-based optimization function. We systematically group the methods based on their similarities and differences. We study their differences which we later use to explain their performance differences (on downstream tasks). We conduct a large-scale empirical study considering 9 popular and recent UNRL techniques and 11 real-world datasets with varying structural properties and two common tasks - node classification and link prediction.

The Inception module used in GoogLeNet (a kind of CNN) has different convolution kernels of different sizes and thus can enhance the feature mining ability.

However, existing approaches to implement these maturity rating policies are either costly (because of expensive manually labeling) or inaccurate (because of no centralized controls). In this work, we aim to design and build a machine learning framework to automatically predict maturity levels for mobile Apps and the associated reasons with a high accuracy and a low cost. To this end, we take a multi-label classification approach to predict the mature contents in a given App and then label the maturity level according to a rating policy. Specifically, we extract novel features from App descriptions by leveraging deep learning technique to automatically capture the semantic similarity of pairwise words and adapt Support Vector Machine to capture label correlations with pearson correlation in a multi-label classification setting. Moreover, we evaluate our approach and various baseline methods using datasets that we collected from both App Store and Google Play.

The vital research aspects in this field mainly focus on data acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction and classification along with their feasibility in practical scenarios regarding implementation and reliability. In this article, we have demonstrated a detailed empirical exploration on Deep Neural Network (DNN) based classification system for the upper limb position invariant myoelectric signal. The classification of eight different hand movements is performed using a fully connected feed-forward DNN model and also compared with the existing machine learning tools. In our analysis, we have used a dataset consisting of the sEMG signals collected from eleven subjects at five different upper limb positions. The time domain power spectral descriptors (TDPSD) is used as the feature set to train the DNN classifier. In contrast to the prior methods, the proposed approach excludes the feature dimensionality reduction step, which in turn significantly reduce the overall complexity. As the EMG signal classification is a subject-specific problem, the DNN model is customized for each subject separately to get the best possible results. Our experimental results in various analysis frameworks demonstrate that DNN based system can outperform the other existing classifiers such as k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN), Random Forest, and Decision Tree. The average accuracy obtained among the five subjects for DNN, SVM, kNN, Random Forest and Decision Tree is 98.88%, 98.66%, 90.64%, 91.78%, and 88.36% respectively. Moreover, it can achieve competitive performance with the state-of-the-art SVM based model, even though the proposed DNN model requires minimal processing in feature engineering.

In this paper, we first introduce Dual Label Propagation (DLP) to impose consistent associations with the entire phenotype paths in predicting phenotype\u2013gene associations in Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). DLP is then used as the base model in a transfer learning framework (tlDLP) to incorporate functional annotations in Gene Ontology (GO). By simultaneously reconstructing GO term\u2013gene associations and HPO phenotype\u2013gene associations for all the genes in a protein\u2013protein interaction network, tlDLP benefits from the enriched training associations indirectly through relation with GO terms. Results: In the experiments to predict the associations between human genes and phenotypes in HPO based on human protein\u2013protein interaction network, both DLP and tlDLP improved the prediction of gene associations with phenotype paths in HPO in cross-validation and the prediction of the most recent associations added after the snapshot of the training data. Moreover, the transfer learning through GO term\u2013gene associations significantly improved association predictions for the phenotypes with no more specific known associations by a large margin.

Developing new techniques to remotely map snags and understory shrubs is therefore an important need. To address this, we first evaluated the use of LiDAR data for mapping the presence/absence of understory shrub species and different snag diameter classes important for birds (i.e. \u2265 15 cm, \u2265 25 cm and \u2265 30 cm) in a 30,000 ha mixed-conifer forest in Northern Idaho (USA). We used forest inventory plots, LiDAR-derived metrics, and the Random Forest algorithm to achieve classification accuracies of 83% for the understory shrubs and 86% to 88% for the different snag diameter classes. Second, we evaluated the use of LiDAR data for mapping wildlife habitat suitability using four avian species (one flycatcher and three woodpeckers) as case studies. For this, we integrated LiDAR-derived products of forest structure with available models of habitat suitability to derive a variety of species-habitat associations (and therefore habitat suitability patterns) across the study area. We found that the value of LiDAR resided in the ability to quantify 1) ecological variables that are known to influence the distribution of understory vegetation and snags, such as canopy cover, topography, and forest succession, and 2) direct structural metrics that indicate or suggest the presence of shrubs and snags, such as the percent of vegetation returns in the lower strata of the canopy (for the shrubs) and the vertical heterogeneity of the forest canopy (for the snags). When applied to wildlife habitat assessment, these new LiDAR-based maps refined habitat predictions in ways not previously attainable using other remote sensing technologies. This study highlights new value of LiDAR in characterizing key forest structure components important for wildlife, and warrants further applications to other forested environments and wildlife species.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rse.2009.07.002", "venue": null, "journal": "Remote Sensing of Environment", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2082012651", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["82954532", "53442523", "62878358", "2199113", "87167597", "83471352", "86574057", "40373829", "62840413", "84108635", "60985554", "133694127", "64189607", "3626971", "15245447", "84394419", "7530704", "32285759", "86806364", "18699788", "18122012", "131496133", "84002004", "84848478", "86823572", "84533629", "129088527", "5140933", "129647167", "8889207", "33832665", "44012263", "54697092", "127731210", "127952679", "84913366", "201316256", "55788984", "85040233", "13654209", "39361255", "129839543", "8683460", "162738557", "84144078", "14327012", "58919539", "86652835", "84163248", "84723556", "131456341", "8529157", "83732912", "758563", "129762683", "132280524", "126768356", "86005675", "86456071", "89375712", "128178076", "200062551", "126575034"], "inbound_citations": ["3036794", "15946312", "203127714", "53678295", "121507032", "52931567", "14625636", "54669456", "44911883", "55027746", "33512482", "43534329", "17725488", "91526047", "18022056", "133820666", "822205", "58014020", "17366080", "14133351", "6774269", "87609085", "90025491", "18364939", "12087578", "134293982", "199434269", "1322528", "90712273", "55044409", "53451846", "5331021", "91506301", "87613728", "126659788", "52085815", "84185955", "13835031", "4315008", "173171267", "59463805", "204758480", "35224652", "134015136", "55973514", "126382906", "58896217", "53369116", "12158995", "10221358", "201298674", "124174552", "55006148", "208569085", "215575038", "129799261", "3617497", "10859746", "67759855", "210906081", "58924612", "21332991", "13813564", "18036105", "140548387", "18262087", "11678417", "52096054", "4590640", "10732664", "53547016", "199480129", "42014317", "201659957", "204260326", "91990489", "121212997", "73685665", "2483815", "17793954", "7402863", "201800360", "39913386", "91177583", "6325056", "27312183", "84942691", "128351256", "33233071", "56181659", "215009674", "131448927", "35777936", "54927917", "11489814", "207659412", "89504628", "797940", "55031054"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55188432"}
