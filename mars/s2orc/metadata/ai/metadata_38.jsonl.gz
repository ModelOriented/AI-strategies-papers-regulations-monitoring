Some have thousands of reports, spanning decades. The Space Shuttle has over 100,000 reports from just the last two decades. Similarly, the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) database spans several decades and contains over 600,000 reports. These information repositories contain valuable information about system health, particularly about trends and recurring problems. However, repository volume and complexity can make human analysis dicult. Current methods for identifying recurring anomalies rely on a divide-and-conquer strategy. A system is decomposed into subsystems, and experts on those subsystems read and monitor current reports. Thus problems and anomalies can be tracked and trended. This methodology requires experts who can recall and integrate reports spanning potentially long time scales. Current reports are often related to ones from months and years past. Recall is aided by categorizing reports into specific anomaly categories. Tracking and trending are aided by monitoring category totals over time. Category utility, however, relies on the experts to correctly and consistently categorize reports. With multiple experts, inter-rater reliability must somehow be assured. Clearly, human reading, comprehension, and association with relevant prior reports, is essential to system health assurance. The weak point is in identification and recall of relevant prior reports. A decision support system that automatically analyzes reports and provides consistent discovery, characterization, and categorization would be extremely useful. This paper discusses recent innovations in the field of text mining that enable the automatic discovery of anomalies in such text repositories, using statistical and content-based clustering techniques, and the characterization and categorization of these anomalies using advanced classification algorithms. The first innovation discovers recurring anomalies using content-based and statistical clustering techniques. The system, known as the Recurring Anomaly Detection System (ReADS) performs comprehensive analysis of an entire information repository to discover recurring anomalies and presents the results in an intuitive interactive visualization for further investigation by experts. The second innovation, known as Mariana, automatically classifies documents into predetermined categories using an advanced classifier, known as a Support Vector Machine, along with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation to find the best hyperparameters for the model. Another approach to finding predetermined categories, base on Non-negative Matrix Factorization, is also showing promising results.

However, most known methods are not effective in detecting short genes. Because of the limited information contained in short DNA sequences, it is very difficult to accurately distinguish between protein coding and non-coding sequences in prokaryotic genomes. We have developed a new Iteratively Adaptive Sparse Partial Least Squares (IASPLS) algorithm as the classifier to improve the accuracy of the identification process.ResultsFor testing, we chose the short coding and non-coding sequences from seven prokaryotic organisms. We used seven feature sets (including GC content, Z-curve, etc.) of short genes.In comparison with GeneMarkS, Metagene, Orphelia, and Heuristic Approachs methods, our model achieved the best prediction performance in identification of short prokaryotic genes. Even when we focused on the very short length group ([60\u2013100 nt)), our model provided sensitivity as high as 83.44% and specificity as high as 92.8%. These values are two or three times higher than three of the other methods while Metagene fails to recognize genes in this length range.The experiments also proved that the IASPLS can improve the identification accuracy in comparison with other widely used classifiers, i.e. Logistic, Random Forest (RF) and K nearest neighbors (KNN). The accuracy in using IASPLS was improved 5.90% or more in comparison with the other methods. In addition to the improvements in accuracy, IASPLS required ten times less computer time than using KNN or RF.ConclusionsIt is conclusive that our method is preferable for application as an automated method of short gene classification. Its linearity and easily optimized parameters make it practicable for predicting short genes of newly-sequenced or under-studied species.ReviewersThis article was reviewed by Alexey Kondrashov, Rajeev Azad (nominated by Dr J.Peter Gogarten) and Yuriy Fofanov (nominated by Dr Janet Siefert).", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3852556", "pubmed_id": "24067167", "doi": "10.1186/1745-6150-8-23", "venue": "Biology Direct", "journal": "Biology Direct", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2172280957", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["2250089", "6877730", "205921887", "7291379", "10572780", "19879558", "15204948", "7786589", "35650483", "16068578", "7177854", "5854777", "16956175", "14396993", "5322427", "13997781", "8959866", "44318012", "7532431", "14569528", "3209263", "122185949", "62892640", "14916232", "5990470", "6273488"], "inbound_citations": ["215075407", "14515967", "6273488", "202554707", "12416639", "29366884"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6273488"}

In order to make effective use of the unlabeled samples which can be obtained much easier, a novel semi-supervised classification method named Elastic Sparsity Regularized Support Vector Machine (ESRSVM) is proposed for radio transmitter classification. ESRSVM first constructs an elastic-net graph over data samples to capture the robust and natural discriminating information and then incorporate the information into the manifold learning framework by an elastic sparsity regularization term. Experimental results on 10 GMSK modulated Automatic Identification System radios and 15 FM walkie-talkie radios show that ESRSVM achieves obviously better performance than KNN and SVM, which use only labeled samples for classification, and also outperforms semi-supervised classifier LapSVM based on manifold regularization.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11767-012-0911-y", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Electronics (China)", "mag_id": "2060274158", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["199013444"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62754675"}

Classification through pattern recognition using supervised learning algorithms such as SVM is popular in many fields. However, the suitability of such methods for classifying seismic data is severely hampered by assumptions of linearity (linear SVM), which affects accuracy, or computational limitations with increases in data dimension (nonlinear SVM). We propose an alternate approach to overcome this limitation, performing nonlinear SVM in a reduced dimensional space determined using kPCA. The utility of the method is demonstrated by characterizing the geologic structure using synthetically generated seismograms. We observe that our method produced a more efficient and robust classifier for seismic data than standard nonlinear SVM. Optimal SVM performance occurs when a subspace that makes up only 10% of the entire feature space is used for the training set. We also observe a greater than five times speedup in computational time between the optimal performance and standard nonlinear SVM. The results indicate that performing kPCA dimension reduction prior to classification can significantly increase performance and robustness.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACSSC.2017.8335156", "venue": "2017 51st Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers", "journal": "2017 51st Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2768556607", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["62838266", "129661957", "126537771", "6247578", "206543048", "13473158", "17929350", "130046765", "122725444", "60718910", "2474873", "549890", "6421994", "2357415", "13979484", "129639545", "54512599", "128484886", "194951", "6058027", "64543020", "13563302", "38263847", "123542082", "14669541", "7831590", "6674407", "18750250", "10659969"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4941007"}

Headnote generation is a time consuming process and there have been attempts made at automating the process.

A legal judgment can be segmented into coherent chunks based on the rhetorical roles played by the sentences. In this paper, a comprehensive system is proposed for labeling sentences with their rhetorical roles and extracting structured head notes automatically from legal judgments. An annotated data set was created with the help of legal experts and used as training data. A machine learning technique, Conditional Random Field, is applied to perform document segmentation by identifying the rhetorical roles. The present work also describes the application of probabilistic models for the extraction of key sentences and composing the relevant chunks in the form of a headnote. The understanding of basic structures and distinct segments is shown to improve the final presentation of the summary. Moreover, by adding simple additional features the system can be extended to other legal sub-domains. The proposed system has been empirically evaluated and found to be highly effective on both the segmentation and summarization tasks.

The modeled experi- ments show a pattern of learning interference which may help shed light on the structure of both short and long term stores of perceptual memory. It is our hypothesis that the observed interference patterns can be explained by the relationship of stimuli across tasks and how these relationships interact with the limits of human memory. We account for the fact that in- formation is shared across tasks in our model through use of methodology from the machine learning community on trans- fer learning. When we introduce a set of plausible limits on memory, such a model demonstrates the same pattern of learn- ing interference observed in the human experiments. Keywords: Perceptual Learning; Perceptual Memory; Con- solidation; Acquisition; Learning Interference; Transfer Learning Introduction With sufficient practice, human beings are able to enhance the acuity of their sensory systems. This is known in the literature as perceptual learning. Recent work in perceptual learning (e.g. Banai et al., 2009; Yotsumoto et al., 2008), has shown that learning on one task (which we call the target) may be prevented when a second task (which we call the distractor) is practiced either during or shortly after practice of the tar- get: this is called learning interference. These results suggest distinct properties of short and long term stores of perceptual memory because what interfered with learning during prac- tice was distinct from what interfered after practice (see the Human Data section for more detail). Our working hypothesis is that the learning interference observed in these experiments is a consequence of how infor- mation is shared across tasks and the limits of human mem- ory. We have built a computational model in an effort towards fully specifying and testing this hypothesis (see the Model- ing section for details). An ideal observer would only benefit from sharing information across tasks. However, with the in- troduction of limited memory, sharing information can also lead to learning interference. Such sharing of information across tasks is used to accom- plish transfer learning in the machine learning community. We call a computational technique intended to accomplish transfer learning, computational transfer learning. If a sys- tem (living or machine) can be seen to have better perfor- mance on one task after experience on some prior task, we call this observable transfer learning. Prior computational models of perceptual learning, though they have considered observable transfer learning, have ignored matters of compu- tational transfer learning, either by modeling only a single task (e.g. Jacobs, 2009) or by treating learning across several tasks as a single monolithic learning problem (e.g. Petrov et al., 2005). Because of this, none of these models provide an account of how people appropriately segregate and share in- formation across tasks. There are computational models con- cerned with human memory that can be understood to have some form of computational transfer learning (e.g. McClel- land et al., 1995; Anderson, 2002), but these systems do not provide the detail needed to model the current experiments. In this paper we model one set of learning interference ex- periments (Wright et al., 2009; Banai et al., 2009) using an ideal observer (Geisler, 2003). We do this by incorporating a method used for computational transfer learning (Roy & Kaelbling, 2007) (see the method section for details). On top of this ideal observer, we introduce a plausible set of mem- ory limits. This approach has the merit of avoiding conflation between task constraints (which both humans and the ideal observer are subject to) and psychological constraints (which only humans are subject to). We hypothesize memory lim- its that a.) affect the number of distinct stimuli that could be remembered and that b.) introduce a process of consol- idation, meaning that over a period of time memories move from a labile, short term form to a stable long term form. We found that when introducing all (and only all) of our limits, our model demonstrated the same pattern of learning interfer- ence observed in humans (see the evaluation for details). Human Data The experiments in Banai et al. (2009) and Wright et al. (2009) suggest two functionally distinct stages of perceptual learning. The first stage occurs during practice of a task. We call this stage acquisition. The second stage occurs af- ter practice is complete and is called consolidation.

Thus, the proper classification of the identified jumping genes is essential to understand their genetic and evolutionary effects in the genome. While computational methods have been developed that perform either binary classification or multi-label classification of TEs, few studies have focused on their hierarchical classification. The state-of-the-art machine learning classification method utilizes a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a class of neural network, for hierarchical classification of TEs.

Errors that occur on semiconductor chips can be attributed to permanent, transient or intermittent faults. Out of these errors, once permanent errors appear, they do not go away and once intermittent faults appear on chips, the probability that they will occur again is high, making these two types of faults critical. Transient faults occur very rarely, making them non-critical. Incorrect classification during manufacturing tests in case of critical faults, may result in failure of the chip during operational lifetime or decrease in product quality, whereas discarding chips with non-critical faults may result in unnecessary yield loss. Existing mechanisms to distinguish between the fault types are mostly rule-based, and as fault types start manifesting similarly as we move to lower technology nodes, these rules become obsolete over time. Hence, rules need to be updated every time the technology is changed. Machine learning approaches have shown that the uncertainty can be compensated with previous experience. In our case, the ambiguity of classification rules can be compensated by storing past classification decisions and learn from those for accurate classification.

{"paper_id": "36764216", "title": "Serial Processing in Reading Aloud: No Challenge for a Parallel Model", "authors": [{"first": "Marco", "middle": [], "last": "Zorzi", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "University of Padova and University College London K. Rastle and M. Coltheart (1999) challenged parallel models of reading by showing that the cost of irregularity in low-frequency exception words was modulated by the position of the irregularity in the word. This position-of-irregularity effect was taken as strong evidence of serial processing in reading. This article refutes Rastle and Coltheart's theoretical conclusions in 3 ways: First, a parallel model, the connectionist dual process model (M. Zorzi, G. Houghton, & B. Butterworth, 1998b), produces a position-of-irregularity effect. Second, the supposed serial effect ca~ be reduced to a position-specific grapheme-phoneme consistency effect. Third, the position-of-irregularity effect vanishes when the experimental data are reanalyzed using grapheme-phoneme consistency as the covariate. This demonstration has broader implications for studies aiming at adjudicating between models: Strong inferences should be avoided until the computational models are actually tested. The theoretical side of reading research has been given substantial impetus by the development of different (and alternative) computational models of visual word recogni- tion and reading aloud (e.g., Coltheart, Curtis, Atldns, & Hailer, 1993; Coltheart & Rastle, 1994; G-ralnger & Jacobs, 1996; Norris, 1994; Plant, McClelland, Seidenberg, & Patterson, 1996; Seidenberg & McClelland, 1989; Van Orden, Peunington, & Stone, 1990; Zorzi, Houghton, & Butterworth, 1998a, 1998b). As a consequence, recent empirical research has been strongly influenced by computa- tional theories, partly because they provide a unique oppor- tunity to generate novel (and falsifiable) detailed predictions. Three models have been shown to account for a variety of empirical data from both adult skilled oral reading and neuropsycbological disorders of reading following brain damage: the parallel distributed processing (PDP) model described by Plaut et al. (1996); the dual route cascaded (DRC) model of Coltheart et al. (1993); and the connection- ist dual process model of Zorzi, Houghton, and Butterworth (1998b). The architectures and processing assumptions of these models are remarkably different, although a fair degree of convergence toward general processing principles can be individuated. One of such principles is that the interaction between two sources of phonological information is a necessary assumption for explaining both behavioral and neuropsychological data; that is, upon presentation of a Marco Zorzi, Department of General Psychology, University of Padova~ Padova, Italy, and Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, London, England. I am grateful to Kathy Rastle for providing the original data files of the Rastle and Coltheart (1999) study, to David Plaut for running the stimuli through the parallel distributed processing model, and to Max Coltheart, Alan Kawamoto, Art Jacobs, Kathy Rastle, and Jo Ziegler for useful comments on an earlier version of this article.

Electronic mail may be sent to mzorzi@psico.unipd.it. printed word, phonological codes are retrieved through a lexical-semantic pathway (or network) as well as assembled through a spelling-sound mapping process. One theoretically important distinction between the three models regards the characterization of the phonological assembly process. In both Zorzi et al. (1998a, 1998b) and Plaut et al. (1996) models, the spelling-sound mapping route operates in parallel on the orthographic input, at least for monosyllabic words (note that all three models are limited to monosyllables). The assembly route is implemented in a neural network form, where the mapping between ortho- graphic representations and phonological representations is learned through the exposure to a large corpus of words. (In spite of these similarities, the two models differ for a number of important features, such as the sensitivity to word frequency and the ability to read exception words; see further discussion in Simulation With the Connectionist Dual Process Model below.) The phonological assembly route developed by Coltheart and colleagues (1993), how- ever, is radically different from the network models of Plant et al. (1996) and Zorzi et al. (1998a, 1998b). The so-called nonlexical route in the DRC model is a production system that is based on a set of pronunciation rules that are applied on the orthographic input. The algorithm operates serially by submitting one letter at a time to the rule system. It is important to note that this feature is a specific theoretical assumption in the DRC model and that serial processing is not strictly necessary for the rule system to operate. Computational modeling has much enlivened reading research. However, the existence of several successful models calls for a research strategy that focuses on adjudicat- ing between them. Jacobs and Gralnger (1994; also Grainger & Jacobs, 1996) discussed a number of different approaches that can be pursued to adjudicate between competing models. For example, descriptive adequacy refers to the degree of accuracy with which a model predicts a data set.

Manufacturing, especially in the developed world, is moving towards on-demand manufacturing meaning a high mix, low volume product mix. This requires efficient dispatching that can work in dynamic and stochastic environments, meaning it allows for quick response to new orders received and can work over a disparate set of shop floor settings. In this paper we address this problem of dispatching in manufacturing. Using reinforcement learning (RL), we propose a new design to formulate the shop floor state as a 2-D matrix, incorporate job slack time into state representation, and design lateness and tardiness rewards function for dispatching purpose. However, maintaining a separate RL model for each production line on a manufacturing shop floor is costly and often infeasible. To address this, we enhance our deep RL model with an approach for dispatching policy transfer. This increases policy generalization and saves time and cost for model training and data collection. Experiments show that: (1) our approach performs the best in terms of total discounted reward and average lateness, tardiness, (2) the proposed policy transfer approach reduces training time and increases policy generalization.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1910.02035", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2977949361", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["31813790", "18934144", "207233771", "38551797", "27488308", "110458122", "6017005", "4999751", "19628598", "15555911", "207244918", "7211656", "8409567", "1133863", "195881217", "106407668", "4690592", "4897770", "59769929", "15248497", "31821855", "36838772", "110166854", "6822470", "61680123", "2779960", "9166388", "19115634", "1211821", "12724401", "6244706", "27641548", "740063"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:203737246"}

While the former task may be dealt with the use of some standard text categorization techniques, the latter one is more challenging due to, first of all, a limited number of training documents. On the other hand, it is assumed that there is some natural logic, for instance, resulting from rules and regulations, behind the succession of documents within the sequences which can be exploited to make a decision as to the assignment of a new document to a proper sequence.

This idea can be extended to concept drift scenarios, where the distribution or the a posteriori probabilities may change over time. Nevertheless, in these scenarios, the classifier selection becomes not only region but also time-dependent. By adding a time dependency, in this work, we hypothesize that any DCS-based approach can be used to handle concept drift problems. Since some regions may not be affected by a concept drift, we introduce the idea of concept diversity, which shows that a pool containing classifiers trained under different concepts may be beneficial when dealing with concept drift problems through a DCS approach. The impacts of pruning mechanisms are discussed and seven well-known DCS methods are evaluated in the proposed framework, using a robust experimental protocol based on 12 common concept drift problems with different properties, and the PKLot dataset considering an experimental protocol specially designed in this work to test concept drift methods.

A new approach to forecast this drug-related toxic effect by means of the support vector machine (SVM) in the regression mode is discussed below. The efficacy of this mathematical method is compared to the results obtained in vivo. Since SVR investigates the anticonvulsant activity of the compounds more thoroughly than it is possible using animal models, this method seems to be a very helpful tool for predicting additional dose ranges at which maximum anticonvulsant activity without toxic effects is observed. Good generalizing properties of SVR allow to assess the therapeutic dose range and toxicity threshold.

In many video surveillance applications, like face recognition (FR) and person re-identification, a pair-wise matcher is used to assign a query image captured using a video camera to the corresponding reference images in a gallery. The different configurations and operational conditions of video cameras can introduce significant shifts in the pair-wise distance distributions, resulting in degraded recognition performance for new cameras. In this paper, a new deep domain adaptation (DA) method is proposed to adapt the CNN embedding of a Siamese network using unlabeled tracklets captured with a new video cameras. To this end, a dual-triplet loss is introduced for metric learning, where two triplets are constructed using video data from a source camera, and a new target camera. In order to constitute the dual triplets, a mutual-supervised learning approach is introduced where the source camera acts as a teacher, providing the target camera with an initial embedding. Then, the student relies on the teacher to iteratively label the positive and negative pairs collected during, e.g., initial camera calibration. Both source and target embeddings continue to simultaneously learn such that their pair-wise distance distributions become aligned.

Therefore, fate of any drug molecule depends on how they are treated or metabolized by CYP isoform. There is a need to develop models for predicting substrate specificity of major isoforms of P450, in order to understand whether a given drug will be metabolized or not. This paper describes an in-silico method for predicting the metabolizing capability of major isoforms (e.g. CYP 3A4, 2D6, 1A2, 2C9 and 2C19).ResultsAll models were trained and tested on 226 approved drug molecules. Firstly, 2392 molecular descriptors for each drug molecule were calculated using various softwares. Secondly, best 41 descriptors were selected using general and genetic algorithm. Thirdly, Support Vector Machine (SVM) based QSAR models were developed using 41 best descriptors and achieved an average accuracy of 86.02%, evaluated using fivefold cross-validation. We have also evaluated the performance of our model on an independent dataset of 146 drug molecules and achieved average accuracy 70.55%.

To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, GBELM-RBF is compared with other ELM algorithms on the datasets of airport expressway and Badaling expressway during November 2012 and September 2014. The root mean squared error (RMSE), accuracy and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of these methods are analyzed. The experimental results show that GBELM-RBF has the best performance. For airport expressway dataset, the RMSE is less than 3, the accuracy is 78.8% and PCC is 0.94. For Badaling expressway dataset, the RMSE is less than 3, the accuracy is 81.2% and PCC is 0.921.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICMLA.2017.00-26", "venue": "2017 16th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA)", "journal": "2017 16th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2783116631", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["135835144", "123720226", "109081942", "38027653", "138287263", "204237347", "116858", "11518324", "42323607", "15340864", "18824241"], "inbound_citations": ["58669943", "125651334"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:36598694"}

Studies and surveys in different parts of India have suggested that CKD is becoming a major concern day by day. The financial burden of the treatment and future consequences of CKD could be unaffordable to many, if not detected at an earlier stage. Motivated by this, the NN-GA model has been proposed which significantly overcomes the problem of using local search-based learning algorithms to train NNs. The input weight vector of the NN is gradually optimized by using GA to train the NN. The model has been compared with well-known classifiers like Random Forest, Multilayer Perception Feedforward Network (MLP-FFN), and also with NN. The performance of the classifiers has been measured in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-Measure. The experimental results suggest that NN-GA-based model is capable of detecting CKD more efficiently than any other existing model.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-981-10-6747-1_13", "venue": "Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing", "journal": "Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing", "mag_id": "2761207182", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["212705922", "34659245", "52901610"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:65209256"}

The new architecture leads to an automatically learned, unsupervised separation of high-level attributes (e.g., pose and identity when trained on human faces) and stochastic variation in the generated images (e.g., freckles, hair), and it enables intuitive, scale-specific control of the synthesis. The new generator improves the state-of-the-art in terms of traditional distribution quality metrics, leads to demonstrably better interpolation properties, and also better disentangles the latent factors of variation. To quantify interpolation quality and disentanglement, we propose two new, automated methods that are applicable to any generator architecture.

Fully automatic and unsupervised methods eliminate the need for manual interaction. In this paper, evaluation of potential role of the adaptive hybrid segmentation algorithm, Contourlet transform and the Extreme Learning Machine in the differential diagnosis of liver tumors in CT images are proposed. The liver is segmented from CT images using adaptive threshold method and morphological processing. Extraction of tumor is done by means of Fuzzy C Means (FCM) clustering from the segmented liver region. The statistical and textural information are obtained from the extracted tumor using Contourlet Transform. The features like mean, standard deviation and entropy of the obtained sub bands are calculated and stored in a feature vector. The extracted features are fed as input to Extreme Learning Machine classifier to classify the diseases such as hepatoma, hemangioma and cholangiocarcinoma. The segmentation results are compared with the experts results and analyzed.

This paper presents a potential solution to this problem. The robot builds representations of its target environment using Growing Neural Gas. The robot programmer then specifies its behavior for each learned node. This approach is shown to have the potential to be effective for simplifying robot behavior programming in an indoor environment with low-cost hardware. Programming reactive behaviors (Brooks 1986) on a robot equipped with basic sensors such as touch sensors and sonars is reasonably straightforward and well-understood. Despite considerable progress in computer vision techniques, use of camera images to direct reactive behaviors remains tricky. Considerable effort is often invested in computer vision algorithms that are specialized for a particular environment. (Horswill 1994) Unsupervised learning algorithms have proven to be popular tools for computer vision, especially neural network models such as the Self-Organizing Map (Kohonen 2001) and Growing Neural Gas (Fritzke 1995). These algorithms derive abstractions of subsets of image sets that can be used for later classification of previously unseen images. This paper describes an application of unsupervised learning, specifically Growing Neural Gas (GNG) to the problem of programming reactive behaviors when using computer vision as the principal sensor for a mobile robot. Behavior programming is a two-stage process. First, the robot builds a GNG network as it explores its environment. Subsequently, the programmer specifies the desired action for each learned GNG cluster. Once this specification is complete, the robot selects its actions based on the GNG cluster that is the closest match to the current input image. Learning the Environment Unsupervised Learning Unsupervised learning algorithms, such as k-means (Forgey 1965) (MacQueen 1967), the self-organizing map (SOM) (Kohonen 2001), and Growing Neural Gas (GNG) (Fritzke 1995), operate by partitioning their training inputs into clusters based on a distance metric. Each cluster is defined as a Figure 1: Portrait of the Robot representative example of the input space. Each representative example is arithmetically derived (in an algorithmdependent manner) from the training inputs. Both k-means and self-organizing maps require a fixed number of clusters to be specified in advance. Growing neural gas adaptively determines the number of clusters based on its inputs. In the interest of allowing the inputs to determine the number of clusters, we selected GNG for this task.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "MAICS", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2407578822", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["43452246", "13967530", "7317620", "8254240", "61996327", "17388986", "110735683", "198120309", "6278891", "17285730", "14844377", "1053480", "6926653"], "inbound_citations": ["7596120"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10277981"}

The results obtained show that cost-sensitive SVMs trained with unbalanced data sets achieve promising results in terms of sensitivity and specificity. The studies have shown a high potential for implementation of this system in clinical practice as a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) tool.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ISDA.2008.48", "venue": "2008 Eighth International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications", "journal": "2008 Eighth International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2122797982", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["41500024", "26031142", "78184213", "80322827", "11754681"], "inbound_citations": ["15371433", "122240194"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18506830"}

Motivated by the emergence of big data across many fields of inquiry, these methodological developments have primarily focused on the detection of communities of nodes from matrices that are very large. However, it remains unknown if the algorithms can reliably detect communities in smaller graph sizes (i.e., 1000 nodes and fewer) which are commonly used in brain research. More importantly, these algorithms have predominantly been tested only on binary or sparse count matrices and it remains unclear the degree to which the algorithms can recover community structure for different types of matrices, such as the often used cross-correlation matrices representing functional connectivity across predefined brain regions. Of the publicly available approaches for weighted graphs that can detect communities in graphs sizes of at least 1000, prior research has demonstrated that Newman\u2019s spectral approach (i.e., Leading Eigenvalue), Walktrap, Fast Modularity, the Louvain method (i.e., multilevel community method), Label Propagation, and Infomap all recover communities exceptionally well in certain circumstances. The purpose of the present Monte Carlo simulation study is to test these methods across a large number of conditions, including varied graph sizes and types of matrix (sparse count, correlation, and reflected Euclidean distance), to identify which algorithm is optimal for specific types of data matrices. The results indicate that when the data are in the form of sparse count networks (such as those seen in diffusion tensor imaging), Label Propagation and Walktrap surfaced as the most reliable methods for community detection.

Lifelong multitask learning framework may be applied to a variety of applications such as image annotation, robotics, automated machines etc, and hence, may prove to be a highly promising direction for further investigation. However, the lifelong learning framework comes with its own baggage of challenges. The biggest challenge is the fact that the characteristics of the future tasks which might be encountered by the learning agents are entirely unknown. If all the tasks are assumed to be related, there may be a risk of training from unrelated task resulting in negative transfer of information. To overcome this problem, both batch and online multitask learning algorithms learn task relationships. However, due to the unknown nature of the future tasks, learning the task relationships is also difficult in lifelong multitask learning. In this paper, we propose learning functions to model the task relationships as it is computationally cheaper in an online setting.

In this paper, we address the problem of selecting the best representation for a given sparse matrix on GPU by using a machine learning approach. First, we present some interesting and easy to compute features for characterizing the sparse matrices on GPU. Second, we use a multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to select the best format for each input matrix. We consider in this paper four popular formats (COO, CSR, ELL, and HYB), but our work can be extended to support more sparse representations. Experimental results on two different GPUs (Fermi GTX 580 and Maxwell GTX 980 Ti) show that we achieved more than 98% of the performance possible with a perfect selection.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICPP.2016.64", "venue": "2016 45th International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP)", "journal": "2016 45th International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2521497392", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11725419", "5577284", "9763118", "207191190", "2063521", "206787478", "14541849", "3943049", "15874442", "961425", "2443126", "14179309", "1493982", "10561693", "17602837", "14859861", "1905828"], "inbound_citations": ["47016946", "18376883", "203654797", "69514225", "207958958", "18446913", "52183644", "51921964", "53245692", "53245721", "208020257", "212705548", "199441102", "211519290", "26309781", "69664705", "153314094", "201131631", "22336008", "155091057", "51923887", "1465965", "195831514"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15886962"}

In previous research, peak tibial shock is typically measured and trained for one limb at a single constant training speed during all training sessions. The goal of this study was to determine how runners transfer learning in the trained limb to the untrained limb at different unconstrained speeds. Methods Thirteen runners (3 females, age = 41.1 \u00b1 6.9 yr, running experience = 6.8 \u00b1 4.4 yr, weekly running distance = 30.7 \u00b1 22.2 km) underwent running gait biofeedback retraining via continuous tibial acceleration measured at the right distal tibia. Before and after the training, participants were asked to run at their self-selected constrained training speeds (2.8 \u00b1 0.2 m\u00b7s\u22121) and at 110% and 90% of the training speed. Pretraining and posttraining peak tibial shock values for each limb were compared. Results Participants reduced peak tibial shock in the trained limb by 35% to 37% (P < 0.05, Cohen\u2019s d = 0.78\u20130.85), and in the untrained limb by 20% to 23% (P < 0.05, Cohen\u2019s d = 0.51\u20130.71) across the three testing speeds. The reduction was not significantly different between the trained and untrained limbs (P = 0.31\u20130.79, Cohen\u2019s d = 0.18\u20130.45). Similarly, there was no difference in peak tibial shock reduction among the three running speeds (P = 0.48\u20130.61, Cohen\u2019s d = 0.06\u20130.45).

Our design has three main components, two for computing the priors and likelihoods based on observations and one for apply- ing Bayes\u2019 rule.

We also provide a novel explanation of base-rate neglect, the most well-documented deviation from Bayes\u2019 rule, by modelling it as a weight decay mechanism which increases entropy. Keywords: Neural-network; Bayes\u2019 rule; Bayesian learning and inference; base-rate neglect; weight decay; entropy Introduction Bayesian models are becoming prominent across a wide range of problems in cognitive science including inductive learning (Tenenbaum, Kemp, & Shafto, 2006), language ac- quisition (Chater & Manning, 2006), and vision (Yuille & Kersten, 2006). While these Bayesian ideas provide compu- tation level models, it is beneficial, and sometimes necessary, to appeal to some implementation-level (biological) models to explain human behaviour. Connectionist approaches pro- vide a neural-based model of cognitive processes. There is growing evidence in neuroscience supporting the relevance of Bayesian models on a neural level (Doya, Ishii, Pouget, & Rao, 2007). Many perceptual and sensorimotor tasks that are learned and performed by the central nervous system can be described in a Bayesian framework (Konrad & Wolpert, 2004). Neural computations, as simple as summing up the firing rates, can be seen as analogous to a Bayesian inference process, with population activity patterns encoding posterior distributions (Pouget, Dayan, & Zemel, 2003). In theoretical terms, connectionist models show promis- ing prospects in implementing computational-level Bayesian ideas. Under certain assumptions, and inspired by the na- ture of neural activation functions, neural units can compute posterior probability values (McClelland, 1998). So-called Boltzmann machines, a type of stochastic recurrent neural network, were also suggested to implement Bayesian learn- ing (Ackley, Hinton, & Sejnowski, 1985). Later work intro- duced generative networks called restrictive Boltzmann ma- chines that can make bidirectional inferences based on what they learned (Hinton & Osindero, 2006). All these connections between Bayesian and neural- network models motivate further exploration of the relation between the two. In this paper, we propose a complete, mod- ular neural-network structure implementing Bayesian learn- ing and inference in a general form. We do this by using three main modules, two responsible for computing priors and like- lihoods based on observations, and one responsible for apply- ing Bayes rule and computing the posteriors. We show that our model is able to successfully implement Bayesian learn- ing and inference and replicate analytical results with high precision in a brain-like fashion which could later be used to gain intuition into how brains implement Bayesian reasoning. Our work also provides a framework to study the deviations from optimal Bayesian reasoning which result from base-rate neglect (Kahneman & Tversky, 1996; Eddy, 1982). Our work is novel in its precise and complete implementa- tion of a Bayesian framework in a modular, brain-like fash- ion. The proposed network takes observations as inputs and computes the posterior probabilities (i.e., updated be- liefs). Moreover, using a fast, constructive learning algorithm (sibling-descendent cascade-correlation) for the network pro- vides the advantage of a self-organizing learning and infer- ence method which is similar to humans\u2019 developmental, au- tonomous inference and learning (Shultz & Fahlman, 2010). Another novelty of this work is the modelling of base-rate neglect as a weight decay mechanism. The idea of neural implementation of Bayesian phenom- ena was suggested before. Shi and Griffiths (2009) intro- duced a scheme for implementing importance sampling with radial basis function (RBF) networks. They assume that the unit activation functions are of radial basis type. Hence, in their model, a single RBF neuron measures likelihood, result- ing in a straightforward implementation of importance sam- pling. Also, Griffiths et al. (2012) used a linear network to approximate the generalization performance of a probabilis- tic model. Their linear networks produce different solutions from Bayes on structures other than those based on Wishart priors. Our work differs in two major ways. First, we as- sume that the characteristics of the likelihood/priors and the network\u2019s structure are unknown a priori and learn them for a wide range of likelihood and prior distributions through a constructive training phase. Also, these functions are learned precisely (i.e., no approximation) using a population of neu- rons with simple though realistic activation functions (sig- moid) rather than linear or complex ones (RBF). The Basics of Bayesian Learning and Inference The Bayesian framework addresses the problem of updating beliefs and making inferences based on observed data.

But there are some shortcomings. Such as, only few kinds of solids can be reconstructed, the high complexity of time and less information about the 3D model. The research is extended and process card is treated as part of the 3D reconstruction. A set of process data is a superset of 2D engineering drawings set. The set comprises process drawings and process steps, and shows a sequencing and asymptotic course that a part is made from roughcast blank to final product. According to these characteristics, the object to be reconstructed is translated from the complicated engineering drawings into a series of much simpler process drawings. With the plentiful process information added for reconstruction, the disturbances such as irrelevant graph, symbol and label, etc. can be avoided. And more, the form change of both neighbor process drawings is so little that the engineering drawings interpretation has no difficulty; in addition, the abnormal solution and multi-solution can be avoided during reconstruction, and the problems of being applicable to more objects is solved ultimately. Therefore, the utility method for 3D reconstruction model will be possible. On the other hand, the feature information in process cards is provided for reconstruction model. Focusing on process cards, the feasibility and requirements of Working Procedure Model reconstruction is analyzed, and the method to apply and implement the Natural Language Understanding into the 3D reconstruction is studied. The method of asymptotic approximation product was proposed, by which a 3D process model can be constructed automatically and intelligently.

In contrast with empirical risk minimization (ERM) methods, which use convex surrogate losses to approximate the desired non-convex target loss function, adversarial methods minimize non-convex losses by treating the properties of the training data as being uncertain and worst case within a minimax game. Despite this difference in formulation, we recast adversarial classification under zero-one loss as an ERM method with a novel prescribed loss function. We demonstrate a number of theoretical and practical advantages over the very closely related hinge loss ERM methods. This establishes adversarial classification under the zero-one loss as a method that fills the long standing gap in multiclass hinge loss classification, simultaneously guaranteeing Fisher consistency and universal consistency, while also providing dual parameter sparsity and high accuracy predictions in practice.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "NIPS", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2549334782", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15348764", "86426456", "207165665", "206787478", "2833811", "14431545", "10151608", "15059183", "7087225", "18876084", "225244", "7330761", "19010748", "18236183", "219298", "436844", "2979587", "60518975", "7661463", "8907195", "1033682", "17808083", "17671150", "1115550"], "inbound_citations": ["89609080", "73728371", "9366388", "53232072", "39755600", "56177574"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10913546"}

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, being an activity of central nervous system, can reflect the underlying true emotional state of a person. This paper presents a computational framework for classifying PD patients compared to healthy controls (HC) using emotional information from the brain's electrical activity. Approach Emotional EEG data were obtained from 20 PD patients and 20 healthy age-, gender- and education level-matched controls by inducing the six basic emotions of happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise and disgust using multimodal (audio and visual) stimuli. In addition, participants were asked to report their subjective affect. Because of the nonlinear and dynamic nature of EEG signals, we utilized higher order spectral features (specifically, bispectrum) for analysis. Two different classifiers namely K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were used to investigate the performance of the HOS based features to classify each of the six emotional states of PD patients compared to HC. Ten-fold cross-validation method was used for testing the reliability of the classifier results. Main results From the experimental results with our EEG data set, we found that (a) classification performance of bispectrum features across ALL frequency bands is better than individual frequency bands in both the groups using SVM classifier; (b) higher frequency band plays a more important role in emotion activities than lower frequency band; and (c) PD patients showed emotional impairments compared to HC, as demonstrated by a lower classification performance, particularly for negative emotions (sadness, fear, anger and disgust). Significance These results demonstrate the effectiveness of applying EEG features with machine learning techniques to classify the each emotional state difference of PD patients compared to HC, and offer a promising approach for detection of emotional impairments associated with other neurological disorders.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.bspc.2014.07.005", "venue": "Biomed.

Especially, there is little experimental evaluation on the model's performance for different types of features. Fusion of multiple types of features is usually necessary in the scene classification due to the complexity of scene images. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of the LDA model in scene classification by using 7 types of features (i.e. uniform grid based interest points, Harris corner based interest points, scale invariant feature transform (SIFT), texture, shape, color, and location) and their various combinations. Furthermore, we compare the performance of the LDA model with Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. All experiments are performed on the UIUC Sport Scene database.

Full realisation of this potential requires robust algorithms that can extract the required ecosystem attributes from imagery. Woody cover is an indicative ecosystem state variable in savannah wilderness areas, whose extraction poses a challenge in reproducing the characteristically discontinuous cover. In this work the performance of the more modern, nonparametric regression tree and Random Forest classifiers in mapping savannah woody cover is compared with the parametric, potentially highly accurate sub-pixel classification approach. Detailed field quantification of % woody cover in 1 ha plots yielded data for the training stage of the two decision tree-based nonparametric classifiers. SPOT 6 NAOMI imagery whose timing excluded grass from the spectral signature of non-senescent vegetation was used. In order to improve the capability to extract woody cover the 6 m resolution of the multispectral bands was enhanced to 1.5 m, using high pass filter pan-sharpening. For the decision tree-based classifiers multiresolution image segmentation was then employed as preliminary step in extracting the woody cover. Objects approximating the 1 ha field plots were delineated at the coordinates of the respective field sampling sites. The univariate decision tree training stage used 60% of the sampling sites. The woody cover classes 0\u201319%, 20\u201339%, 40\u201359% and 60\u201379% were the labels of recursive partitioning terminal tree leaves. For Random Forest, up to 500 decision trees (Ntree) were specified. For regression tree modelling the 10-fold cross validation approach using the 1-SE rule was used for optimal tree selection, and pruning using 20% of the field sampling sites was accomplished using the cost complexity pruning technique. The remaining 20% of the field sampling sites were reserved for accuracy assessment, for which an additional stratified random sample of coordinates verified using a concurrent high resolution QuickBird image was used. Spectral signatures approximating Gaussian distributions were generated using woody end member sites for sub-pixel classification. Random Forest produced the highest overall accuracy (95.7%), followed by regression tree modelling (90.6%), and sub-pixel classification (73.3%). The two nonparametric classifiers correctly modelled the landscape distribution, occasional continuous formations and discontinuities in the woody cover.

Then, the Distributed Generator (DG) with the lowest amount of fundamental voltage, which is the closest one to the fault, injects an appropriate voltage/current harmonic. As the faulted section has the lowest impedance value from the Point of Common Coupling of the DG, the harmonic current of the corresponding line has the highest value. Based on this fact, the first candidate DG sends a notification signal to the second candidate DG, in which the fault occurs between them.

This is the most common leukemia, preferentially affecting people aged over 50 years old. It is incurable and in most cases shows no clinical signs. Thus, it is often discovered by chance during a blood test. If necessary, morphological and immunological studies are led by analyzing blood smears colored with May-Grunwald Giemsa, by making a complete blood count and by computing a Matutes scores. These studies are necessary because it is impossible to distinguish a healthy cell from a cancerous one only using a conventional microscope even if the cells are stained. In order to establish the diagnosis of the disease reliably and automatically, a new approach based on the Raman microspectroscopy is introduced in this study. Based on the interaction between matter and light, this technology acquires a real molecular and biochemical signature of the analyzed sample in a label-free manner (no staining or marking of the sample). Recently, Raman microspectroscopy has shown a promising potential to highlight the pathophysiological states in both human and animal since differences between different pathophysiological states occur at the molecular level. From unstained blood smears, obtained by spreading a drop of blood of CLL patients and healthy persons on standard glass slides, Raman spectra are acquired on the nucleus of white blood cells. Using a supervised classification algorithm such as the \u201cSupport Vector Machine\u201d (SVM), a spectral model is established to distinguish spectra obtained from healthy or pathological cells. This model is computed using a population of spectra called \u201ctraining set\u201d and consists of 513 spectra from 6 CLL patients and 347 spectra from 4 healthy persons. Then, a classification of the \u201cvalidation set\u201d composed of 2820 spectra from 33 CLL patients and 1074 spectra from13 healthy individuals was achieved. A sensitivity of 84.84% and a specificity of 84.61% were obtained on the patient. Finally, a \u201cblind set\u201d composed of 721 spectra from 8 cases is classified. The sensitivity and specificity are respectively equal to 80% and 100%. The results obtained on the differentiation between healthy and pathological cells show the real potential of Raman spectroscopy coupled with supervised classification for the diagnosis of CLL. Future studies will concentrate on the prognosis, and if possible the prediction of CLL. Citation Format: {Authors}. {Abstract title} [abstract].

In this paper, the classification of apoptosis proteins based on their subcellular localization is presented. Various composition based features and multiscale entropy-based features are extracted. Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA) is employed to select the features with high significance. Two well-known classifiers, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) are employed to classify the proteins from the reduced feature set.

In a previous study, we proposed a method for classifying lung tissue patterns using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), with an architecture designed for the specific problem. In this study, we present an improved method for training the proposed network by transferring knowledge from the similar domain of general texture classification. Six publicly available texture databases are used to pretrain networks with the proposed architecture, which are then fine-tuned on the lung tissue data. The resulting CNNs are combined in an ensemble and their fused knowledge is compressed back to a network with the original architecture. The proposed approach resulted in an absolute increase of about 2% in the performance of the proposed CNN.

First, the cellular image is given to the DCAE whose task is to reconstruct the original input image with an encodingdecoding scheme.

The second step consists of using these features as the inputs of a neural network based regressor whose outputs will represent the number of the cells in the image.

Most previous studies employ kernels or graphs to integrate different types of features, which routinely assume one weight for one type of features. However, for many problems, the importance of features in one source to an individual cluster of data can be varied, which makes the previous approaches ineffective. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view learning model to integrate all features and learn the weight for every feature with respect to each cluster individually via new joint structured sparsity-inducing norms. The proposed multi-view learning framework allows us not only to perform clustering tasks, but also to deal with classification tasks by an extension when the labeling knowledge is available. A new efficient algorithm is derived to solve the formulated objective with rigorous theoretical proof on its convergence. We applied our new data fusion method to five broadly used multi-view data sets for both clustering and classification. In all experimental results, our method clearly outperforms other related state-of-the-art methods.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ICML", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2105709960", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["623918", "16902615", "14079018", "478020", "13558581", "6901292", "8087541", "1452577", "5841767", "18764978", "2907653", "6998485", "12360898", "53940663", "1793044", "1296677", "7151168", "14494691", "2366213", "617020", "6162124"], "inbound_citations": ["204899999", "21683810", "30036424", "202701154", "23231232", "9335134", "204812588", "10845383", "5226376", "15888544", "1732598", "34182307", "6397880", "9088787", "53015088", "8411963", "33176941", "51610961", "3307435", "198179469", "2303734", "81981212", "15441229", "12571832", "16181124", "35352050", "196654023", "52277223", "13803189", "3446563", "3630430", "14654476", "26132976", "44064257", "18566716", "7065157", "24516246", "3489845", "51604787", "202679361", "4565032", "5671429", "46927436", "207017", "1346117", "14006456", "7623874", "21500985", "467106", "59206097", "51711324", "23484091", "211475950", "52302216", "51612522", "215144758", "5288540", "4379370", "51615440", "4803701", "43297286", "53159446", "15193538", "19321645", "36979319", "195823899", "51954746", "1034305", "152282933", "14138494", "10483060", "8411254", "44008632", "133608068", "11806775", "214599820", "44070833", "4554078", "10139588", "145822735", "14926665", "8061590", "1319572", "7135597", "212731966", "69315011", "199488287", "46928730", "9393466", "51944788", "13618448", "293923", "199552279", "42031762", "54445135", "24113190", "2337800", "208883745", "209696429", "207898115", "53082760", "59232067", "13953711", "6949699", "202750233", "51891003", "10707042", "27774326", "36690661", "14378357", "34115570", "4539626", "49549964", "23565", "27900697", "3464412", "4688059", "46958489", "51771734", "56718293", "77382801", "1598166", "169037305", "51615991", "73700145", "3707395", "18398732", "14855641", "35166483", "210845633", "49408192", "51881909", "11282545", "16779310", "201138314", "18013712", "57362988", "149806905", "6127628", "3233637", "20615492", "18289130", "4646590", "198171675", "52072283", "17191847", "8510999", "4779811", "69934548"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17861781"}

They can be used to solve inverse problems as well as for data classification and clustering. The first applications of machine learning methods to remote sensing problems were mainly aimed at tasks such as land use classification , identification of specific objects (e.g. clouds) in satellite imagery, and atmospheric profiling. In the last decade, these methods have started to receive attention in the aerosol and cloud remote sensing community as tools to speed up the retrieval of aerosol and cloud properties. Machine learning methods can enter the processing chain of a remote sensing product in several ways. They have been used as stand-alone retrieval or classification algorithms, as fast approximate forward models or as part of a more complex type of algorithm. In this paper we review examples of use of machine learning techniques in the three ways mentioned above.

Motivated by the upcoming issues associated with data stream applications, such as concept drift and the velocity into which data needs to be processed, several methods have been proposed in the literature, most of them resulting from adaptations of traditional algorithms. Such methods are forced to satisfy hard requirements of restricted memory and processing time, while keeping track of the performance at the same time. In the classification context, ensembles are an effective and elegant way to handle this task. And mostly, the bottleneck of processing time and memory of an ensemble relies on the employed base learner and on the ensemble updating policy. This paper addresses both issues by proposing: 1) a fast base learning algorithm, which relies on discretizing every attribute range into disjoint intervals and associating, to each of them, a posterior probability relating it to a class; and 2) a static ensemble that comprises such base learners and handles concept drift without replacing base learners.

A stability criterion based on Lyapunov approach is used to prove both asymptotic stability of estimation error and stability in the estimated parameters suitable for identification of nonlinear dynamic systems. The developed algorithm not only guarantees stability, but also reduces the computational demand compared to the OS-ELM approach based on recursive least squares. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on a real-world scenario, an advanced combustion engine identification problem is considered. The algorithm is applied to two case studies: An online regression learning for system identification of a Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) Engine and an online classification learning (with class imbalance) for identifying the dynamic operating envelope of the HCCI Engine.

However, CTA is prone to artifacts that reduce the diagnostic accuracy to identify stenoses. Further, CTA does not allow for determination of the physiologic significance of the visualized stenoses. In this paper, we propose a new system to determine the physiologic manifestation of coronary stenoses by assessment of myocardial perfusion from typically acquired CTA images at rest. As a first step, we develop an automated segmentation method to delineate the left ventricle. Both endocardium and epicardium are compactly modeled with subdivision surfaces and coupled by explicit thickness representation. After initialization with five anatomical landmarks, the model is adapted to a target image by deformation increments including control vertex displacements and thickness variations guided by trained AdaBoost classifiers, and regularized by a prior of deformation increments from principal component analysis (PCA). The evaluation using a 5-fold cross-validation demonstrates the overall segmentation error to be 1.00 \u00b1 0.39 mm for endocardium and 1.06 \u00b1 0.43 mm for epicardium, with a boundary contour alignment error of 2.79 \u00b1 0.52. Based on our LV model, two types of myocardial perfusion analyzes have been performed. One is a perfusion network analysis, which explores the correlation (as network edges) pattern of perfusion between all pairs of myocardial segments (as network nodes) defined in AHA 17-segment model. We find perfusion network display different patterns in the normal and disease groups, as divided by whether significant coronary stenosis is present in quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). The other analysis is a clinical validation assessment of the ability of the developed algorithm to predict whether a patient has significant coronary stenosis when referenced to an invasive QCA ground truth standard. By training three machine learning techniques using three features of normalized perfusion intensity, transmural perfusion ratio, and myocardial wall thickness, we demonstrate AdaBoost to be slightly better than Naive Bayes and Random Forest by the area under receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. For the AdaBoost algorithm, an optimal cut-point reveals an accuracy of 0.70, with sensitivity and specificity of 0.79 and 0.64, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a novel deep-learning based method to allow fast removal of reflection. Similar to the traditional multiple-image approaches, the proposed algorithm first captures the multi-view images of a scene. Then the images are fed to a convolutional neural network to obtain the depth information along the edges of the image. It is sent to a Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGAN) for estimating the edges of the background. Finally, the background edges are used in another WGAN to reconstruct the background image.

How a TF can bind to the genome in such a highly cell-type specific manner, is a critical research question. One hypothesis is that a TF requires co-binding of different TFs in different cell types. If this is the case, it may be possible to observe different combinations of TF motifs \u2013 a motif grammar \u2013 located at the TF binding sites in different cell types. In this study, we develop a bioinformatics method to systematically identify DNA motifs in TF binding sites across multiple cell types based on published ChIP-seq data, and address two questions: (1) can we build a machine learning classifier to predict cell-type specificity based on motif combinations alone, and (2) can we extract meaningful cell-type specific motif grammars from this classifier model.ResultsWe present a Random Forest (RF) based approach to build a multi-class classifier to predict the cell-type specificity of a TF binding site given its motif content. We applied this RF classifier to two published ChIP-seq datasets of TF (TCF7L2 and MAX) across multiple cell types. Using cross-validation, we show that motif combinations alone are indeed predictive of cell types. Furthermore, we present a rule mining approach to extract the most discriminatory rules in the RF classifier, thus allowing us to discover the underlying cell-type specific motif grammar.ConclusionsOur bioinformatics analysis supports the hypothesis that combinatorial TF motif patterns are cell-type specific.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5780765", "pubmed_id": "29363433", "doi": "10.1186/s12864-017-4340-z", "venue": "BMC Genomics", "journal": "BMC Genomics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2783189800", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["205485256", "1768190", "34606964", "4456596", "4371494", "9281466", "8975192", "4406987", "14865914", "11008169", "9747567", "45877627", "8639723", "17674302", "10417280", "16329411", "2488082", "804410", "3204652", "31039418", "206420153", "15245447", "11811874", "26026616", "14310042", "10112299", "6095721", "5709823", "27575991", "22693398", "1448644", "208546243", "13519235", "25360740", "20605595", "749967", "12019872", "11741203", "23524863", "26596257", "3451637", "21256356", "40971758", "9613437", "43402690", "9053253", "15966253", "205314734", "18020988", "35560516", "7765120", "3093707", "17166335", "34358998", "39717245", "14014351", "2857976", "3088733", "17409674", "9809764"], "inbound_citations": ["215507217", "158047321", "202624907", "5984185", "209449624", "211244406", "6280148", "196577746"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12563176"}

We propose a technique to predict refactoring candidates based on the application of a machine learning based framework. We use Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVM) as the learning algorithm, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a feature extraction technique and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) as a technique for handling imbalanced data. We start with 102 source code metrics as input features which are then reduced to 31 features after removing irrelevant and redundant features through statistical tests. We conduct a series of experiments on publicly available software engineering dataset consisting of seven open-source software systems in which the refactored classes are manually validated. We apply LS-SVM with three different functions: linear, polynomial and Radial Basis Function (RBF). Statistical significance test demonstrate that RBF kernel outperforms linear and polynomial kernel but there is no statistically significant difference between the performance of linear and polynomial kernel. Statistical significance test reveals that with-SMOTE technique outperforms without-SMOTE and all metrics outperforms PCA based metrics.

In our model, each GP chromosome is a tree that encodes the mathematical expression of a multiple kernel.

The numerical experiments show that the SVM involving the evolutionary complex multiple kernels perform better than the classic simple kernels.

The traditional extreme learning machine has significant disadvantages, including slow training, difficulty in selecting parameters, and difficulty in setting the singularity and the data sample. A prediction model of an improved Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (IOS-ELM) of daily reference crop evapotranspiration is therefore examined in this paper. The different manipulation of the inverse of the matrix is made according to the optimal solution and using a regularization factor at the same time in the model. The flexibility of the IOS-ELM in ET0 modeling was assessed using the original meteorological data (Tmax, Tm, Tmin, n, Uh, RHm, \u03c6, Z) of the years 1971\u20132014 in Yulin, Ankang, Hanzhong, and Xi\u2019an of Shaanxi, China. Those eight parameters were used as the input, while the reference evapotranspiration values were the output. In addition, the ELM, LSSVM, Hargreaves, Priestley-Taylor, Mc Cloud and IOS-ELM models were tested against the FAO- 56 PM model by the performance criteria. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance of IOS-ELM was better than the ELM and LSSVM and significantly better than the other empirical models. Furthermore, when the total ET0 estimation of the models was compared by the relative error, the results of the intelligent algorithms were better than empirical models at rates lower than 5%, but the gross ET0 empirical models mainly had 12% to 64.60% relative error. This research could provide a reference to accurate ET0 estimation by meteorological data and give accurate predictions of crop water requirements, resulting in intelligent irrigation decisions in Shaanxi.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.24850/j-tyca-2017-02-12", "venue": null, "journal": "Tecnologia y Ciencias del Agua", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2735635716", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["210624241", "97547106", "33124388", "131358115", "128588132", "34017305", "108950046", "22279655", "6350628", "130802576", "10923692", "55298155"], "inbound_citations": ["85443512"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55014600"}

A number of centralized attack detection mechanisms have been proposed to detect attacks in IoT, wherein an attack detection system is deployed at the central point in the network that collects data from the network and classifies it as \u201cattack\u201d or \u201cnormal\u201d using a supervised machine learning algorithm. Note, however, that these mechanisms have failed to achieve significant results due to the distinct requirements of IoT devices, such as scalability, distribution, resource limitations, and low latency. Moreover, the application of supervised machine learning for classification needs a significant amount of labeled data. In this paper, we introduce a fog-based attack detection framework that relies on the fog computing paradigm and a newly proposed ELM-based Semi-supervised Fuzzy C-Means (ESFCM) method. As an extension of cloud computing, fog computing enables attack detection at the network edge and supports distributed attack detection. The ESFCM method uses a semi-supervised fuzzy c-means algorithm to handle the labeled data issue and an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm to provide good generalization performance at a faster detection rate. The evaluation was performed on the NSL-KDD dataset, demonstrating that the proposed framework achieved better performance than the centralized attack detection framework.

From the real-data experiment, we conclude that: (i) The ensemble classifier XGBoost produces the best performance with an accuracy of 92.70%; (ii) The group of DSSDF plays an important role in identifying MDRT with an accuracy improvement of 11.2% (using XGBoost). The proposed approach has been applied in capacity utilization optimization and new driver training for the Baoshen Railway.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/ijgi7080308", "venue": "ISPRS Int.

We now investigate an algorithm-derived comprehensive list of genes encoding proteins that directly interact with GSK3&bgr; to identify a genotypic network influencing hippocampal volume in MDD. Participants and methods We used discovery (N=141) and replication (N=77) recurrent MDD samples. Our gene list was generated from the NetworKIN database. Hippocampal measures were derived using an optimized Freesurfer protocol. We identified interacting single nucleotide polymorphisms using the machine learning algorithm Random Forest and verified interactions using likelihood ratio tests between nested linear regression models. Results The discovery sample showed multiple two-single nucleotide polymorphism interactions with hippocampal volume.

This paper presents a solution which has been guided by psychological and mathematical results. The method is based on a distributed concept description which is composed of a set of weighted, symbolic characterizations. Two learning processes incrementally modify this description. One adjusts the characterization weights and another creates new characterizations. The latter process is described in terms of a search through the space of possibilities and is shown to require linear space with respect to the number of attribute-value pairs in the description language. The method utilizes previously acquired concept definitions in subsequent learning by adding an attribute for each learned concept to instance descriptions. A program called STAGGER fully embodies this method, and this paper reports on a number of empirical analyses of its performance. Since understanding the relationships between a new learning method and existing ones can be difficult, this paper first reviews a framework for discussing machine learning systems and then describes STAGGER in that framework.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1023/A:1022810614389", "venue": "Machine Learning", "journal": "Machine Learning", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1999038366", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["38895043", "109234868", "10014565", "62442848", "62699299", "43804729", "59989691", "61406953", "16328360", "61536073", "60734142", "13252401", "14885825", "16642894", "145456783", "144952337", "144965702"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:43746986"}

Here, we address the design of performance metrics for models that aim to predict neural responses to sensory inputs. This is particularly difficult because the responses of sensory neurons are inherently variable, even in response to repeated presentations of identical stimuli. In this situation, standard metrics (such as correlation coefficient) fail because they do not distinguish between explainable variance (the part of the neural response that is systematically dependent on the stimulus) and response variability (the part of the neural response that is not systematically dependent on the stimulus, and cannot be explained by modeling the stimulus-response relationship). As a result, models which perfectly describe the systematic stimulus-response relationship may appear to perform poorly. Two metrics have previously been proposed which account for this inherent variability: Signal Power Explained (SPE), and the normalized correlation coefficient (CCnorm). Here, we analyze these metrics, and show that they are intimately related. However, SPE has no lower bound, and we show that, even for good models, SPE can yield negative values that are difficult to interpret. CCnorm is better behaved in that it is effectively bounded between -1 and 1, and values below zero are very rare in practice and easy to interpret. However, it was hitherto not possible to calculate CCnorm directly; instead, it was estimated using imprecise and laborious resampling techniques. Here, we identify a new approach that can calculate CCnorm quickly and accurately. As a result, we argue that it is now a better choice of metric than SPE to accurately evaluate the performance of neural models.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4748266", "pubmed_id": "26903851", "doi": "10.3389/fncom.2016.00010", "venue": "Front.

Real-time power optimization is crucial to the system performance. Even though individual real-time optimization methods exist, literature rarely investigate comparison of different real-time power optimization methods. This paper first time compares three real-time implementable power optimization methods for an organic Rankine cycle waste heat recovery system. Three optimization methods include Proportional-Integral-Derivative rule-based method, nonlinear model predictive control and dynamic programming. In the Proportional-Integral-Derivative rule-based method, rule-based method defines the optimal working fluid vapor temperature trajectory and Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller manipulates the pump speed to follow that trajectory. In the nonlinear model predictive control method, reference vapor temperature is defined close to the saturation temperature and then the model predictive control minimizes the vapor temperature tracking error by controlling the pump speed. In the Dynamic Programming method, the net power produced by the organic Rankine cycle system is defined in the cost function, which is maximized by controlling the pump speed. A Random Forest machine learning model is utilized to extract the rules for Dynamic Programming and then implemented in real-time. All the three methods are implemented in the same experimentally validated plant model for the comparison analysis. The comparison results show that the Dynamic Programming Random Forest method has similar performance with nonlinear model predictive control method and outperforms the Proportional-Integral-Derivative rule-based method by 9.9% in net power production. Dynamic Programming Random Forest method can be an alternative to the nonlinear model predictive control for its low computation cost and high net power production.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2019.114442", "venue": null, "journal": "Applied Thermal Engineering", "mag_id": "2976760890", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["212715822", "208843391"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204170402"}

Our IALVQ method updates the prototypes (parameters of classifier) incrementally to adapt to drifted concepts globally while utilize the style consistency locally.

Tests were conducted to establish the best polynomial and Gaussian RBF (radial basis function) kernels. As it is well known that SVMs are sensitive to the number of features in pattern classification applications, the performance of the SVMs as a function of the number and type of features was also studied. Our goal here, in feature selection is to obtain a smaller set of features that accurately represent the original set. A K-fold cross validation procedure with three subsets was applied to assure reliability. In a kernel optimization experiment using nine popular shape features (area, bounding box ratio, major axis length, minor axis length, eccentricity, equivalent diameter, extent, roundness and convex perimeter), a classification rate of 95% was achieved using a polynomial kernel with degree six, and a classification rate of 90% was achieved using a RBF kernel with 27 sigma.

Using the optimal feature set, comprised of bounding box ratio, major axis length, extent and roundness, resulted in a classification rate of 96.25% using a polynomial kernel with degree of nine.

They are usually carried out in settings where the structure of the network under consideration is known. Motivated by real-world prob- lems, this study presents several algorithms for scenarios where the network structure is partially or completely unknown. The objective of network representation learning is to identify a mapping function that projects sparse and high-dimensional network graphs into a dense latent representation, which preserves the original information about nodes and their neighborhoods. The notion of neighborhood, however, be- comes illusive when the network structure is partially or completely hidden. ::: Inspired by previous results, in our thesis work we have developed novel algorithms that are resilient to such lack of knowledge. These results estab- lish a correlation between the properties of the network and different kind of node activities performed over it, information which is generally more available and can be easily observed. In particular, we focus on diffusion events \u2013 also called cascades \u2013 such as shares, retweets and hashtags. ::: In the first of our contributions, we have developed a novel NRL algorithm called Mineral, a simple technique that combines the observed cascades with the partially accessible network structure by sampling artificial cas- cades. Node representation is then learned from the observed and sampled cascades by using the SkipGram model that is widely used for word representation learning in natural language documents. ::: In our second contribution, called NetTensor, we assume that the network structure is completely hidden and we propose novel techniques that are capable to estimate both the hidden neighborhood (proximity) and the similarity of nodes. Such estimated values are then used to learn a unified embedding of nodes using a scalable truncated singular value decomposition and deep autoencoders. ::: In addition to the NRL algorithms, we have also proposed a novel CRL algorithm called cas2vec for virality (popularity) prediction. Again, we pursue a network-agnostic approach following the above assumption that the network structure is completely unknown. Unlike prior studies that rely on manual feature extraction, cas2vec automatically learns cascade representations based on convolutional neural networks, that are effective in predicting virality of cascades. ::: We have carried out extensive experiments using several real-world datasets for all of our methods and compared them against strong baselines from the state-of-the-art, achieving significantly better results than many of them.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2962793312", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199582659"}

The work wants to propose a non-linear and multivariate computational approach to predict soil textural data and surficial stoniness based on \u03b3-spectroscopy. The \u03b3-spectroscopy survey was performed in heterogeneous soils in terms of parent material, pedogenesis, morphology, coarse material and moisture content. The \u03b3-radiometrics survey was performed by \u201cThe Mole\u201d sensor (The Netherlands) and \u03b3-ray spectra were analysed by a Full Spectrum Analysis. 70 experimental points were described and classified according to parent material and surficial stoniness. The 70 experimental sites were also sampled during the \u03b3-ray survey and analysed for soil texture and moisture content. An explorative PCA in the experimental points, based on the \u03b3-ray data and the elevation, showed 3 groups of cases, relating to the three groups of bedrock (i) calcareous flysch, (ii) feldspathic sandstone, and (iii) other lithologies, namely marly-shales, marine and fluvio-lacustrine deposits. Two machine learning models were used to predict sand, clay and surficial stoniness. The models were Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). An independent validation set of 20 soil samples was used to check the accuracy of the prediction models. Both SVM and ANN showed good prediction accuracy for sand and clay, although SVM showed the lowest errors. Both models showed lower accuracy for stoniness prediction, mainly due to high prediction errors in several sampling points. Probably, the high errors in stoniness prediction were due the strong heterogeneity of rock types and mineralogy. However, prediction model of stoniness spatial variability is very important in order to an adequate farming management.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.geoderma.2014.03.012", "venue": null, "journal": "Geoderma", "mag_id": "2079042300", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["17089006", "55600007", "57758298", "133274367", "35011798", "204961231"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:129044875"}

It is found that the line saturability decays exponentially with the increase of line length. Secondly, to detect the geographical community structure of shipping lines, the Label Propagation Algorithm with compression of Flow (LPAF) and Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) method are employed, which show rather consistent communities. Lastly, to analyse the redundancy property of shipping lines of different marine companies, the multilayer networks were constructed by aggregating the shipping lines of different marine companies. It is observed that the topological quantities, such as average degree, average clustering coefficient, etc., increase smoothly when marine companies are randomly merged (randomly choose two marine companies, then merge the shipping lines of them together), while the relative entropy decreases when the merging sequence is determined by the Jensen-Shannon distance (choose two marine companies when the J-S distance between them is the lowest).

The runtime process is further decomposed into three phases: startup, stable operation and shutdown. The measured data shows that the length of runtime in each cycle remains constant but idle time varies from cycle to cycle responding to outdoor environmental conditions. Four Data Mining Algorithms (DMAs) including k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are used to analyze the relationship between cycle idle time and weather conditions based on actual minute-by-minute electricity usage data of two furnaces in a residential house and weather data from the near-by weather station for a period of four months (January to April 2011). The obtained results show that SVM and ANN provide more accurate predictions of idle time. Parametric correlation analysis indicates that indoor\u2013outdoor temperature difference and wind speed are two key parameters affecting cycle idle time.

In particular, we have focused on learning to recognize instances of the protein-localization relationship in Medline s. We view the problem as a machine-learning task: given positive and negative extractions from a training corpus of abstracts, learn a logical theory that performs well on a held-aside testing set.

We propose Gleaner, a randomized search method which collects good clauses from a broad spectrum of points along the recall dimension in recall-precision curves and employs an at least N of these M clauses thresholding method to combine the selected clauses. We compare Gleaner to ensembles of standard Aleph theories and find that Gleaner produces comparable testset results in a fraction of the training time needed for ensembles.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-540-30109-7_11", "venue": "Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2597345021,32160621", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2005360", "16024735", "2428831", "207738357", "13225477", "489775", "873512", "15703572", "17531530", "18728840", "10817004", "13325475", "207927251", "11123158", "10437060", "57223098", "14289503", "431089", "15680189", "15544052", "3245543"], "inbound_citations": ["206407526", "13662515", "9531857", "207472713", "12573523", "6113360", "22767847", "201225356", "2538168", "65888", "18414041", "61180702", "16703952", "17387635", "800937", "2027435", "53532409", "16326230", "215662166", "207159665", "5924544", "15892104", "7513745", "63399537", "8856378", "10800602", "8167339", "5558082", "18803084", "8606445", "14945660", "14237631", "11178057", "1526216", "16813217", "212412160", "107265596", "578710", "838228", "133608100", "211075908", "5683387", "214928252", "207780210", "27293359"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15030110"}

It consists of two parts: regularization error and sample error. While many techniques are available for treating the sample error, much less is known for the regularization error and the corresponding approximation error for reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We are mainly concerned about the regularization error. It is estimated for general distributions by a K-functional in weighted Lq spaces. For weakly separable distributions (i.e., the margin may be zero) satisfactory convergence rates are provided by means of separating functions. A projection operator is introduced, which leads to better sample error estimates especially for small complexity kernels. The misclassification error is bounded by the V-risk associated with a general class of loss functions V. The difficulty of bounding the offset is overcome. Polynomial kernels and Gaussian kernels are used to demonstrate the main results.

In this study, for the first time, the groundwater level (GWL) of the Sarab Qanbar well located in the south of Kermanshah, Iran, is approximated using the wavelet\u2013SAELM model. An artificial intelligence method called \u201cself-adaptive extreme learning machine (SAELM)\u201d and the \u201cwavelet transform\u201d method were implemented to develop a predictive model. First, using the autocorrelation function (ACF) and the partial autocorrelation function (PACF), the effective lags in estimating the GWL were detected and evaluated. Then, eight distinctive SAELM and WA\u2013SAELM models were developed using the input combinations selected by the ACF and the PACF as different lags. Later, the values of the observational well were normalized to estimate the GWL. Time series data were divided into two subsamples including 70% to train the artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and 30% to test the AI models. Next, the most optimized mother wavelet was chosen for the modeling. By evaluating the results of the SAELM and WA\u2013SAELM models, it was concluded that compared to the SAELM models, the WA\u2013SAELM models estimate values of the objective function with higher accuracy. Then, the superior model was introduced, which was very accurate in forecasting the GWL.

However, wind power has the characteristics of intermittency and volatility, so its penetration into electric power systems brings challenges for their safe and stable operation, therefore making accurate wind power forecasting increasingly important, which is also a challenging task. In this paper, a new hybrid wind power forecasting method, named the BND-ALO-RVM forecaster, is proposed. It combines the Beveridge-Nelson decomposition method (BND), relevance vector machine (RVM) and ant lion optimizer (ALO). Considering the nonlinear and non-stationary characteristics of wind power data, the wind power time series were firstly decomposed into deterministic, cyclical and stochastic components using BND. Then, these three decomposed components were respectively forecasted using RVM. Meanwhile, to improve the forecasting performance, the kernel width parameter of RVM was optimally determined by ALO, a new Nature-inspired meta-heuristic algorithm. Finally, the wind power forecasting result was obtained by multiplying the forecasting results of those three components. The proposed BND-ALO-RVM wind power forecaster was tested with real-world hourly wind power data from the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region in China. To verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed forecaster, it was compared with single RVM without time series decomposition and parameter optimization, RVM with time series decomposition based on BND (BND-RVM), RVM with parameter optimization (ALO-RVM), and Generalized Regression Neural Network with data decomposition based on Wavelet Transform (WT-GRNN) using three forecasting performance criteria, namely MAE (Mean Absolute Error), MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).

The discriminative model is a Random Forest classifier trained to detect the brain boundary; the generative model is a point distribution model that ensures that the result is plausible. When a new image is presented to the system, the generative model is explored to find the contour with highest likelihood according to the discriminative model. Because the target shape is in general not perfectly represented by the generative model, the contour is refined using graph cuts to obtain the final segmentation. Both models were trained using 92 scans from a proprietary dataset but they achieve a high degree of robustness on a variety of other datasets. ROBEX was compared with six other popular, publicly available methods (BET, BSE, FreeSurfer, AFNI, BridgeBurner, and GCUT) on three publicly available datasets (IBSR, LPBA40, and OASIS, 137 scans in total) that include a wide range of acquisition hardware and a highly variable population (different age groups, healthy/diseased). The results show that ROBEX provides significantly improved performance measures for almost every method/dataset combination.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "21880566", "doi": "10.1109/TMI.2011.2138152", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2145661921", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["209661", "17699151", "17567554", "16691577", "115691220", "54432685", "42165565", "18049861", "258503", "16210141", "24982557", "36010475", "9758832", "4254069", "8171620", "63717849", "89141", "4806326", "15850341", "2271742", "15619865", "9520602", "9481002", "207738357", "2995286", "8529157", "12795832", "9361554", "7900561", "3938756", "21167006", "122497171", "122725444", "16952215", "120450249", "36955056", "5377257", "43620802", "9333937"], "inbound_citations": ["33017053", "17296818", "167221304", "141501214", "54221875", "57241175", "8933726", "18459228", "22122862", "214971644", "209433313", "16026585", "19956223", "12466263", "8980363", "215150464", "204009031", "60442029", "19174296", "3751798", "1941712", "22701185", "612997", "49660939", "4457502", "4513154", "201626721", "3673340", "213257604", "1906899", "8519701", "27606743", "44083283", "52890433", "214624672", "213375900", "11759562", "8503329", "2918881", "23343865", "2996345", "14346125", "21987520", "13846218", "11448912", "17986273", "20986704", "207889036", "142792", "30461557", "1760092", "58014188", "38514311", "25012095", "24432307", "16179353", "2045019", "1919992", "890872", "3496250", "63009", "3932420", "4792240", "2262752", "11191484", "91089624", "22247247", "16620705", "89620774", "45066790", "53782259", "10994167", "9886163", "13750146", "4873311", "44107693", "8648508", "215597704", "53213350", "49314110", "211057712", "215353747", "13653019", "214946746", "192148", "38190799", "13320818", "209493659", "16437349", "196673517", "14437368", "51719291", "6516332", "208879512", "215151674", "18561613", "16737793", "91599113", "210718894", "45584572", "4393763", "215686639", "37937769", "214705206", "214705206", "214705206", "52055601", "8844977", "4578542", "21620838", "123498662", "52102388", "73555413", "195978909", "155093071", "133257780", "17629440", "14756243", "4783864", "36982417", "52077742", "214892507", "52843370", "54473002", "29737621", "18429225", "11597466", "207974144", "15453694", "3846068", "199474216", "4630694", "109762939", "167219453", "29169232", "38382144", "8448368", "210925977", "61986558", "61986558", "1031319", "7538198", "4637531", "139107846", "214678965", "12984725", "16723466", "22723179", "148067", "189813144", "10225975", "210116818", "90474256", "208268287", "58020058", "3872308", "215598101", "8297933", "59523686", "59523686", "1291200", "51982242", "13338160", "23419941", "12918427", "54444471", "49348415", "86760203", "59843110", "56248185", "3263846", "6970374", "10894953", "4775854", "37099732", "202764641", "11507077", "208604298", "196632907", "64003659", "4388635", "10787720", "78407052", "36924806", "2442392", "2442392", "215074316", "215271765", "53564690", "203654304", "11446019", "20025294", "53064907", "5046253", "5046987", "62114792", "214848704", "53045058", "199488246", "44116864", "2404393", "195785248", "215238347", "10367079", "13971121", "62144004", "173993998", "204852008", "50786007", "52008517", "12131125", "11132690", "56459328", "1845856"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16003169"}

A large amount of image corner points are the intersecting points of the edges of polygons. A corner point extracting method based on support vector for regression(SVR) was proposed aimed at extracting intersecting points. First, a digital image of geometric figures was collected with JAI CV-M4+CL array CCD device under natural lighting, and was transmitted into computer by image grabbing card X64-CLiProTM. Second, the original grey level image with noise was changed into edge information with single-pixel width after it was processed by noise reduction with edge-keeping filter, and then was edge detected with Canny operator and the contour was extracted. Third, regression function of each detected straight segment was obtained by training the SVR with the training point set, which had sub-pixel accuracy. The intersecting points of corresponding straight segments, which are exactly the under-detected corner points, were obtained by simple math works. Experimental results show that the proposed method for corner point extracting has a high accuracy and stability, and a strong robustness.

Models are being sought at different scales of biological organisation namely: sub-cellular, cellular, tissue, organ, organism and ecosystem; with a view of identifying how different components are connected together, how they are controlled and how they behave when functioning as a system. Except for very simple biological processes, system identification from first principles can be extremely difficult. This has brought into focus automated techniques for constructing models using data of system behaviour. Such techniques face three principal issues: (1) The model representation language must be rich enough to capture system behaviour; (2) The system identification technique must be powerful enough to identify substantially complex models; and (3) There may not be sufficient data to obtain both the model's structure and precise estimates of all of its parameters. In this paper, we address these issues in the following ways: (1) Models are represented in an expressive subset of first-order logic. Specifically, they are expressed as logic programs; (2) System identification is done using techniques developed in Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). This allows the identification of first-order logic models from data. Specifically, we employ an incremental approach in which increasingly complex models are constructed from simpler ones using snapshots of system behaviour; and (3) We restrict ourselves to \"qualitative\" models. These are non-parametric: thus, usually less data are required than for identifying parametric quantitative models. A further advantage is that the data need not be precise numerical observations (instead, they are abstractions like positive, negative, zero, increasing, decreasing and so on). We describe incremental construction of qualitative models using a simple physical system and demonstrate its application to identification of models at four scales of biological organisation, namely: (a) a predator-prey model at the ecosystem level; (b) a model for the human lung at the organ level; (c) a model for regulation of glucose by insulin in the human body at the extra-cellular level; and (d) a model for the glycolysis metabolic pathway at the cellular level.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/1390681.1442781", "venue": "J.

Storing user embeddings locally not only preserves user privacy, but also improves memory locality of personalization compared to on-server training. We evaluate FURL on two datasets, demonstrating a significant improvement in model quality with 8% and 51% performance increases, and approximately the same level of performance as centralized training with only 0% and 4% reductions.

Although numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of merging two information sources rather than using separate sources, approaches that simultaneously consider the local radar reflectivity, the neighborhood rain gauge observations, and the temporal information are much less common. In this paper, we present a new framework for real-time quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE). By formulating the QPE as a continuous conditional random field (CCRF) learning problem, the spatiotemporal correlations of precipitation can be explored more thoroughly. Based on the CCRF, we further improve the accuracy of the precipitation estimation by introducing geographical and temporal attention.

Second, the temporal attention penalizes the similarity between two adjacent timestamps via the discrepancy of two-view estimates, which can model the local temporal consistency and tolerate some drastic changes.

Two trials were conducted to evaluate different aspects of the classification scheme. In the first trial, the classifier was trained and evaluated by using a dataset of 420 samples collected from seven subjects by using a k-fold cross-validation method. The parameters \u03c3 and c of the RBF kernel were optimized through automatic searching in terms of yielding the highest recognition accuracy and robustness. In the second trial, the generation capability of the classifier was also validated by using the dataset collected from six new subjects. The average classification rates of 95% and 93% are obtained in trials 1 and 2, respectively. The results in trial 2 show the system is also good at classifying activity signals of new subjects.

In this work, we show that obtaining gradient information of the smoothed Wasserstein GAN formulation, which is based on regularized Optimal Transport (OT), is computationally effortless and hence one can apply first order optimization methods to minimize this objective.

We posit that this is because a one-size-fits-all machine learning model is inherently ill-suited to predicting outcomes like mood and stress, which vary greatly due to individual differences. Therefore, we employ Multitask Learning (MTL) techniques to train personalized ML models which are customized to the needs of each individual, but still leverage data from across the population. Three formulations of MTL are compared: i) MTL deep neural networks, which share several hidden layers but have final layers unique to each task; ii) Multi-task Multi-Kernel learning, which feeds information across tasks through kernel weights on feature types; and iii) a Hierarchical Bayesian model in which tasks share a common Dirichlet Process prior.

Some of the techniques that are being used to achieve privacy are to remove identifiers, alter quasi-identifiers, and perturb values. Unfortunately, these approaches suffer from two limitations. First, it has been shown that private information can still be leaked if attackers possess some background knowledge or other information sources. Second, they do not take into account the adverse impact these methods will have on the utility of the released data. In this paper, we propose a method that meets both requirements. Our method, called table-GAN, uses generative adversarial networks (GANs) to synthesize fake tables that are statistically similar to the original table yet do not incur information leakage. We show that the machine learning models trained using our synthetic tables exhibit performance that is similar to that of models trained using the original table for unknown testing cases. We call this property model compatibility. We believe that anonymization/perturbation/synthesis methods without model compatibility are of little value. We used four real-world datasets from four different domains for our experiments and conducted indepth comparisons with state-of-the-art anonymization, perturbation, and generation techniques.

Hand gesture recognition is one such domain which has a number of applications in Human-computer interface(HCI). Hand gestures recognition can be used in application such as automobile interface, medicine industries, gaming zones, public services etc. Among several gestures based recognition system, Hand Gesture is one of the easiest and convenient ways to communicate with the computer. Hand gestures are basically used by deaf and dumb people, so various sign languages are used. In this project, American Sign Language is used. This work is carried out in three steps: i) preprocessing, ii) Feature Extraction, iii) Classification. In the preprocessing step the input image which is exposed to illumination, rotation, and scaling is dealt with. The extraction of hand region out of the entire image is a challenging task, in this work YCbCr color space based skin color detection is done for hand gesture image for both uniform background and complex background. Various Morphological operations are also performed on the binary image for removing the unwanted redundancies from the image. For feature extraction, Edge Orientation Histogram (EOH), Block Based features (BBF), and Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)is used. The former is a contour based feature extraction approach in which only hand gesture boundary is considered for extraction of features. The second one is the block based feature extraction algorithm; in this, the shape of the gesture image is taken for generating the feature vector. The later one is Scale-invariant feature transform, this algorithm is mainly used in object and scene recognition due to its flexibility towards images which are prone to scaling and rotation variance. Fusion of edge orientation histogram and block based features are also done to make the system more efficient. The third step in hand gesture recognition is the Classification stage. In this part, the feature extracted from all the feature extraction algorithms are used. The two classifiers used in this project are Dynamic time warping(DTW)inspired by the time sequence matching and multi-class Support vector Machine(SVM).The dataset is divided into two equal parts for training and testing of the classifier. The system is made real time applicable by taking gesture database of multiple users under varying light conditions. The proposed work shows that the scale-invariant feature transform shows better results as compared to other two features extraction algorithm. For classifiers, the Support Vector Machine shows to be the better classifier as compared to dynamic time warping due to its time constraints.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2795045134", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:196121984"}

Vegetation mapping is one of the most critical challenges of remote sensing society in forestry applications. Sentinel-1 dataset has the potential of vegetation mapping, but because of its limited number of polarizations, full polarized vegetation indexes are not accessible. The Sentinel-2 dataset is more suitable for vegetation mapping because a wide variety of vegetation indexes can be extracted from them. Handling this large number of vegetation indexes needs a robust feature extractor. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) extract relevant features through their deep feature layers structure and throw out disturbances from small to large scales. Hence, they can be far useful for classifying remote sensing data when the number of input bands is considerable. After pre-processing Sentinel-1 and 2 datasets and extracting the dual-polarized and optical vegetation indexes, we fed the sentinel-1 vegetation indexes alongside the VV and VH sigma Nought bands to a Random Forest (RF) and 1D CNN classifier. Also, 13 spectral features of the Sentinel-2 and the extracted indexes like Blue Ratio (BR), Vegetation index based on Red Edge (VIRE) and Normalized Near Infrared (NNIR) were imported to a RF and 1D CNN. The classification result of Sentinel-1 data showed that Dual Polarized Soil Vegetation Index (DPSVI) is a good indicator for discriminating vegetation pixels. Also, the experiment on the Sentinel-2 dataset using 1D CNN resulted in True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate of 0.839 and 0.034, respectively.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-4-W18-435-2019", "venue": null, "journal": "ISPRS - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2980826958", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["134245095", "58374281", "40412117", "58920831", "5052029", "126159101", "135305823", "45028242", "129298946", "38953733", "17054454", "40166772"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:207827447"}

If a pixel is detected as a corrupted pixel, the noise-free reduction median filter will be triggered to replace it. Otherwise, it remains unchanged. Then, to improve the quality of the restored image, a decision impulse filter is put to work in the second-pass filtering procedure.

However, these graph kernels are not necessarily positive-definite. More importantly, computing the graph kernel matrix will have at least quadratic {time} complexity in terms of the number and the size of the graphs. In this paper, we propose a new family of global alignment graph kernels, which take into account the global properties of graphs by using geometric node embeddings and an associated node transportation based on earth mover's distance. Compared to existing global kernels, the proposed kernel is positive-definite. Our graph kernel is obtained by defining a distribution over \\emph{random graphs}, which can naturally yield random feature approximations. The random feature approximations lead to our graph embeddings, which is named as \"random graph embeddings\" (RGE). In particular, RGE is shown to achieve \\emph{(quasi-)linear scalability} with respect to the number and the size of the graphs.

However, the high usability and accessibility of OSNs have exposed many information quality (IQ) problems which consequently decrease the performance of the OSNs dependent applications. Social spammers are a particular kind of ill-intentioned users who degrade the quality of OSNs information through misusing all possible services provided by OSNs. Social spammers spread many intensive posts/tweets to lure legitimate users to malicious or commercial sites containing malware downloads, phishing, and drug sales. Given the fact that Twitter is not immune towards the social spam problem, different researchers have designed various detection methods which inspect individual tweets or accounts for the existence of spam contents. However, although of the high detection rates of the account-based spam detection methods, these methods are not suitable for filtering tweets in the real-time detection because of the need for information from Twitter\u2019s servers. At tweet spam detection level, many light features have been proposed for real-time filtering; however, the existing classification models separately classify a tweet without considering the state of previous handled tweets associated with a topic. Also, these models periodically require retraining using a ground-truth data to make them up-to-date. Hence, in this paper, we formalize a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) as a time-dependent model for real-time topical spam tweets filtering. More precisely, our method only leverages the available and accessible meta-data in the tweet object to detect spam tweets exiting in a stream of tweets related to a topic (e.g., #Trump), with considering the state of previously handled tweets associated to the same topic.

The water level of a river is dependent upon variables such as the month, volume of rainfall, temperature, relative humidity and surface wind. The main purpose of this research is to find a suitable method to predict the water level of Galas River in Kelantan to anticipate flood. In this research, secondary data on water level of Galas River was collected from the Department of Irrigation and Drainage Malaysia and Malaysian Meteorological Department. Some of the data were missing in certain months, thus these data were replaced by the use of means and linear regression based on the related months in other years as treatments of these missing data. Both these treatments were included in the methods to analyse data. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and SVR-based time series regression were used to analyse the data. Using the MLR analysis, multicollinearity was detected and addressed by applying PLSR. However, this technique which is a linear based model may not be appropriate in a nonlinear case such as the Galas River case. In this study, a nonlinear method, SVR, was applied. Besides that, SVR-based time series regression was proposed to cater for the time-based water level data, and to overcome the issue of linearity and multicollinearity. The result shows that linear regression is a better data treatment in SVR and SVR-based time series regressions. In addition, using Gaussian kernel, the results showed that these regressions have lower mean squared error of cross-validation as compared to MLR and PLSR. The major finding from this study is that both SVR and SVR-based time series regression used to anticipate flood by predicting the water level is significantly better than MLR and PLSR.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2274959363", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:112898668"}

The spheroidal response coefficients B j k correspond to the k th spheroidal response to the j th spheroidal excitation. The B j k have been shown to be ::: unique properties of an object, in that objects producing different scattered fields must be characterized by different B j k . Therefore, the B j k coefficients may be useful in discrimination. We use these coefficients rather than dipole moments because they are part of a physically complete, rigorous model of the object's response.

In simulation studies, the SVM is very successful in classifying independent sets of objects of the same type as the training set. Furthermore, we see that the B j k are not related to size or signal strength of the object in any simple or visually discernible way. However, SVM is still able to sort the objects correctly.

For a certain task that is short of labeled data, the cost of large-scale data annotation is usually prohibitively expensive. Through transferring the already learnt knowledge from a different but related source domain that is sufficiently labeled, domain adaptation aims to relieve such a burden for the target domain. The recent studies reveal that learning domain-invariant features has gained great successes in unsupervised domain adaptation. However, domain invariance does not necessarily imply discriminative representations in the target domain due to the lack of labeled target data. To address this issue, we propose a new unsupervised domain adaptation method named TarGAN, which can successfully disentangle the class and the style codes of the target generator and generate Target samples with given class labels based on the recent advances of Generative Adversarial Networks. This is achieved by tying the high-level layers of the source generator and the target generator, and concurrently enforcing high mutual information between the class code and the generated images. Accompanied with given class labels, these generated target images can significantly improve the classifier\u2019s discriminative ability on the target domain.

The fast development of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based deep learning architectures realises an efficient and effective SISR to boost the spatial resolution of natural images captured by digital cameras. However, the SISR for medical images is still a very challenging problem. This is due to (1) compared to natural images, in general, medical images have lower signal to noise ratios, (2) GAN based models pre-trained on natural images may synthesise unrealistic patterns in medical images which could affect the clinical interpretation and diagnosis, and (3) the vanilla GAN architecture may suffer from unstable training and collapse mode that can also affect the SISR results. In this paper, we propose a novel lesion focused SR (LFSR) method, which incorporates GAN to achieve perceptually realistic SISR results for brain tumour MRI images. More importantly, we test and make comparison using recently developed GAN variations, e.g., Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) and WGAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP), and propose a novel multi-scale GAN (MS-GAN), to achieve a more stabilised and efficient training and improved perceptual quality of the super-resolved results. Based on both quantitative evaluations and our designed mean opinion score, the proposed LFSR coupled with MS-GAN has performed better in terms of both perceptual quality and efficiency.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1901.03419", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ISBI.2019.8759517", "venue": "2019 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2019)", "journal": "2019 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2019)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2961918160,2909712391,2963578539", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["7508745", "31403004", "3707987", "3707471", "14278292", "5651246", "2185959", "21618854", "6540453", "4342027", "4133363", "211227", "206594692", "52269806", "3662996", "1033682", "13943041", "10894094", "14124313", "30500715", "3902706", "21706467", "3931957", "49552389"], "inbound_citations": ["207915348", "214802615", "148571640", "211078176", "198186234"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:57825743"}

Linking these various sources of information requires a common key shared by these data sources. The key is the server names. Unfortunately, due to historical as well as practical reasons, the server names are not always present in the tickets as a standalone field. Rather, they are embedded in unstructured text fields such as abstract and descriptions.

This chapter presents results on the development of an evolutionary (EANN) and an evolving fuzzy granular (EGNN) neural network for detecting and classifying inter-turns short-circuit in the stator windings of induction motors. A condition monitoring system based on features extracted from voltage and current waveforms associated with a type of neural network is proposed. Both EANN and EGNN are able to develop their parameters and structure according to data samples and a fitness function or error index. Real-programming-based genetic operators, i.e., mutation, recombination, and selection operators, were customized to address the fault detection problem in question. Operators and rates were evaluated in order to obtain a consistent and effective EANN learning algorithm. EGNN handles gradual and abrupt changes typical of nonstationary environment using fuzzy granules and fuzzy aggregation operators. While EGNN is online adaptive, EANN requires a set of initial data. Such initial dataset for training offline neural networks was obtained from a modified induction motor properly designed for insertion of stator shorted-turns and from a fault simulation model useful to extend the dataset by interpolation. Aspects of the neural models, such as classification performance, computational complexity, and compactness, are compared with each other and with the results obtained using a conventional feedforward neural network of similar structure, but trained by a deterministic gradient descent algorithm.

This is largely due to the small repertoire of analysed samples, and to the limitation in the number of states or pathologies usually addressed. Moreover, the influence of potential deviations on the gene expression quantification is usually disregarded. In spite of the continuous changes in omic sciences, reflected for instance in the emergence of new Next-Generation Sequencing-related technologies, the existing availability of a vast amount of gene expression microarray datasets should be properly exploited. Therefore, this work proposes a novel methodological approach involving the integration of several heterogeneous skin cancer series, and a later multiclass classifier design. This approach is thus a way to provide the clinicians with an intelligent diagnosis support tool based on the use of a robust set of selected biomarkers, which simultaneously distinguishes among different cancer-related skin states. To achieve this, a multi-platform combination of microarray datasets from Affymetrix and Illumina manufacturers was carried out. This integration is expected to strengthen the statistical robustness of the study as well as the finding of highly-reliable skin cancer biomarkers. Specifically, the designed operation pipeline has allowed the identification of a small subset of 17 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from which to distinguish among 7 involved skin states. These genes were obtained from the assessment of a number of potential batch effects on the gene expression data. The biological interpretation of these genes was inspected in the specific literature to understand their underlying information in relation to skin cancer. Finally, in order to assess their possible effectiveness in cancer diagnosis, a cross-validation Support Vector Machines (SVM)-based classification including feature ranking was performed. The accuracy attained exceeded the 92% in overall recognition of the 7 different cancer-related skin states.

Graph representation models have thus emerged as a unified vocabulary across scientific domains. The advantage of graphs for visualization of systems is that graph theoretic literature can be used for their analysis. Therefore, systems from online social networking, economics, biology, internet, citation and e-commerce are being modelled as graphs (entities as nodes and relationships as edges). Inspite of many advantages in analysis and inferencing, there are several disadvantages associated with network models. To overcome these disadvantages, Network Representation Learning (NRL) has emerged as a popular solution. Representative learning is utilized as conventional graph representation of a social network creates inter-dependency between the nodes of the system. Because of such inter-dependency it is not conceivable to straightforwardly apply machine learning strategies for their examination. To conquer such a disadvantage, network embedding frameworks represent a graph in a latent space where the coupling between nodes no longer exists. The present inquiry proposes an ERGM based model for making low dimensional graph representation of social network dependent on homophily (HLS). Such a model has favorable circumstances over other representative learning procedures explored in the literature as it very well may be utilized even on social networks with side information.

First the nodal temperature of a turbine blisk is predicted using computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations for a limited number of engine operating points.

In this paper, we propose DeLiGAN \u2013 a novel GAN-based architecture for diverse and limited training data scenarios. In our approach, we reparameterize the latent generative space as a mixture model and learn the mixture models parameters along with those of GAN.

Multilabel learning generates training models to map feature vectors to multiple labels. There are several significant challenges in multilabel learning. Samples in multilabel learning are usually described with high-dimensional features and some features may be sequentially extracted. Thus, we do not know the full feature set at the beginning of learning, referred to as streaming features. In this paper, we introduce fuzzy mutual information to evaluate the quality of features in multilabel learning, and design efficient algorithms to conduct multilabel feature selection when the feature space is completely known or partially known in advance. These algorithms are called multilabel feature selection with label correlation (MUCO) and multilabel streaming feature selection (MSFS), respectively. MSFS consists of two key steps: online relevance analysis and online redundancy analysis. In addition, we design a metric to measure the correlation between the label sets, and both MUCO and MSFS take label correlation to consideration. The proposed algorithms are not only able to select features from streaming features, but also able to select features for ordinal multilabel learning. However streaming feature selection is more efficient. The proposed algorithms are tested with a collection of multilabel learning tasks.

SVMs can informally be described as a kind of regularized M-estimators for functions and have demonstrated their usefulness in many complicated real-life problems. During the last years a great part of the statistical research on SVMs has concentrated on the question how to design SVMs such that they are universally consistent and statistically robust for nonparametric classification or nonparametric regression purposes. In many applications, some qualitative prior knowledge of the distribution P or of the unknown function f to be estimated is present or the prediction function with a good interpretability is desired, such that a semiparametric model or an additive model is of interest. ::: In this paper we mainly address the question how to design SVMs by choosing the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) or its corresponding kernel to obtain consistent and statistically robust estimators in additive models. We give an explicit construction of kernels - and thus of their RKHSs - which leads in combination with a Lipschitz continuous loss function to consistent and statistically robust SMVs for additive models.

Specifically, the more similar to the anchor instance, the higher degree of the original feature of an instance remains unchanged in the adapted representation, and vice versa. This adapted representation for the data actually expresses the local structure around the corresponding anchor, and then any transfer learning method can be applied to this adapted representation for a prediction model, which focuses more on the neighborhood of the anchor. Next, based on multiple anchors, multiple anchor adapters can be built and combined into an ensemble for final output. Additionally, we develop an effective measure to select the anchors for ensemble building to achieve further performance improvement. Extensive experiments on hundreds of text classification tasks are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of ENCHOR.

While most traditional statistical methods can only elucidate main effects of genetic variants on risk for disease, certain machine learning approaches are particularly suited to discover higher order and non-linear effects. One such approach is the Random Forests (RF) algorithm. The use of RF for SNP discovery related to human disease has grown in recent years; however, most work has focused on small datasets or simulation studies which are limited. Results: Using a multiple sclerosis (MS) case-control dataset comprised of 300 K SNP genotypes across the genome, we outline an approach and some considerations for optimally tuning the RF algorithm based on the empirical dataset. Importantly, results show that typical default parameter values are not appropriate for large GWA datasets. Furthermore, gains can be made by sub-sampling the data, pruning based on linkage disequilibrium (LD), and removing strong effects from RF analyses. The new RF results are compared to findings from the original MS GWA study and demonstrate overlap. In addition, four new interesting candidate MS genes are identified, MPHOSPH9, CTNNA3, PHACTR2 and IL7, by RF analysis and warrant further follow-up in independent studies. Conclusions: This study presents one of the first illustrations of successfully analyzing GWA data with a machine learning algorithm. It is shown that RF is computationally feasible for GWA data and the results obtained make biologic sense based on previous studies. More importantly, new genes were identified as potentially being associated with MS, suggesting new avenues of investigation for this complex disease.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC2896336", "pubmed_id": "20546594", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2156-11-49", "venue": "BMC Genetics", "journal": "BMC Genetics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2158416439", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["5473663", "8531835", "11718083", "15245447", "6532142", "55311", "954418", "16914291", "89141", "60993494", "207738357", "17166335", "25757453", "1050748", "3093707", "33803669", "18610108", "8529157", "1992545", "10820687", "13916214", "195685600", "1648462"], "inbound_citations": ["53741479", "85516339", "90137205", "5613979", "15405312", "29270500", "212737237", "73174490", "215329727", "15711501", "3631273", "7344044", "25508733", "52010826", "17148495", "2130307", "25764339", "214984300", "13408145", "55302928", "34944152", "14937584", "4655108", "23788924", "51677306", "14544352", "215197107", "23867682", "330447", "53736167", "2181092", "1746430", "4499573", "18324687", "59676293", "215143708", "4555526", "433384", "15850826", "132665106", "145813518", "34102812", "201707817", "214832726", "13915933", "21456420", "15130009", "214855807", "18714254", "3841669", "214847929", "7219481", "990783", "4310988", "215217360", "215592168", "44088607", "54845706", "24122243", "4488929", "53992037", "16262079", "5472126", "215538758", "73494584", "198195352", "2047716", "18377491", "14892214", "215628171", "11229566", "49667509", "49321106", "32661733", "325442", "1862788", "21029222", "14935803", "12454277", "37506818", "15583323", "1040625", "3579457", "52290226"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18401995"}

We apply the same techniques on a sub-sample of 142 known gamma-ray pulsars to classify them into two major subcategories: young (YNG) and millisecond pulsars (MSP).

Currently, there are two commonly used strategies to handle the problem of incomplete data: 1) discard samples having missing features; and 2) impute those missing values via specific techniques. In the first case, a significant amount of useful information is lost and, in the second case, additional noise and artifacts might be introduced into the data. Also, previous studies generally focus on the pairwise relationships among subjects, without considering their underlying complex (e.g., high-order) relationships. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a multi-hypergraph learning method for dealing with incomplete multimodality data. Specifically, we first construct multiple hypergraphs to represent the high-order relationships among subjects by dividing them into several groups according to the availability of their data modalities. A hypergraph regularized transductive learning method is then applied to these groups for automatic diagnosis of brain diseases.

We use the machine learning framework to better define the problem and to develop new unbiased performance measures and statistical tests to compare objectively new approaches. We propose a new interpretation of the state-of-the-art Gaussian Mixture Model based system and show that they are discriminant and equivalent to a mixture of linear classifiers. A general framework for score normalization is also given for both probability and non-probability based models. With this new framework we better show the hypotheses made for the well known Z- and T- score normalization techniques. Several uses of discriminant models are then proposed. In particular, we develop a new sequence kernel for Support Vector Machines that generalizes an other sequence kernel found in the literature. If the latter is limited to a polynomial form the former allows the use of infinite space kernels such as Radial Basis Functions. A variant of this kernel that finds the best match for each frame of the sequence to be compared, actually outperforms the state-of-the-art systems. As our new sequence kernel is computationally costly for long sequences, a clustering technique is proposed for reducing the complexity. We also address in this thesis some problems specific to speaker verification such as the fact that the classes are highly unbalanced. And the use of a specific intra- and inter-class distance distribution is proposed by modifying the kernel in order to assume a Gaussian noise distribution over negative examples.

In this work, an efficient algorithm, GLMBoost, coupled with Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique (SMOTE) is developed and utilized to overcome the problem for several imbalanced datasets from PubChem BioAssay. By applying the proposed combinatorial method, those data of rare samples (active compounds), for which usually poor results are generated, can be detected apparently with high balanced accuracy (Gmean). As a comparison with GLMBoost, Random Forest (RF) combined with SMOTE is also adopted to classify the same datasets. Our results show that the former (GLMBoost + SMOTE) not only exhibits higher performance as measured by the percentage of correct classification for the rare samples (Sensitivity) and Gmean, but also demonstrates greater computational efficiency than the latter (RF + SMOTE).

Rather than seeking a single model, we consider a series of models under gradually relaxing conditions, which form a hierarchical structure. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach we implemented it in two classifiers that construct multi-part models: one based on the so-called lattice machine and the other one based on rough set rule induction. This leads to hierarchical versions of the classifiers. The classification performance of these two hierarchical classifiers is compared with C4.5, Support Vector Machine (SVM), rule based classifiers (with the optimisation of rule shortening) implemented in Rough Set Exploration System (RSES), and a method combining k-nn with rough set rule induction (RIONA in RSES).

Red-Green-Blue (RGB) blending of multiple seismic attributes and forwarding seismic modelling are commonly used in the analysis of compound sand bodies. However, RGB blending of multiple seismic attributes can only qualitatively describe the boundaries and thickness of sand bodies. The forward seismic modelling techniques previously documented in the literature are not effective when depicting the geometry of, and stacking relationships between, sand bodies (i.e., reservoir compartmentalisation). Hence, we propose in this work a new workflow that combines fused spectral-decomposition seismic attributes (SDSAs) and forwarding seismic modelling to quantitatively predict sand thickness, and to characterise stacking relationships between sand bodies. First, we employ a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to fuse high, middle, and low frequency components (attributes) of seismic data so as to quantitatively predict the thickness of sand bodies. Second, we define the seismic waveform response patterns corresponding to the typical conceptual stacked sand bodies. With the constraints of waveform patterns and predicted sand thickness (fused SDSAs), the geometry and stacking relationships of the sand bodies are characterised by forward seismic modelling. To illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed workflow, we apply it to the Neogene Minghuazhen Formation (Nm) of the QHD 32\u20136 oil field, Bohai Bay Basin, China.

{"paper_id": "36726968", "title": "A Connectionist Approach to Algorithmic Composition", "authors": [{"first": "Peter M.", "middle": [], "last": "Todd", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "With the advent of von Neumann-style computers, widespread exploration of new methods of music composition became possible. For the first time, complex sequences of carefully specified symbolic operations could be performed in a rapid fashion. Composers could develop algorithms embodying the compositional rules they were interested in and then use a computer to carry out these algorithms. In this way, composers could soon tell whether the results of their rules held artistic merit. This approach to algorithmic composition, based on the wedding between von Neumann computing machinery and rule-based software systems, has been prevalent for the past thirty years. The arrival of a new paradigm for computing has made a different approach to algorithmic composition possible. This new computing paradigm is called parallel distributed processing (PDP), also known as connectionism. Computation is performed by a collection of several simple processing units connected in a network and acting in cooperation (Rumelhart and McClelland 1986). This is in stark contrast to the single powerful central processor used in the von Neumann architecture. One of the major features of the PDP approach is that it replaces strict rule-following behavior with regularity-learning and generalization (Dolson 1989). This fundamental shift allows the development of new algorithmic composition methods that rely on learning the structure of existing musical examples and generalizing from these learned structures to compose new pieces. These methods contrast greatly with the majority of older schemes that simply follow a previously assembled set of compositional rules, resulting in brittle systems typically unable to appropriately handle unexpected musical situations. To be sure, other algorithmic composition methods in the past have been based on abstracting certain features from musical examples and using these to create new compositions. Techniques such as Markov modeling with transition probability analysis (Jones 1981), Mathews' melody interpolation method (Mathews and Rosler 1968), and Cope's EMI system (Cope 1987) can all be placed in this category. However, the PDP computational paradigm provides a single powerful unifying approach within which to formulate a variety of algorithmic composition methods of this type. These new learning methods combine many of the features of the techniques listed above and add a variety of new capabilities. Perhaps most importantly, though, they yield different and interesting musical results. This paper presents a particular type of PDP network for music composition applications. Various issues are discussed in designing the network, choosing the music representation used, training the network, and using it for composition. Comparisons are made to previous methods of algorithmic composition, and examples of the network's output are presented. This paper is intended to provide an indication of the power and range of PDP methods for algorithmic composition and to encourage others to begin exploring this new approach. Hence, rather than merely presenting a reduced compositional technique, alternative approaches and tangential ideas are included throughout as points of departure for further efforts.", "year": 1989, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2307/3679551", "venue": null, "journal": "Computer Music Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2067621398", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15375627", "56723681", "191373421", "57068783", "12926318", "60278733", "9563026", "19286486", "2763403"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:36726968"}

Therefore, this study aimed to predict physical, chemical, and mineralogical soil properties using vis\u2013NIR (350\u20132500 nm) and mid-IR (4000\u2013400 cm\u2212 1) spectral libraries and statistically compare their modeling performances. We used 1259 soil samples distributed along four Brazilian States. Soil particle size, chemical analyses including macro and micronutrients, and oxides from sulfuric acid digestion were performed. Vis\u2013NIR reflectance data were obtained by the FieldSpec Pro sensor while mid-IR data were collected using the Nicolet 6700 FT-IR sensor. Support Vector Machine was used as multiple regression algorithm and modeling performance was evaluated by R2, RMSE and RPIQ. This research presented a complete prediction analysis of soil properties important for survey, classification, and fertility management. Models fit very well (0.76 \u2264 R2 \u2264 0.90 and 2.81 \u2264 RPIQ \u2264 5.62) for sand, clay, Al3+, H + Al3+, CEC, clay activity, Fe2O3, and TiO2 predictions, and showed reasonable performance (0.50 \u2264 R2 \u2264 0.73 and 1.83 \u2264 RPIQ \u2264 3.78) for OC, Ca, Mg, SB, V%, m%, pH in H2O, oxides (Si, Al, and Mn), and Cu and Mn (micronutrients).

However, automated quantification of angiogenesis is still in its primitive stage, and deserves more intelligent methods by taking advantages accruing from novel computer algorithms.ResultsThe newly introduced characteristics of subimages performed well in identification of region-of-angiogenesis.

We conduct experiments on the controllers' robustness at the excitation level, which corresponds to either the maximum swimming speed or efficiency by randomly varying the segmental connection weights and on some occasions also the intersegmental couplings, through varying noise ranges. Interestingly, although the swimming performance (in terms of maximum speed and efficiency) of the Ekeberg biological controller is not as good as that of the artificially evolved controllers, it is relatively robust against noise in the neural networks. This suggests that the natural evolutions have evolved a swimming controller that is good enough to survive in the real world.

This heavily impairs the quality of personalized items' recommendation during the initial phase of the learning environment.

Recent convolutional neural network (CNN) based method has shown excellent performance by learning mapping relation using pairs of low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) facial images. However, since the HR facial image reconstruction using CNN is conventionally aimed to increase the PSNR and SSIM metrics, the reconstructed HR image might not be realistic even with high scores. An adversarial framework is proposed in this study to reconstruct the HR facial image by simultaneously generating an HR image with and without blur. First, the spatial resolution of the LR facial image is increased by eight times using a five-layer CNN. Then, the encoder extracts the features of the up-scaled image. These features are finally sent to two branches (decoders) to generate an HR facial image with and without blur.

Traditional active learning algorithms can only handle single-label problems, that is, each data is restricted to have one label. Our approach takes into account the multi-label information, and select the unlabeled data which can lead to the largest reduction of the expected model loss. Specifically, the model loss is approximated by the size of version space, and the reduction rate of the size of version space is optimized with Support Vector Machines (SVM). An effective label prediction method is designed to predict possible labels for each unlabeled data point, and the expected loss for multi-label data is approximated by summing up losses on all labels according to the most confident result of label prediction.

Results show that the three considered anonymity networks (Tor, I2P, JonDonym) can be easily distinguished (with an accuracy of 99.99%), telling even the specific application generating the traffic (with an accuracy of 98.00%).", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.23919/ITC.2017.8064342", "venue": "2017 29th International Teletraffic Congress (ITC 29)", "journal": "2017 29th International Teletraffic Congress (ITC 29)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2983889027,2763433824,2767547573", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["43887", "128543", "2492677", "27757715", "3813469", "13172512", "4648979", "513999", "14919420", "14737598", "18032355", "4375594", "6505337", "2409630", "8241067", "12421305", "10250863", "1199826", "15440893", "13861754", "14265444", "190432", "89141", "4649218", "140109802", "14110902"], "inbound_citations": ["47009810", "211219231", "210954027"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3786136"}

In the first part the concept of representation that underlies connectionist modeling is made explicit. It is argued that the connectionist view of representation relies on a correlational theory of semantic content- i.e., the covariation between internal and external states is taken as the basis for ascribing meaning to internal states. The problems and virtues of such a correlational approach to internal representation are addressed. The second part of the paper is concerned with whether connectionism is capable of accounting for the apparent productivity and systematicity of language and thought. There is an evaluation of the recent arguments of Fodor and Pylyshyn, who claim that systematicity can only be explained if one conceives of mental representations as structured symbols composed of context-free constituents. There is a review of empirical evidence that strongly suggests that concepts are not fixed memory structures and that the meaning of constituent symbols varies, depending on the context in which they are embedded. On the basis of this review it is concluded that the meaning of a complex expression is not computed from the context-free meanings of the constituents, and that strong compositionality, as endorsed by Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988), seems implausible as a process theory for the comprehension of complex concepts. Instead, the hypothesis is endorsed that constraint satisfaction in distributed connectionist networks may allow for an alternative account of weak compositionality compatible with the context sensitivity of meaning. In the final section, it is argued that neither mere implementation of a \u201clanguage of thought\u201d in connectionist networks nor radical elimination of symbol systems seems to be a fruitful research strategy, but that it might be more useful to discuss how connectionist systems can develop the capacity to use external symbol systems like language or logic without instantiating symbol systems themselves.", "year": 1990, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/BF00877534", "venue": null, "journal": "Psychological Research", "mag_id": "2046663134", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["18543168", "22205658", "9051478", "15752373"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:144703688"}

Their ability to simultaneously satisfy multiple soft constraints allows them to select from conflicting information in finding a plausible interpretation of a situation. However these networks are poor at reasoning using the standard semantics of classical logic, based on truth in all possible models. This article shows that using an alternate semantics, based on truth in a single most plausible model, there is an elegant mapping from theories expressed using the syntax of propositional logic onto connectionist networks. An extension of this mapping to allow for limited use of quantifiers suffices to build a network from knowledge bases expressed in a frame language similar to KL-ONE. Although finding optimal models of these theories is intractable, the networks admit a hill climbing search algorithm that can be tuned to give satisfactory answers in familiar situations.

With regard to system identification, Bayesian statistics is a very promising methodology, which provides for the first time a sound way to include physical information about the diagnostics in the evaluation of the error bars. In a prototypical application, a Bayesian statistical approach determines the magnetic topology without any assumption on the equilibrium and provides clear confidence intervals on all the derived quantities. This technique, which complements another more traditional approach based on the Grad-Shafranov equation, can be implemented to provide results about every few milliseconds and therefore it can be envisaged to exploit for feedback purposes not only the topology of the ideal flux surfaces but also the confidence intervals. Some phenomena in the evolution of Tokamak plasmas, like disruptions, are too dangerous and prohibitively difficult to control. For these cases avoidance is the best alternative and therefore specific classifiers have been trained and optimised to predict the occurrence of disruptions.

This can be referred to as a typical problem of the presence of mixed pixels in the images. A number of automatic information extracting image classification algorithms have been developed over the years for flood mapping using optical remote sensing images, with most labelling a pixel as a particular class. However, they often fail to generate reliable flood inundation mapping because of the presence of mixed pixels in the images. To solve this problem, spectral unmixing methods have been developed. In this thesis, methods for selecting endmembers and the method to model the primary classes for unmixing, the two most important issues in spectral unmixing, are investigated. ::: ::: We conduct comparative studies of three typical spectral unmixing algorithms, Partial Constrained Linear Spectral unmixing, Multiple Endmember Selection Mixture Analysis and spectral unmixing using the Extended Support Vector Machine method. They are analysed and assessed by error analysis in flood mapping using MODIS, Landsat and World View-2 images. The Conventional Root Mean Square Error Assessment is applied to obtain errors for estimated fractions of each primary class. Moreover, a newly developed Fuzzy Error Matrix is used to obtain a clear picture of error distributions at the pixel level. This thesis shows that the Extended Support Vector Machine method is able to provide a more reliable estimation of fractional abundances and allows the use of a complete set of training samples to model a defined pure class. Furthermore, it can be applied to analysis of both pure and mixed pixels to provide integrated hard-soft classification results. ::: ::: Our research also identifies and explores a serious drawback in relation to endmember selections in current spectral unmixing methods which apply fixed sets of endmember classes or pure classes for mixture analysis of every pixel in an entire image. However, as it is not accurate to assume that every pixel in an image must contain all endmember classes, these methods usually cause an over-estimation of the fractional abundances in a particular pixel. In this thesis, a subset of adaptive endmembers in every pixel is derived using the proposed methods to form an endmember index matrix.

This formulation removes the commonly used assumption in the classifier-based adaptation approach that a shared classifier exists for the same task in different domains. Specifically, the source task is to learn a linear classifier from the labelled source data and the target task is to learn a linear transform to cluster the unlabelled target data such that the original target data are mapped to a lower dimensional subspace where the geometric structure is preserved. The two tasks are jointly learned by enforcing the target transformation is close to the source classifier and the class distribution shift between domains is reduced in the meantime. Two novel classifier-based adaptation algorithms are proposed upon the formulation using Regularized Least Squares and Support Vector Machines respectively, in which unshared classifiers between the source and target domains are assumed and jointly learned to effectively deal with large domain shift. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world cross domain recognition tasks have shown that the proposed methods outperform several state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1803.09208", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.knosys.2019.104975", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2794974967,2969302795", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["63308791", "788838", "1990988", "13798326", "12271421", "7923833", "23629495", "10301285", "7263397", "4962044", "745350", "16902615", "14542261", "8148915", "6161478", "6742009", "118828957", "9440223"], "inbound_citations": ["215721754", "67872061"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:4393270"}

In this paper, we show that different properties of input data can be complementary to each other and exploring them simultaneously can make the learning model robust to the domain difference. We propose a general framework, referred to as Graph Co-Regularized Transfer Learning (GTL), where various matrix factorization models can be incorporated.

To shed some light on these connections, we employed a range of machine learning techniques to predict UFP and PM1.0 levels based on a dataset consisting of observations of weather and traffic variables recorded at a busy roadside in Hangzhou, China. Based upon the thorough examination of over twenty five classifiers used for this task, we find that it is possible to predict PM1.0 and UFP levels reasonably accurately and that tree-based classification models (Alternating Decision Tree and Random Forests) perform the best for both these particles. In addition, weather variables show a stronger relationship with PM1.0 and UFP levels, and thus cannot be ignored for predicting submicron particle levels.

Without the availability of a cure, nor a standardised clinical test, the utilisation of machine learning methods to identify individuals that are at risk of developing dementia could bring a new step towards proactive intervention. This study's goal is to carry out a precursor analysis leading to building classification models with enhanced capabilities for differentiating diagnoses of CN (Cognitively Normal), MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) and Dementia. The predictive modelling approach we propose is based on the ReliefF method combined with statistical permutation tests for feature selection, and on model training, tuning, and testing based on algorithms such as Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Gaussian Processes, Stochastic Gradient Boosting, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting. Stability of model performances were studied in computationally intensive Monte Carlo simulations. The results consistently show that our models accurately detect dementia, and also mild cognitive impairment patients by only using the inclusion of baseline measurements as predictors, thus illustrating the importance of baseline measurements.

An important challenge is to determine the reactions in which these compounds participate, which can lead to the identification of gene products responsible for novel metabolic pathways. To address this challenge, we investigate how machine learning can be used to predict potential substrates and products of oxidoreductase-catalyzed reactions. ::: ::: Results: We examined 1956 oxidation/reduction reactions in the KEGG database. The vast majority of these reactions (1626) can be divided into 12 subclasses, each of which is marked by a particular type of functional group transformation. For a given transformation, the local structures of reaction centers in substrates and products can be characterized by patterns. These patterns are not unique to reactants but are widely distributed among KEGG metabolites. To distinguish reactants from non-reactants, we trained classifiers (linear-kernel Support Vector Machines) using negative and positive examples. The input to a classifier is a set of atomic features that can be determined from the 2D chemical structure of a compound. Depending on the subclass of reaction, the accuracy of prediction for positives (negatives) is 64 to 93% (44 to 92%) when asking if a compound is a substrate and 71 to 98% (50 to 92%) when asking if a compound is a product. Sensitivity analysis reveals that this performance is robust to variations of the training data. Our results suggest that metabolic connectivity can be predicted with reasonable accuracy from the presence or absence of local structural motifs in compounds and their readily calculated atomic features. ::: ::: Availability: Classifiers reported here can be used freely for noncommercial purposes via a Java program available upon request. ::: ::: Contact: wish@lanl.gov ::: ::: Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "17060354", "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btl535", "venue": "Bioinformatics", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2139560025", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["15293541", "961425", "37161882", "206787478", "60634971", "10593928", "17563082", "6075773", "1788447", "95436738", "95532375", "5834148", "205226347", "27034326", "1719480", "15955183", "17114487", "97552132", "32456145", "31644094", "9459685", "11349033", "23689618", "30435185", "88046814", "17278119", "93893456", "12826032", "38121793", "28637672", "11700151", "14551705", "197209217", "20672785"], "inbound_citations": ["1689198", "17819652", "22785291", "1412941", "18125806", "196619280", "3087630"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15118519"}

We firstly formulate localization as a classification task, where we compare several state-of-the-art learning-based classification methods including k Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Multivariate Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). To track a moving subject, we propose two Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based methods, namely GMM-based HMM and kNN-based HMM. kNN-based HMM extends kNN into a probabilistic style to approximate the Emission Probability Matrix in HMM.

As a result, a simple bagging (SB) predictor built on such VW learners has very little improvement compared to a single classifier trained from the same data. Alternatively, we propose a Local Lazy Learning based bagging approach (L3B), where base learners are trained from a small instance subset surrounding each test instance.

It seeks to distinguish between ALI and normal one.

Because microarray data contains a large number of genes with a small number of samples, we must extract genes that are relevant for classification.

We then extract some genes using a random forest algorithm for each group. A random forest algorithm can identify which features (genes) are important for classification.

This approach however is not well suited to identify interaction between genes whose protein products potentially influence each other, which limits its power to identify molecular wiring of tumour cells dictating response to a drug. Due to the fact that signal transduction pathways are not linear and highly interlinked, the biological response they drive may be better described by the relative amount of their components and their functional relationships than by their individual, absolute expression.ResultsGene expression microarray data for 109 tumor cell lines with known sensitivity to the death ligand cytokine tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) was used to identify genes with potential functional relationships determining responsiveness to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The machine learning technique Random Forest in the statistical environment \u201cR\u201d with backward elimination was used to identify the key predictors of TRAIL sensitivity and differentially expressed genes were identified using the software GeneSpring. Gene co-regulation and statistical interaction was assessed with q-order partial correlation analysis and non-rejection rate. Biological (functional) interactions amongst the co-acting genes were studied with Ingenuity network analysis. Prediction accuracy was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operator curve using an independent dataset. We show that the gene panel identified could predict TRAIL-sensitivity with a very high degree of sensitivity and specificity (AUC = 0 \u00b7 84). The genes in the panel are co-regulated and at least 40% of them functionally interact in signal transduction pathways that regulate cell death and cell survival, cellular differentiation and morphogenesis. Importantly, only 12% of the TRAIL-predictor genes were differentially expressed highlighting the importance of functional interactions in predicting the biological response.ConclusionsThe advantage of co-acting gene clusters is that this analysis does not depend on differential expression and is able to incorporate direct- and indirect gene interactions as well as tissue- and cell-specific characteristics. This approach (1) identified a descriptor of TRAIL sensitivity which performs significantly better as a predictor of TRAIL sensitivity than any previously reported gene signatures, (2) identified potential novel regulators of TRAIL-responsiveness and (3) provided a systematic view highlighting fundamental differences between the molecular wiring of sensitive and resistant cell types.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4378270", "pubmed_id": "25527049", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2164-15-1144", "venue": "BMC Genomics", "journal": "BMC Genomics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1712581484", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["3995849", "35294762", "17120584", "1236085", "18076754", "3609292", "8204977", "8205980", "2232165", "465286", "8728079", "4500270", "24518088", "21122979", "39034908", "19954077", "22552477", "43794955", "1485272", "24234946", "12047347", "29716805", "37371441", "206049398", "34903161", "17676273", "2609401", "215595294"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13913266"}

Especially, recognition of whales and their population density estimation rely heavily on these costly and tedious methods. Acoustic survey of vocalizing cetaceans, in contrast, is emerging as a promising technique for efficient, automatic, non-invasive and convenient observation and analysis of such vocally active organisms. However, it is, yet, too premature to replace the conventional methods altogether. In this paper, we have presented our results on recognition of individual humpback whales based on their vocalization data. Cepstral coefficients from song units extracted from audio records of seven humpback whales, re-sampled at 8KHz, were subjected to cepstral analysis. The extracted coefficients were used to develop multi-class support vector machine (SVM) classifier model.

We present a novel semantic segmentation framework that is robust to such shift. The key component of the proposed framework is Color Mapping Generative Adversarial Networks (ColorMapGAN), which can generate fake training images that are semantically exactly the same as training images, but whose spectral distribution is similar to the distribution of the test images. We then use the fake images and the ground-truth for the training images to fine-tune the already trained classifier. Contrary to the existing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), the generator in ColorMapGAN does not have any convolutional or pooling layers. It learns to transform the colors of the training data to the colors of the test data by performing only one element-wise matrix multiplication and one matrix addition operations.

In this paper, the classifications of two self-acquired data groups, namely 26BD patients and 38 unrelated Healthy Controls (HCs) as well as 27 Healthy Siblings of BD (BDHSs) and 38HCs are examined. Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) is utilized to segment and pre-process the MRI data. In order to obtain the morphological alterations in the Gray Matter (GM) and White Matter (WM) of data groups separately, a general linear model is configured and a two sample t-test based statistical method is used. The obtained differentiated voxels are considered as Voxel of Interests (VOIs) and using VOIs reduces the dimension of the original data into the number of VOIs. The effects of using different covariates (i.e. total intracranial volume (TIV), age, and sex) on classification of the two data groups have been studied for GM-only, WM-only, and their combination. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimension of the extracted VOIs data and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Gaussian kernel is taken into account as a classifier.

Both high resolution QuickBird sensor data and moderate resolution Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) remotely sensed satellite data have been used in the investigation. It was observed that SVM with polynomial kernel (SVMP) achieves highest classification accuracy followed by SVM with linear kernel (SVML), SVM with RBF kernel (SVMRBF) and SVM with sigmoid kernel (SVML) while classifying QuickBird data. On the other hand, SVMS achieves highest accuracy followed by SVML, SVMP and SVMRBF in case of Landsat ETM+ data. However, faces SVMS lots of computational expenses in classifying both QuickBird and Landsat ETM+ data as compared to the SVMs with other three kernels. SVMp was found computationally more efficient with satisfactory predicting ability over all the kernels investigated here.

Commercial networks limit user access bandwidth -either physically or logically-. However, in research networks there are no individualbandwidth restrictions, since this would interfere with research tasks. User behavior in research networks has changed radically with the advent of p2p multimedia file transfers: many users take advantage of the huge bandwidth (e.g. compared to domestic DSL access) to exchange movies and the like. This behavior may have a deep impact on research network utilization. Consequently, in the framework of the MOLDEIP project, we have proposed to apply support vector machine detection to identify those activities in high-performance research network routers. Due to their high port rates, those routers cannot extract the headers of all the packets that traverse them, but only a sample.

One approach to doing that is to use data from an accelerometer to classify physical activity according to activity type (e.g., lying down, sitting, standing, or walking) or intensity (e.g., sedentary, light, moderate, or vigorous). This can be formulated as a labeled classification problem, where the model relates a feature vector summarizing the accelerometer signal in a window of time to the activity type or intensity in that window. These data exhibit two key characteristics: (1) the activity classes in different time windows are not independent, and (2) the accelerometer features have moderately high dimension and follow complex distributions. Through a simulation study and applications to three datasets, we demonstrate that a model's classification performance is related to how it addresses these aspects of the data. Dynamic methods that account for temporal dependence achieve better performance than static methods that do not. Generative methods that explicitly model the distribution of the accelerometer signal features do not perform as well as methods that take a discriminative approach to establishing the relationship between the accelerometer signal and the activity class.

This paper shows the design and development of several easy-to-implement superpixel segmentation descriptors with low computational cost, which are robust to incompleteness, geometric distortion, discrimination, and uniqueness.

Urban mobility challenges have grown massively in recent years, and have a strong influence on traffic efficiency, traffic safety and overall quality of life. Key approach for addressing urban mobility issues is the well-founded and comprehensive estimation of urban mobility. Estimation is necessary for determination of key or critical elements of urban mobility systems and for providing an accurate insight in the state of urban mobility. It enables better understanding of urban mobility and identification of weaknesses and strengths of the urban mobility system. Accurate estimate creates a foundation for improvement of existing end creation of new services in urban mobility, especial in context of cooperative systems. According to definition, while Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) focus on digital technologies providing intelligence placed at the roadside or in vehicles, cooperative ITS (C-ITS) focuses on the communication between those systems (communicating with another vehicle, with the infrastructure, or with other C-ITS systems). Therefore, data gathered from communication backbone of C-ITS systems (mobile communication network in particular) can be used as input data for urban mobility estimation. For this purpose, an expert system is created using adaptive Neuro fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) methodology.

For each training and testing actions, we divide it into segments and explore the mutual dependency between temporal segments. This property states that the similarity of two actions at one segment often implies their similarity at another. We augment each segment with extra alternatives retrieved from training data. The augmentation algorithm is designed in a way where a few alternatives are good enough to replace the original segment where corrupt frames occur. Our approach is developed upon hidden conditional random fields and leverages the flexibility of hidden variables for uncertainty handling.

They are particularly important for processing large data sets that may contain millions of documents and are typically represented by a large number, possibly tens of thousands of features. Processing large data sets thus raises the issue of computational resources and we often have to find the right trade-off between the size of the feature set and the number of training data that we can taken into account. Furthermore, depending on the selected classification technique, different feature selection methods require different optimization approaches, raising the issue of compatibility between the two. We demonstrate an effective classifier training and feature selection method that is suitable for large data collections. We explore feature selection based on the weights obtained from linear classifiers themselves, trained on a subset of training documents. While most feature weighting schemes score individual features independently from each other, the weights of linear classifiers incorporate the relative importance of a feature for classification as observed for a given subset of documents thus taking the feature dependence into account. We investigate how these feature selection methods combine with various learning algorithms. Our experiments include a comparative analysis of three learning algorithms: Naive Bayes, Perceptron, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) in combination with three feature weighting methods: Odds ratio, Information Gain, and weights from the linear SVM and Perceptron. We show that by regulating the size of the feature space (and thus the sparsity of the resulting vector representation of the documents) using an effective feature scoring, like linear SVM, we need only a half or even a quarter of the computer memory to train a classifier of almost the same quality as the one obtained from the complete data set. Feature selection using weights from the linear SVMs yields a better classification performance than other feature weighting methods when combined with the three learning algorithms. The results support the conjecture that it is the sophistication of the feature weighting method rather than its compatibility with the learning algorithm that improves the classification performance.

Subjects and Methods: A questionnaire was administered on 120 patients of age above 10 years attending the STI clinic in a tertiary hospital.

However, existing algorithms do not consider local structures in query-document feature space, and are fragile to irrelevant noise features. In this paper, we propose a novel Riemannian metric learning algorithm to capture the local structures and develop a robust LtR algorithm. First, we design a concept called ideal candidate document to introduce metric learning algorithm to query-independent model. Previous metric learning algorithms aiming to find an optimal metric space are only suitable for query-dependent model, in which query instance and documents belong to the same feature space and the similarity is directly computed from the metric space. Then we extend the new and extremely fast global Geometric Mean Metric Learning (GMML) algorithm to develop a localized GMML, namely L-GMML. Based on the combination of local learned metrics, we employ the popular Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain~(NDCG) scorer and Weighted Approximate Rank Pairwise~(WARP) loss to optimize the ideal candidate document for each query candidate set. Finally, we can quickly evaluate all candidates via the similarity between the ideal candidate document and other candidates. By leveraging the ability of metric learning algorithms to describe the complex structural information, our approach gives us a principled and efficient way to perform LtR tasks.

In the field of healthcare, we face a large amount of data, and this is one of the challenges in predicting and analyzing the target disease. With the help of data mining models, one can convert this data into valuable information, and through analyzing them logically and scientifically, one can reach accurate decision-making and actual prediction. Another challenge in the field of disease prediction is selecting features that are more significant than other features. Feature subset selection is performed to improve the performance of models with the highest accuracy. The purpose of this study is to select significant features by comparing data mining models to predict liver disease based on an extraction, loading, transformation, analysis (ELTA) approach for correct diagnosis. Hence, the data mining models are compared based on the ELTA approach, such as random forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network, Bayesian networks, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-SVM. Among these models, the PSO-SVM model has the best performance regarding the criteria of specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, Area under the Curve (AUC), F-measure, precision, and False Positive Rate (FPR). Furthermore, a 10-fold cross-validation method for evaluation of models is used so that the models were evaluated on a liver disease dataset. The average of estimated accuracy was calculated as 87.35%, 78.91%, 66.78%, 76.51% and 95.17% for Random forest, MLP Neural network, Bayesian network, SVM and PSO-SVM models, respectively.

The reason lies in its many benefits, which include QoS (Quality of Service) satisfaction, automatic resource scaling, and job/task scheduling. It is very difficult to accurately predict the workload of cloud applications if they are varying drastically. To address this issue, existing solutions use either statistical methods, which effectively detect repeating patterns but provide poor accuracy for long-term predictions, or learning methods, which develop a complex prediction model but are mostly unable to detect unusual patterns. Some solutions use a combination of both methods. However, none of them address the issue of gathering system-specific information in order to improve prediction accuracy. We propose an Advanced Model for Efficient Workload Prediction in the Cloud (AME-WPC), which combines statistical and learning methods, improves accuracy of workload prediction for cloud computing applications and can be dynamically adapted to a particular system.

Given an input problem, Meta-Learning is used to recommend SVM parameters based on well-succeeded parameters adopted in previous similar problems. The parameters returned by Meta-Learning are then used as initial search points to a search technique which will perform a further exploration of the parameter space. In this combination, we envisioned that the initial solutions provided by Meta-Learning are located in good regions in the search space (i.e. they are closer to the optimum solutions).

The predictive accuracies could be even higher, 0.74 on anxiety (by GP) and 0.64 on depression (by GP), while training and testing the models on the female sample. The classification models also showed effectiveness on detecting the cases with some symptoms.

Based on the derived data and the established scheme, a three-level classification model was construct by using Object-Oriented Image Analysis method (OBIA) method and machine learning classifiers (Random Forest classifier and SVM classifier). The model was proven to be accurate and stable by ten-fold cross validation, and five major heritage landscape elements of the village were finally extracted. Furthermore, spatial pattern characteristics and distribution differences of targeted landscapes were unveiled based on distance statistics and clustering analysis.

In light of these events this paper proposes a machine learning model which can precisely assess credit risk and predict possible loan defaulters for credit lending institutions.

This study presents an effort to synergistically combine optical and SAR data to improve the mapping of impervious surfaces. Three pairs of optical and SAR images, Landsat ETM + and ENVISAT ASAR, SPOT-5 and ENVISAR ASAR, and SPOT-5 and TerraSAR-X, were selected in three study areas to validate the effectiveness of the methods in this study. The potential of Random Forest (RF) was evaluated with parameter optimization for combining the optical and SAR images. Experiment results demonstrate some interesting findings. Firstly, the built-in out-of-bag (OOB) error is insufficient for accuracy assessment, and an assessment with additional reference data is required for combining optical and SAR images using RF. Secondly, the optimal number of variables (m) for splitting the decision tree nodes in RF should be some different from the principles reported previously, and an empirical relationship was given for determining the parameter m. Thirdly, the optimal number of decision trees (T) in RF is not sensitive to the resolutions and sensor types of optical and SAR images, and the optimal T in this study is 20. Fourthly, the combined use of optical and SAR images by using RF is effective to improve the land cover classification and impervious surface estimation, by reducing the confusions between bright impervious surface and bare soil and dark impervious surface and bare soil, as well as shaded area and water surface. Even though the easily-confused land classes tend to be different in different resolutions of images, the effectiveness of combining optical and SAR images is consistent. This improvement is more significant when combing lower resolution optical and SAR images.

The combined Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and Independent Component Analysis(ICA) method was used to solve the signal-noise frequency spectrum aliasing issues caused by Mayer wave(0.1Hz), then the signal means(SM) features were extracted as an input of Support Vector Machine(SVM) classifier. The average accuracies of 4 directions, up-down and left-right were 40.55%, 73.05%, 70.7% respectively using Hbo2(8\u201321s). This study demonstrated that Brodmann area 4 was activated, which is consistent with previous conclusions. Furthermore, we found that the orbitofrontal cortex is also involved in MI and O2sat can also serve as a classified index.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217676", "venue": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)", "journal": "2017 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2772937898", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["1627181", "40558184", "18015365", "1431563", "42002148", "12789444", "7883054", "15798110", "16650842", "9558560", "145332422", "18112993", "36150661", "14847596", "7249827", "30718509", "6650227", "1297786", "52230946", "1948389", "9839629", "220773", "31634853", "15471179", "2717719", "207152935", "537849", "16260236", "8120933", "23520425", "16616862", "207697277", "11945562", "18503061"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8523093"}

There are some existing studies that applied data mining techniques in heart disease prediction.

It is crucial to select the correct combination of significant features that can improve the performance of the prediction models.

The aim of this research is to predict whether a person might have diabetes or not. The data set will contain the patient ID, gender, age, symptoms, glucose level, blood pressure, BMI etc. The outcome will be either 1 or 0, where, 1 meaning the patient is diabetic and 0 meaning the patient is not. There are 4 types of diabetes: Gestational Diabetes, Pre-diabetes, Type 1 Diabetes, Type 2 Diabetes. The system will predict the type 2 diabetes the person might have based on the data provided. The main goal of the project is to try to increase the accuracy of the prediction. This can be done using machine learning prediction algorithms. It works well in handling multidimensional and multi-variety data in dynamic environments. One of the limitations is machine learning needs a lot of training data which might be cumbersome to work with. The outcome of this research depends on how accurate the data set is.

Moreover, for academic topics, academic concepts are important. So, the Concepts are extracted and based on the similarity between concepts, academic community has been extracted from twitter.

The second observation is that most of the errors consist of pairs of classes in which the characters have similarities (e.g. (U, V), (m, n), (O, Q), among others). Specialized local SVMs are introduced to detect the correct class among these two classification hypotheses. The hybrid MLP-SVM recognizer showed improvement, significant, in performance in terms of recognition rate compared with an MLP for a task of character recognition.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IJCNN.2011.6033309", "venue": "The 2011 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks", "journal": "The 2011 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7035291", "32887604", "205015030", "572361", "207165665", "28985342", "1799811", "13618539", "11355320", "1554719", "961425", "3196904", "61490845", "16848428", "14277863", "205905441", "28637672", "8412354", "17621243", "2228310", "9684907", "60577818", "18845336", "10602784", "2073239", "1892990", "14277863", "14956081", "8982495", "6803374", "6965369", "34069921", "61074523", "205015030", "205015030", "15782139", "36452235"], "inbound_citations": ["14810653", "10496750", "17242585", "202558409", "43353560", "201683647", "15952184", "16103534"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14928948"}

However, comparisons of performance of MFDFA and EMD in feature extraction have rarely been performed so far. To fill this gap, this paper benchmarked the performance of MFDFA against EMD by neural network (NN) and support vector machine (SVM) using a group of gearbox vibration signals containing gear faults in different types and severity levels. In this way, five characteristic parameters were obtained using MFDFA. For comparison, an eleven-dimension feature vector was acquired using EMD. Following this, either of NN and SVM served to distinguish between gearbox conditions characterized by the features extracted above. The results indicated that MFDFA is comparable to EMD in discrimination between gearbox conditions.

Although GBDT has been widely supported by existing systems such as XGBoost, LightGBM, and MLlib, one system bottleneck appears when the dimensionality of the data becomes high. As a result, when we tried to support our industrial partner on datasets of the dimension up to 330K, we observed suboptimal performance for all these aforementioned systems. In this paper, we ask \"Can we build a scalable GBDT training system whose performance scales better with respect to dimensionality of the data?\" The first contribution of this paper is a careful investigation of existing systems by developing a performance model with respect to the dimensionality of the data. We find that the collective communication operations in many existing systems only implement the algorithm designed for small messages. By just fixing this problem, we are able to speed up these systems by up to 2X. Our second contribution is a series of optimizations to further optimize the performance of collective communications. These optimizations include a task scheduler, a two-phase split finding method, and low-precision gradient histograms. Our third contribution is a sparsity-aware algorithm to build gradient histograms and a novel index structure to build histograms in parallel. We implement these optimizations in DimBoost and show that it can be 2-9X faster than existing systems.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3183713.3196892", "venue": "SIGMOD '18", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2799138232", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5707386", "11987155", "2063728", "115963355", "121049", "89141", "4650265", "2185117", "15079915", "6602568", "372467", "214797870", "14723701", "7955044", "34202706", "4336217", "13982939", "7636268", "9781315", "13426534", "35995211", "11027141", "4614646", "15388334", "12528987", "3756321", "7956687", "662423", "14525206", "16400821", "10483721", "90404", "6697674", "13052945", "15268934", "7885987"], "inbound_citations": ["195791618", "199373071", "207853357", "129945921", "209481741", "207957998"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:44132618"}

This paper proposes a novel multi-modal knowledge representation learning (MM-KRL) framework which attempts to handle knowledge from both textual and visual modal web data. It consists of two stages, i.e., webly-supervised multi-modal relationship mining, and bi-enhanced cross-modal knowledge representation learning. Compared with existing knowledge representation methods, our framework has several advantages: (1) It can effectively mine multi-modal knowledge with structured textual and visual relationships from web automatically. (2) It is able to learn a common knowledge space which is independent to both task and modality by the proposed Bi-enhanced Cross-modal Deep Neural Network (BC-DNN). (3) It has the ability to represent unseen multi-modal relationships by transferring the learned knowledge with isolated seen entities and relations into unseen relationships.

It captures further histogram features based on a novel color difference weight factors with an overlapping sliding window, which can depict the local variations and consistency in the whole image. The similarity and dissimilarity of samples are used to train the weight factor of features and an optimal subspace could be obtained at the same time. Next, we provide an effective multiple metric learning method fusing two-channel bar-shape structural features via the optimal similarity pairwise measure obtained by a dissimilarity matrix. This measure can fully mine the discriminative information and eliminate redundancy in the similar features, which make the MMLBD simple and effective.

Existing methods mainly protect the privacy by adding occlusion or noise to the original images before uploading, which is either impractical or destroying the utility of the photos. In this paper, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based image privacy protection algorithm PriGAN, which generates a privacy image for each original image to fool the recognition networks. When generating the privacy image, we consider the technique of adversarial image perturbations (AIP), which could confuse recognition networks with slight perturbations. That is, the privacy image could protect the privacy information by confusing the neural network hosted by the service providers. Meanwhile, the privacy image appears unmodified compared to the original one for human observers, and thus its utility could be preserved. The advantage of PriGAN is that it provides a general privacy protection framework for personal applications, by which privacy information of images can be protected without destroying the image utility.

Encoder models are often determined to optimize performance on training data when the real objective is to generalize well to unseen data. Although there is enough numerical evidence suggesting that noise injection (during training) at the representation level might improve the generalization ability of encoders, an information-theoretic understanding of this principle remains elusive. This paper presents a sample-dependent bound on the generalization gap of the cross-entropy loss that scales with the information complexity (IC) of the representations, meaning the mutual information between inputs and their representations. The IC is empirically investigated for standard multi-layer neural networks with SGD on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets; the behaviour of the gap and the IC appear to be in direct correlation, suggesting that SGD selects encoders to implicitly minimize the IC. We specialize the IC to study the role of Dropout on the generalization capacity of deep encoders which is shown to be directly related to the encoder capacity, being a measure of the distinguishability among samples from their representations.

To address this challenge, we propose an unsupervised incremental learning algorithm, TFusion, which is aided by the transfer learning of the pedestrians' spatio-temporal patterns in the target domain. Specifically, the algorithm firstly transfers the visual classifier trained from small labeled source dataset to the unlabeled target dataset so as to learn the pedestrians' spatial-temporal patterns. Secondly, a Bayesian fusion model is proposed to combine the learned spatio-temporal patterns with visual features to achieve a significantly improved classifier. Finally, we propose a learning-to-rank based mutual promotion procedure to incrementally optimize the classifiers based on the unlabeled data in the target domain.

In this work, we introduce RFCRYS, a Random Forest based method to predict crystallizability of proteins. RFCRYS utilizes mono-, di-, and tri-peptides amino acid compositions, frequencies of amino acids in different physicochemical groups, isoelectric point, molecular weight, and length of protein sequences, from the primary sequences to predict crystallizabillity by using two different databases. RFCRYS was compared with previous methods and the results obtained show that our proposed method using this set of features outperforms existing predictors with higher accuracy, MCC, and Specificity. Especially, our method is characterized by high Specificity of 0.95, which means RFCRYS rarely mispredicts a protein chain to be crystallizable which consequently would be useful for saving time and resources.

This paper formulates the RLR prediction as a binary classification problem that can be solved by the least square support vector machines (LS-SVM) models based on continuous trajectories detected by radar sensors. We adopt non-weighted and weighted LS-SVM models for the RLR prediction. Tuning parameters are conducted by the cross-validation in the discrete parameter space and the Bayesian inference based on the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimate in the continuous parameter space. Based on continuous trajectories, this study selects the velocity, acceleration and distance to the stop line at the red light onset time as attributes plotted in a 3-D scatter diagram. The validation results show that the performance indicated by the receiver operation characteristics (ROC) curves of the LS-SVM RLR prediction performs much better than that of the ILD model. Compared with the non-weighted LS-SVM classifier, the weighted LS-SVM classifier for RLR prediction is more flexible. In order to further reduce the RLR missing rates of based on the previous LS-SVM solution, the weighted LS-SVM is developed with a tolerated small false alarm rate by allowing a variety of unbalanced ratios to identify the relative significance of each class.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "760140471", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["3333725"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:117705005"}

Still, it is a challenging problem that involves capturing high-dimensional spatio-temporal patterns describing the variation of one's appearance over time.

In this paper, we use Conditional Random Forests to capture low-level expression transition patterns. More specifically, heterogeneous derivative features (e.g. feature point movements or texture variations) are evaluated upon pairs of images. When testing on a video frame, pairs are created between this current frame and previous ones and predictions for each previous frame are used to draw trees from Pairwise Conditional Random Forests (PCRF) whose pairwise outputs are averaged over time to produce robust estimates. Moreover, PCRF collections can also be conditioned on head pose estimation for multi-view dynamic FER. As such, our approach appears as a natural extension of Random Forests for learning spatio-temporal patterns, potentially from multiple viewpoints.

Later, the algorithm was examined by the Hydrometeorology Research Group of NSSL for 139 radar cases across the contiguous United States for a wide variety of rainfall events, all occurring during the spring and summer of 2012. The results indicated that dual polarization QPE was an improvement over legacy estimates for most of the cases.

The height of the melting layer is usually provided by the Melting Layer Detection Algorithm, which also affects the Hydrometeor Classification Algorithm.

First, aiming to eliminate the high correlation between adjacent bands and to remove the noise in the image, a new band clustering algorithm is employed to reduce the dimensions, where the dimension-reduced image can be used as spectral information features to extract linearly separable classes. Then, spatial information features are obtained by applying the multiple edge-preserving filter on the reduced-dimensional image. This filter is used to acquire more comprehensive spatial information features of the image for extraction of nonlinearly separable classes.

The contributions given on this symposium (Symposium 115, ICNAAM 2012) include the following subjects: 1, A quantum mechanical model on histone modification is proposed in the article No. 115-1. The model is initiated from the idea that protein folding can be regarded as a quantum transition between torsion states on polypeptide chain. The pioneer work on quantum folding was presented by the same author in 1995 (International Journal of Quantum Chemistry, Vol 54) and important progresses have been made in recent years. Now the concept and method was generalized to the histone modification problem. 2, In 2008 Lu et al of Inner Mongolia, China, discovered the distance conservation in a pair of transcription regulatory 7-mer motifs (Computational Biology and Chemistry, Vol 32). Distance conservation is a new kind of evolutionary conservation, weaker than the strict location conservation. Now Lu et al generalized the above work to the distance conservation of splicing regulation motifs in the article No. 115-2. 3, Cui et al of Inner Mongolia, China, investigated the combination and pathway of histone modifications by use of Bayesian network method in 2011 (Yeast,Vol 28). Now, in the article No. 115-4 they developed the approach and found the combinations dependent of transcript level. 4, Two works (No. 115-3 and 115-5)on the application of gene recognition algorithm are presented. The Jensen\u2013Shannon Divergence (JSD) with Quadratic Discriminant Analysis(QD)is essentially same as IDQD algorithm proposed by LR Zhang et al in 2003 (Nucleic Acid Research, Vol 31) and the algorithm has been proved highly accurate in the bioinformatics application, the accuracy of which can be comparable with SVM (Support Vector Machine) in some cases. 5, RNA is the central player of gene expression.

The Agricultural Resources Extraction from LiDAR Surveys (PARMAP) project component of the Nationwide Detailed Resources Assessment using LiDAR (Phil-LiDAR 2) Program aims to produce detailed agricultural maps using LiDAR. Agricultural land cover at crop level was classified through object based image analysis using Support Vector Machine as classifier and LiDAR derivatives from point cloud (2 points per sq.m.) and orthophoto (0.5-meter resolution) as inputs. An accuracy of at least 90 %, assessed using validation points from the field and through image interpretation, was required before proceeding to post-processing and map lay-out. Knowledge sharing and capacity development facilitated by the University of the Philippines Diliman (UPD) enabled partner universities across the Philippines to produce outputs for their assigned region. Considering output layers were generated by multiple teams working on different landscape complexities with some degree of data quality variability, quality checking is crucial to ensure accuracy standards were met. UPD PARMap devised a centralized and end-to-end scheme divided into four steps \u2013 land classification, GIS post-processing, schema application, and map lay-out. At each step, a block is reviewed and, subsequently, either approved or returned with documentation on required revisions. Turnaround time of review is at least one block (area ranging from 10 to 580 sq. km.) per day. For coastal municipalities, an additional integration process to incorporate mapped coastal features was applied. Common problems observed during quality checking include misclassifications, gaps between features, incomplete attributes and missing map elements. Some issues are particular to specific blocks such as problematic LiDAR derivatives. UPD addressed these problems through discussion and mentoring visits to partner universities. As of March 2017, a total of 336 municipal agricultural maps have been turned-over to various stakeholders.

Early detection of bladder tumors is important for preventing bladder cancer, reducing mortality, and improving patients' quality of life. In this paper, we used the deep learning model such as Resnet_v2_50 and Inceptionv3 to predict Bladder tumor grading and staging. When the model was trained and tested, the experiment data set coming from the Chinese University Computer Design Competition - Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Challenge, was used. The test set which accounted for 10% of the data set was randomly disrupted. First, the method of transfer learning was used to train the corresponding network where the convolutional layer parameters were fixed and the fully connected layer was retrained. Then for this data set, we compared the impact of three improved strategies on its classification accuracy. The three improved strategies were that: 1. Doing data augmentation by randomly changing brightness and contrast of images and then added the changed images to the training set. 2. Features extracted by Resnet_v2_50 and Inception_v3 were stitched before they were sent into the fully connected layer. 3. Combining the previous two methods. The experiments results showed that for the grading prediction, the inception_v3 model with data augmentation had the highest classification accuracy of 95.5%; for the staging prediction, stitching models based on the inception_v3 and Resnet_v2_50 without data augmentation had the highest classification accuracy of 92.8%. It implied the effectiveness of these two improved strategies (feature stitching and data augmentation) for different classification tasks.

Methods/Statistical Analysis: First data is broken sample wise, then correlation coefficient between channel pair for each sample is calculated. After that mean of the correlation coefficient of all channel pair for each class over all samples is calculated and in a similar manner, standard deviation from the mean is also calculated. For feature selection we have plotted a pair of the Gaussian curves between channels of two separate classes and choose those channels which give us lower misclassified area as features. Then these features are used for training purpose of Support Vector Machine (SVM). Findings: Most of the previous researches follow either signal processing approach or machine learning approach while we emphasized upon the nature of the signal propagation amongst the neurons. The basic idea behind the feature selection is taken from the way the signals propagate from one neuron to the other. In our work we assume that EEG signals follow the normal distribution and verify the fact using chi-square test. On applying SVM the accuracy of classification on testing data confirms that correlation among channels can be used for feature selection. Application/Improvements: The results can be improved by improving the pre-processing of EEG signals.

Forest area and average biomass C density increased from 10.5 million ha and 45.7 Mg C ha in 1988 to 14.2 million ha and 52.3 Mg C ha in 2012. Average C density was generally larger in the north and west of Sichuan Province compared with other regions. The expanded forest area and enhanced C density have jointly led to a rise in total C storage by 54.9% over this period in Sichuan Province. It was estimated that the forest areal expansion has been a larger contributor to C sinks than forest growth in Sichuan Province (69 vs. 31%), especially in the regions of the northwestern high mountains and the hilly country of the Sichuan basin. However, the relative contributions of areal expansion exhibited different trends in five subregions and 15 forest species groups in this province.

One of the key concepts of SVMs is the usage of a so-called kernel function, which can be thought of as a special similarity measure. In this paper we consider kernels for molecular structures, which are based on a graph representation of chemical compounds. The similarity score is calculated by computing an optimal assignment of the atoms from one molecule to those of another one, including information on specific chemical properties, membership to a substructure (e.g., aromatic ring, carbonyl group, etc.) and neighborhood for each atom. We show that by using this kernel we can achieve a generalization performance comparable to a classical model with a few descriptors, which are a-priori known to be relevant for the problem, and significantly better results than with and without performing an automatic descriptor selection. For this purpose we investigate ADME classification and regression datasets for predicting bioavailability (Yoshida), Human Intestinal Absorption (HIA), Blood-Brain-Barrier (BBB) penetration and a dataset consisting of four different inhibitor classes (SOL). We further explore the effect of combining our kernel with a problem-dependent descriptor set.

These latest progresses greatly facilitate the developments in various areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, etc. However, along with the extraordinary performance, these state-of-the-art models also bring in expensive computational cost. Directly deploying these models into applications with real-time requirement is still infeasible. Recently, Hinton etal. have shown that the dark knowledge within a powerful teacher model can significantly help the training of a smaller and faster student network. These knowledge are vastly beneficial to improve the generalization ability of the student model. Inspired by their work, we introduce a new type of knowledge -- cross sample similarities for model compression and acceleration. This knowledge can be naturally derived from deep metric learning model. To transfer them, we bring the learning to rank technique into deep metric learning formulation.

For this purpose, the generative adversarial network is introduced for tackling action prediction problem, which improves the recognition accuracy of partially observed videos though narrowing the feature difference of partially observed videos from complete ones.

As a solution, a transfer learning method in NMT is generally obtained via initializing the low-resource model (child) with the high-resource model (parent). However, leveraging the original TL to low-resource models is neither able to make full use of highly related multiple HRLs nor to receive different parameters from the same parents. In order to exploit multiple HRLs effectively, we present a language-independent and straightforward multi-round transfer learning (MRTL) approach to low-resource NMT.

Although learning scoring functions from collected data is beneficial, it can be challenging when limited data are available. Therefore, learning multiple distinct, but related, scoring functions together can increase their quality as shared regularities may be easier to identify. We propose a multitask formulation for ranking-based learning of scoring functions, where the model is trained from pairwise comparisons.

These limitations have reduced current control approaches to estimation techniques based on correlated metrics, such as electromyographic (EMG) signals. The current study investigates a parameter known to represent the nullspace of the mapping from muscle forces to joint torques in the human musculoskeletal system, i.e., muscle co-activation. It is hypothesized that this parameter is a random variable that correlates with muscle activities, measured through EMG signals. A change in this variable directly affects endpoint stiffness, and therefore system performance and stability. This study additionally presents a methodology for processing EMG (cocontraction) data prior to training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, meant to be used as a decision tool for haptic impedance control. Results presented serve as a springboard for the incorporation of a human operator model suitable for real-time implementation and sufficient to support bilateral human-robot interaction. The long-term goals of this research are to understand the mechanisms governing neuromotor adaptation in pHRI, and ultimately design a novel haptic device that tunes its impedance gains in conjunction with changes in an operator's physical and cognitive state.

The graph construction is motivated by a locally linear embedding of the detection features.

This gives our framework the uncommon ability to exploit the appearance features that are available only sporadically.

Neural representations of perceived animate objects are partially located in the primate cortical region STS, which is a region that receives convergent input from intermediate-level form and motion representations. Populations of STS cells exist which are selectively responsive to specific animated motion sequences, such as walkers. It is still unclear how and to what extent form and motion information contribute to the generation of such representations and what kind of mechanisms are involved in the learning processes. The article develops a cortical model architecture for the unsupervised learning of animated motion sequence representations. We demonstrate how the model automatically selects significant motion patterns as well as meaningful static form prototypes characterized by a high degree of articulation. Such key poses are selectively reinforced during learning through a cross talk between the motion and form processing streams. Furthermore, we show how sequence-selective representations are learned in STS by fusing static form and motion input from the segregated bottom-up driving input streams. Cells in STS, in turn, feed their activities recurrently to their input sites along top-down signal pathways. We show how such learned feedback connections enable predictions about future input as anticipation generated by sequence-selective STS cells. Network simulations demonstrate the computational capacity of the proposed model by reproducing several experimental findings from neurosciences and by accounting for recent behavioral data.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1111/tops.12075", "venue": "topiCS", "journal": "topiCS", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1966092996,2396060005", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["743350", "17449996", "2175819", "887477", "1695292", "16577977", "27153832", "14307730", "15457271", "1845969", "8315715", "26095952", "18423483"], "inbound_citations": ["15381843", "35190774", "5778576", "214939382", "7543265", "17541113", "214948304", "44754021", "18422641", "14400364", "28503880", "17372798", "3639480", "51916091", "146805343", "41015775", "8218347"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13011197"}
