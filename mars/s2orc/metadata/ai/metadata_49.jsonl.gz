At the decompression stage, a region-based dictionary is constructed from the key-frames and used to restore the reduced resolution frames to the original resolution via statistical conditional sampling. The sampling approach is based on the conditional probability of the CRF modeling by use of the constructed dictionary.

During the last 40 years, the country has faced a series of severe droughts, however that of 2015 stands out as the most extreme and prolonged. The 2015 drought impaired forest productivity and led to widespread tree mortality in this region, but the identification of tree response to drought stress remains uncertain because of its spatial variability. To address this problem, a method that can capture drought patterns and identify trees with similar reactions to drought stress is desired. This could improve the accuracy of detecting trees suffering from drought stress which is key for forest management planning. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the utility of unsupervised mapping approaches in compartments of Eucalyptus trees with similar drought characteristics based on the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and to demonstrate the value of cloud-based Google Earth Engine (GEE) resources for rapid landscape drought monitoring. Our results showed that calculating distances between pixels using three different matrices (Random Forest (RF) proximity, Euclidean and Manhattan) can accurately detect similarities within a dataset. The RF proximity matrix produced the best measures, which were clustered using Wards hierarchical clustering to detect drought with the highest overall accuracy of 87.7%, followed by Manhattan (85.9%) and Euclidean similarity measures (79.9%), with user and producer results between 84.2% to 91.2%, 42.8% to 98.2% and 37.2% to 94.7%, respectively.

Therefore, spatial econometric models (SE) were employed for modeling fire occurrence accordingly. Moreover, Random Forest (RF), which can manage the nonlinear correlation between predictors and shows steady predictive ability, was adopted. The performance of RF and SE models is discussed. Based on historical fire records of Hefei City as a case study in China, the results indicate that SE models have better predictive ability and among which the spatial autocorrelation model (SAC) is the best. Road density influences fire occurrence the most for SAC, while network distance to fire stations is the most important predictor for RF; they are selected in both models. Semivariograms are employed to explore their abilities to explain the spatial structure of fire occurrence, and the result shows that SAC works much better than RF.

In many of these application, such as object recognition, there are several classes from which the data originates. In such cases many traditional classification methods such as Artificial Neural Networks or Support Vector Machines are used. However, in some applications the training data may belong to only one class. In this case, the classification is performed by finding whether a test sample belongs to the known class or not. The main criteria in single-class classification (also known as novelty detection) is to perform the classification without any information about other classes. This chapter presents a classic problem in video processing applications and addresses the issues through novelty detection techniques. The problem at hand is to detect foreground objects in a video with quasi-stationary background. The video background is called quasistationary if the camera is static but the background itself changes due to waving tree branches, flags, water surfaces, etc. Detection of foreground region in such scenarios requires a pixel-wise background model for each pixel in the scene. Once the pixel models are built, there should be a mechanism to decide whether pixels in new frames belong to their corresponding background model or not. The generation of pixel models from their history and the decision making mechanism is a novelty detection problem. In order to address the foreground detection problem, two main approaches to novelty detection, namely statistical and analytical, are presented in this chapter. The advantage and disadvantages of these approaches are discussed.

In this work, two deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), viz. Residual Network (ResNet) and its improved version named ResNeXt, are used to detect internal mechanical damage of blueberries using hyperspectral transmittance data. The original structure and size of hypercubes are adapted for the deep CNN training. To ensure that the models are applicable to hypercube, we adjust the number of filters in the convolutional layers. Moreover, a total of 5 traditional machine learning algorithms, viz. Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Bagging and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), are performed as the comparison experiments. In terms of model assessment, k-fold cross validation is used to indicate that the model performance does not vary with the different combination of dataset. In real-world application, selling damaged berries will lead to greater interest loss than discarding the sound ones. Thus, precision, recall, and F1-score are also used as the evaluation indicators alongside accuracy to quantify the false positive rate. The first three indicators are seldom used by investigators in the agricultural engineering domain. Furthermore, ROC curves and Precision-Recall curves are plotted to visualize the performance of classifiers. The fine-tuned ResNet/ResNeXt achieve average accuracy and F1-score of 0.8844/0.8784 and 0.8952/0.8905, respectively.

In China, the key operation vehicles on the expressway are equipped with BDS to monitor the travel path. This provides a basis for predicting the traffic speed on expressway accurately. In this paper, considering the abnormal data collected by BDS, the screening and processing rules are made, and then the traffic speed sequence is extracted. Considering the data-missing problem caused by equipment failure or abnormal data elimination and the data sparse problem caused by small size of sample, a filling method based on trend-historical data is proposed.

In this paper, we have used 23 features dataset, all the features are analyzed and 15 features are selected from the total dataset. As in Parkinson tremor is present in the voice box muscles, so the variation in the period and amplitude of consecutive vocal cycles is present. The feature dataset selected consist of jitter, shimmer, harmonic to noise ratio, DFA, spread1 and PPE. Various classifiers are used and their comparison is done to find out which classifier is perfect in this environment.

We aimed to test and validate neuroradiologists9 performances in predicting the codeletion status of IDH -mutant lower grade gliomas based on simple neuroimaging metrics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred two IDH -mutant lower grade gliomas with preoperative MR imaging and known 1p/19q status from The Cancer Genome Atlas composed a training dataset. Two neuroradiologists in consensus analyzed the training dataset for various imaging features: tumor texture, margins, cortical infiltration, T2-FLAIR mismatch, tumor cyst, T2* susceptibility, hydrocephalus, midline shift, maximum dimension, primary lobe, necrosis, enhancement, edema, and gliomatosis. Statistical analysis of the training data produced a multivariate classification model for codeletion prediction based on a subset of MR imaging features and patient age. To validate the classification model, 2 different independent neuroradiologists analyzed a separate cohort of 106 institutional IDH -mutant lower grade gliomas. RESULTS: Training dataset analysis produced a 2-step classification algorithm with 86.3% codeletion prediction accuracy, based on the following: 1) the presence of the T2-FLAIR mismatch sign, which was 100% predictive of noncodeleted lower grade gliomas, ( n = 21); and 2) a logistic regression model based on texture, patient age, T2* susceptibility, primary lobe, and hydrocephalus. Independent validation of the classification algorithm rendered codeletion prediction accuracies of 81.1% and 79.2% in 2 independent readers. The metrics used in the algorithm were associated with moderate-substantial interreader agreement (\u03ba = 0.56\u20130.79). CONCLUSIONS: We have validated a classification algorithm based on simple, reproducible neuroimaging metrics and patient age that demonstrates a moderate prediction accuracy of 1p/19q-codeletion status among IDH -mutant lower grade gliomas.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30705071", "doi": "10.3174/ajnr.A5957", "venue": "AJNR.

A common practice on this topic is the so-called Info-Kmeans, which performs K-means clustering with KL-divergence as the proximity function. While expert efforts on Info-Kmeans have shown promising results, a remaining challenge is to deal with high-dimensional sparse data such as text corpora. Indeed, it is possible that the centroids contain many zero-value features for high-dimensional text vectors, which leads to infinite KL-divergence values and creates a dilemma in assigning objects to centroids during the iteration process of Info-Kmeans. To meet this challenge, in this paper, we propose a Summation-bAsed Incremental Learning (SAIL) algorithm for Info-Kmeans clustering. Specifically, by using an equivalent objective function, SAIL replaces the computation of KL-divergence by the incremental computation of Shannon entropy. This can avoid the zero-feature dilemma caused by the use of KL-divergence. To improve the clustering quality, we further introduce the variable neighborhood search scheme and propose the V-SAIL algorithm, which is then accelerated by a multithreaded scheme in PV-SAIL.

The key aspect is that the relationships and properties of the question/answer pair composed of a question and the supporting passage of an answer candidate, can be efficiently compared with those captured by the learnt model. In this paper, we define novel supervised approaches that exploit structural relationships between a question and their candidate answer passages to learn a re-ranking model. We model structural representations of both questions and answers and their mutual relationships by just using an off-the-shelf shallow syntactic parser. We encode structures in Support Vector Machines (SVMs) by means of sequence and tree kernels, which can implicitly represent question and answer pairs in huge feature spaces. Such models together with the latest approach to fast kernel-based learning enabled the training of our rerankers on hundreds of thousands of instances, which previously rendered intractable for kernelized SVMs. The results on two different QA datasets, e.g., Answerbag and Jeopardy! data, show that our models deliver large improvement on passage re-ranking tasks, reducing the error in Recall of BM25 baseline by about 18%.

It is noted for its predictive accuracy and pattern recognition ability. The new policy have attracted considerable research attention and support among researchers. Researchers at different levels have proposed and used wide-ranging approaches. However, there are issues about the efficiency and dependability of these classical methodologies. Effort in this work is directed at presenting an intelligent algorithm with efficient system model using data mining approach. To achieve this objective, a three-layered classifier system was designed, it consists of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Rule Induction and Decision Tree. The classifier system was tested successfully using case study data from twenty two (22) selected universities in Nigeria representing the six geo-political zones of the country through purposive and selective sampling technique. The results from the experiment show that J48 decision tree outperforms thirteen (13) other classification algorithms considering time taken to build the models, performance accuracy level of over 98% and Kappa statistics of 0.9678 which is very close to 1. It is therefore deduced that J48 pruned decision tree is a good algorithm suitable for the system aimed at.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2593391551", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["38239191", "59406216"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:114259033"}

Co-expressed genes were analyzed by a biclustering method, followed by gene ontology analysis of the relevant biclusters. Taking the type I interferon (IFN) pathway as an example, a classification algorithm was developed from the 102 RA patients and extended to 10 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and 100 healthy volunteers to further characterize individuals. We developed a correlation-based algorithm referred to as Classification Algorithm Based on a Biological Signature (CABS), an alternative to other approaches focused specifically on the expression levels. This algorithm applied to the expression of 35 IFN-related genes showed that the IFN signature presented a heterogeneous expression between RA, SLE and healthy controls which could reflect the level of global IFN signature activation. Moreover, the monitoring of the IFN-related genes during the anti-TNF treatment identified changes in type I IFN gene activity induced in RA patients. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: In conclusion, we have proposed an original method to analyze genes sharing an expression pattern and a biological function showing that the activation levels of a biological signature could be characterized by its overall state of correlation.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3197194", "pubmed_id": "22043277", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0024828", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "journal": "PLoS ONE", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2006353424", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["8907576", "5612356", "380598", "6321522", "206628783", "21403295", "24226826", "29704433", "14684084", "90889974", "20740370", "22876607", "20356066", "25163540", "39475017", "41711404", "40152914", "14256832", "5102023", "2190918", "13300116", "36560744", "44541784", "22262489", "7132757", "20186513", "37014854", "17661905", "6416636", "511939", "2552378", "4425504"], "inbound_citations": ["12243737", "17497376", "58603867", "215195063", "214872928", "197542860", "212681731", "8931275", "52308965", "24553916", "5676386", "4124361", "199539325", "10690880", "207694422", "208338", "211829437", "5792171", "22960721", "174810170", "215421286"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7948236"}

It often shows better content recognition results than using only unimodal methods, but depending on the used data, this is not always the case. Most of the current multimodal media content classification methods still depend on unimodal recognition results. For both uni- and multimodal approaches it is important to choose the best features and classification models. In addition, in the case of unimodal models, the final multimodal recognitions still need to be produced with an appropriate late fusion technique. In this article, we study several multi- and unimodal recognition methods, features for them and their combination techniques, in the application setup of concept detection in image\u2013text data. We consider both single- and multi-label recognition tasks. As the image features, we use GoogLeNet deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) activation features and semantic concept or classeme vectors. For text features, we use simple binary vectors for tags and the word2vec embedding vectors. The Multimodal Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM) model is used as the multimodal model and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) with both linear and non-linear radial basis function (RBF) kernels as the unimodal one. The experiments are performed with the MIRFLICKR-1M and the NUS-WIDE datasets. The results show that the two models have equally good performance in the single-label recognition task of the former database, while the Multimodal DBM produces clearly better results in the multi-label task of the latter database.

The speaker-specific suprasegmental information can not only be perceived by listening to the residual, but can also be seen in the form of excitation peaks in the residual waveform. However, the challenge lies in capturing this information from the residual signal. Higher order correlations among samples of the residual are not known to be captured using standard signal processing and statistical techniques. The Hilbert envelope of residual is shown to further enhance the excitation peaks present in the residual signal. A speaker-specific pattern is also observed in the autocorrelation sequence of the Hilbert envelope, and further in the statistics of this autocorrelation sequence.

In this work, we argue that the same holds for the temporal dynamics of brow actions and show that velocity, duration, and order of occurrence of brow actions are highly relevant parameters for distinguishing posed from spontaneous brow actions. The proposed system for discrimination between volitional and spontaneous brow actions is based on automatic detection of Action Units (AUs) and their temporal segments (onset, apex, offset) produced by movements of the eyebrows. For each temporal segment of an activated AU, we compute a number of mid-level feature parameters including the maximal intensity, duration, and order of occurrence. We use Gentle Boost to select the most important of these parameters. The selected parameters are used further to train Relevance Vector Machines to determine per temporal segment of an activated AU whether the action was displayed spontaneously or volitionally.

This will affect healthcare systems especially with the current situation of decreased bed capacity and increasing costs. Therefore, accurately predicting LOS would have a positive impact on healthcare metrics. The aim of this study is to develop a machine learning-based model approach for predicting in-hospital LOS for cardiac patients. Design Using electronic medical records, we retrospectively extracted all records of patients' visits that were admitted under adult cardiology service. Admission diagnosis and primary treating physician were reviewed to verify selection criteria. A predictive machine learning-based model approach was applied to incorporate simple baseline health data at admission time to predict LOS. Patients were divided into three groups based on their LOS: short ( 5 days). Information gain algorithm was utilized to select the most relevant attributes. Only attributes with information gain of more than zero were used in model building. Four different machine learning techniques were evaluated and their diagnostic accuracy measures were compared. Setting The dataset of this study included adult patients who were admitted between 2008 and 2016 in King Abdulaziz Cardiac Center (KACC). The center is located in King Abdulaziz Medical City Complex in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. Participants (dataset) A total of 16,414 consecutive inpatient visits for 12,769 unique patients (mean age of 58.8 \u00b1 16 years of which 68.2% were males) between 2008 and 2016 were included. The study cohort had a high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension 56%, diabetes 56%, dyslipidemia 52%, obesity 33% and smoking 24%). The most common admitting diagnosis was acute coronary syndrome (36%). Results The variables with highest impact on the prediction of in-hospital LOS were on admission heart rate, on admission systolic and diastolic blood pressure, age and insurance status (eligibility). Using machine learning models; Random Forest (RF) model outperformed among all other models (sensitivity (0.80), accuracy (0.80), and AUROC (0.94)).

A latent shoeprint is a photograph of the impressions made by a shoe on the surface of its contact. Latent shoeprints can be used for identification of suspects in a forensic case by narrowing down the search space. This is done by elimination of the type of shoe, by matching it against a set of known shoeprints (captured impressions of many different types of shoes on a chemical surface). Manual identification is laborious and hence the domain seeks automated methods. The critical step in automatic shoeprint identification is Shoeprint Extraction - defined as the problem of isolating the shoeprint foreground (impressions of the shoe) from the remaining elements (background and noise). We formulate this problem as a labeling problem as that of labeling different regions of a latent image as foreground (shoeprint) and background. The matching of these extracted shoeprints to the known prints largely depends on the quality of the extracted shoeprint from latent print. The labeling problem is naturally formulated as a machine learning task and in this paper we present an approach using Conditional Random Fields(CRFs) to solve this problem.

This thesis investigates the problem of semantic concept detection in general videos focusing on two advanced directions: multi-concept learning and multi-modality learning. ::: Semantic concept detection refers to the task of assigning an input video sequence one or multiple labels indicating the presence of one or multiple semantic concepts in the video sequence. Much of the prior research work deals with the problem in au isolated manner, i.e., a binary classifier is constructed using feature vectors from the single visual modality to classify whether or not a video contains a specific concept. However, multimedia videos comprise of information from multiple modalities (both visual and audio). Each modality brings sonic information abort the other and their simultaneous processing can uncover relationships that are otherwise unavailable when considering the modalities separately. In addition, real-world semantic concepts do not occur in isolation. The context information is useful for enhancing detection of individual concepts. ::: This thesis explores multi-concept learning and multi-modality learning to improve semantic concept detection in general videos, i.e., videos with general content and are captured in uncontrolled conditions. For multi-concept learning, we propose two methods with the frameworks of two-layer Context-Based Concept Fusion (CBCF) and single-layer multi-label classification, respectively. The first method represents the inter-conceptual relationships by a Conditional Random Field (CRF). The inputs of the CRF are initial detection probabilities from independent, concept detectors. Through inference with concept relations in the CRF we get updated concept detection probabilities as outputs. To avoid the difficulty of designing compatibility potentials in the CRF, a discriminative cost function aiming at class separation is directly-minimized. Also, we further extend this method to study an interesting \"20 questions problem\" for semantic concept detection, where user's interaction is incorporated to annotate a small number of key concepts for each data, which are then used to improve detection of the remaining concepts. To this end, an active CBCF approach is proposed that can choose the most informative concepts for the user to label. The second multi-concept learning method does not explicitly model concept relations but optimizes multi-label discrimination for all concepts over all training data through a single-layer joint boosting algorithm. By sharing \"good' kernels among different concepts, accuracy of individual detectors can be improved; by joint learning of common detectors across different classes, required kernels and computational complexity for detecting individual concepts can be reduced. ::: For multi-modality learning, we develop methods with two strategies: global fusion of features or models from multiple modalities, and construction of the local audio-visual atomic representation to enforce a moderate-level audio-visual synchronization. Two algorithms are developed for global multi-modality fusion, i.e., the late-fusion audio-visual boosted CRF and the early-fusion audio-visual joint boosting. The first method is an extension of the above two-layer CBCF multi-concept learning approach where the inputs of the CRF include independent concept detection probabilities obtained by using both visual and audio features, individually. The second method is an extension of the above single-layer multi-label classification approach; where both visual-based kernels and audio-based kernels are shared by multiple concepts through the joint boosting multi-label concept detector. These two proposed methods naturally combines multi-modality learning and multi-concept learning to exert the power of both for enhancing semantic concept detection. To analyze moderate-level audio-visual synchronization in general videos, we propose to generate a local audio-visual atomic representation, i.e., the Audio-Visual Atom (AVA). We track visually consistent regions in the video sequence to generate visual atoms. At the same time we locate audio onsets in the audio soundtrack to generate audio atoms. Then visual atoms and audio atoms are combined together to form AVAs, on top of which joint audio-visual codebooks are constructed. The audio-visual codebooks capture the co-occurring audio-visual patterns that are representative to describe different individual concepts, and accordingly can improve concept detection. ::: The contributions of this thesis can be summarized as follows. (1) An in-depth study of jointly detecting multiple concepts in general domains, where concept relationships are hard to compute. (2) The first system to explore the \"20 questions\" problem for semantic concept detection, by incorporating users' interactions and taking into account joint detection of multiple concepts. (3) An in-depth investigation of combining audio and visual information to enhance detecting generic concepts. (4) The first system to explore the localized joint audio-visual atomic representation for concept detection, under challenging conditions in general domains.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2279041258", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["173173678", "6997659"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:61217704"}

Such attacks usually result in significant damage to the organization, such as the loss and/or leakage of sensitive and confidential information. Because email communication is an integral part of daily business operations, attackers frequently leverage email as an attack vector in order to initially penetrate the targeted organization. Email message allows the attacker to deliver dangerous content to the victim, such as malicious attachments or links to malicious websites. Existing email analysis solutions analyze only specific parts of the email using rule-based methods, while other important parts remain unanalyzed. Existing anti-virus engines primarily use signature-based detection methods, and therefore are insufficient for detecting new unknown malicious emails. Machine learning methods have been shown to be effective at detecting maliciousness in various domains and particularly in email. Previous works which used machine learning methods suggested sets of features which offer a limited perspective over the whole email message. In this paper, we propose a novel set of general descriptive features extracted from all email components (header, body, and attachments) for enhanced detection of malicious emails using machine learning methods. The proposed features are extracted just from the email itself; therefore, our features are independent, since the extraction process does not require an Internet connection or the use of external services or other tools, thereby meeting the needs of real-time detection systems. We conducted an extensive evaluation of our new novel features against sets of features suggested by previous academic work using a collection of 33,142 emails which contains 38.73% malicious and 61.27% benign emails. The results show that malicious emails can be detected effectively when using our novel features with machine learning algorithms. Moreover, our novel features enhance the detection of malicious emails when used in conjunction with features suggested by related work. The Random Forest classifier achieved the highest detection rates, with an AUC of 0.929, true positive rate (TPR) of 0.947, and false positive rate (FPR) of 0.03.

Using a subset of these proteins, we built diagnostic classifiers that can be used to distinguish Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) patients from Normal controls (NC). ::: Design/Methods: An aptamer-based screen was used to quantify the levels of 1129 proteins in the blood of PD patients and Normal controls. After preprocessing and quality control, 968 proteins were quantified in 96 PD and 45 NC samples. To identify proteins that had significantly different concentrations in PD versus NC samples, univariate tests of significance were performed including the Mann-Whitney U-test (non-parametric), Student\u2019s t-test (parametric), and permutation test (10,000 resamples). Linear models associating protein concentration with disease state were run for all 968 proteins, adjusting for Levodopa Equivalent Daily Dose (LEDD), age at plasma collection, and gender. The univariate tests of significance and the linear models identified many significant proteins (p<0.001), which represent candidate diagnostic biomarkers. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed colinearity among the candidate biomarkers, suggesting we can reduce them down to a smaller set of proteins that can be used for a diagnostic panel. Stability selection,a meta-statistical tool that identifies consistently important features by repeated subsampling, was used to rank proteins by importance. Support Vector Machine, Partial Least Squares Determinant Analysis and Logistic Regression-based classifiers were built using the Stability Selection ranked biomarkers. A stratified bootstrapping approach for cross-validation (using ~2:1 training to testing ratio) was used to assess classifier performance. ::: Conclusion/Results: We identified biomarker panels composed of ~10-15 proteins that can be used to distinguish PD patients from NC with high accuracy (Area Under the Curve>0.85). This work also represents a bioinformatics pipeline for the development of useful biomarker panels from large-scale unbiased screening methods. Disclosure: Dr. Liu has nothing to disclose.

Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were implemented to estimate the content of this heavy metal from hyperspectral imaging and chemical analysis. Competitive Adaptive Reweighted Sampling Method (CARS) and Jackknife method were used for selecting optimal wavelength. The SVR model performed satisfactorily with the use of 45 resulting wavelengths from optimization using CARS and the Jackknife method, with an adjusted coefficient for the test R2 of 0.9401 and an RMSEP of 0.2594.

By spreading images to others, it can help other people finding recommended food when visiting the same place. One way to tackle this problem is by identifying food images automatically. In this paper, we propose a new method for recognizing traditional foods in Indonesia. There are 382 images taken using smartphone camera, consisting of 33 classes as training set and 33 images as testing set. All features are extracted using color moments in RGB, LAB, and HSV color spaces and texture feature of Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). Random Forest Classifier with different number of estimators are used to evaluate the proposed method. The result of combined features consisting of color and texture features reaches 93.5% of accuracy using 500 estimators.

The heterogeneous quality of available topographic information (i.e. higher resolution digital elevation model only for a sub-region) encouraged to confront modelling results based on two different study area delineations and two raster resolutions. Input data was based on the larger modelling region L15 (163 km2) and smaller S (70 km2; located inside L15) with an associated raster cell size of 15 m (region L15 and S15) and 5 m (region S5). The resulting three data sets (L15, S15 and S5) were included into three differently flexible modelling techniques (Generalized Linear Model - GLM, General Additive Model - GAM, Support Vector Machine-SVM) to produce nine landslide susceptibility models. Preceding variable selection was performed heuristically and supported by an exploratory data analysis. The final models were based on the explanatory variables slope angle, slope aspect, lithology, relative slope position, elevation, convergence index, distance to streams, distance to springs and topographic wetness index. The ability of the models to classify independent test data was elaborated using a k-fold cross validation procedure and the AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic) metric. In general, all produced landslide susceptibility maps depicted the hillslopes of the ravines, which cut the pyroclastic ramp, as prone to landsliding. The modelling results showed that predictive performances (i.e. AUROC values) slightly increased with an increasing flexibility of the applied modelling technique. Thus, SVM performed best, while the GAM outperformed the GLM. This tendency was most distinctive when modelling with the largest landslide sample size (i.e. data set L15; n = 662 landslides). Non-linear classifiers (GAMs, SVMs) performed slightly better when trained on the basis of lower raster resolution (data set S15) compared to the 5 m counterparts (data set S5). Highest predictive performance was obtained for the model based on data set L15 and the SVM classifier (median AUROC: 0.82). However, SVMs also indicated the highest degree of model overfitting. This study indicates that the decision to delineate a study area, the selection of a raster resolution as well as the chosen classification technique can affect varying aspects of subsequent modelling results. The results do not support the assumption that a higher raster resolution (i.e. a more detailed digital representation of the terrain) inevitably leads to better performing or geomorphically more plausible landslide susceptibility maps.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11629-018-5225-6", "venue": "Journal of Mountain Science", "journal": "Journal of Mountain Science", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2922389999", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["129508225", "22422912", "129902482", "7532260", "128406361", "129592030", "52083889", "128813264", "59485862", "129722526", "20572432", "127637235", "129336839", "27978898", "27498896", "129091243", "128699210", "10414274", "46138617", "128557489", "140630882", "20666728", "129922991", "128402672", "2708071", "126040243", "55458844", "198489226", "131478535", "129989406", "129214481", "47128183", "128767904", "128689389", "14356434", "56020368", "53309593", "53577488", "135441161", "140609949", "135360387", "129498347", "34428510", "133661531", "4623736", "126220940", "131229499", "52086765", "55037406", "129579297", "118539251", "129238101", "28637672", "128645072", "85161393", "41919870", "140172860", "3926716"], "inbound_citations": ["214793983"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134779022"}

The experimental results showed that the method does indeed facilitate the modeling of web navigation, which was not possible with the existing web usage mining methods. However, a content-based recommendation model is shown to still outperform the proposed method, which suggests that the knowledge of the navigation sequence does not contribute to the recommendation process.

However, many existing large multisite studies forgo their acquisition in favor of other MRI sequences due to economic and time constraints. ::: ::: Methods ::: In this article, we have investigated whether FLAIR and T2w/PD sequences are necessary to detect WMHs in Alzheimer's and aging studies, compared to using only T1w images. Using a previously validated automated tool based on a Random Forests classifier, WMHs were segmented for the baseline visits of subjects from ADC, ADNI1, and ADNI2/GO studies with and without T2w/PD and FLAIR information. The obtained WMH loads (WMHLs) in different lobes were then correlated with manually segmented WMHLs, each other, age, cognitive, and clinical measures to assess the strength of the correlations with and without using T2w/PD and FLAIR information. ::: ::: Results ::: The WMHLs obtained from T1w-Only segmentations correlated with the manual WMHLs (ADNI1: r = .743, p < .001, ADNI2/GO: r = .904, p < .001), segmentations obtained from T1w + T2w + PD for ADNI1 (r = .888, p < .001) and T1w + FLAIR for ADNI2/GO (r = .969, p < .001), age (ADNI1: r = .391, p < .001, ADNI2/GO: r = .466, p < .001), and ADAS13 (ADNI1: r = .227, p < .001, ADNI2/GO: r = .190, p < 0.001), and NPI (ADNI1: r = .290, p < .001, ADNI2/GO: r = 0.144, p < .001), controlling for age. ::: ::: Conclusion ::: Our results suggest that while T2w/PD and FLAIR provide more accurate estimates of the true WMHLs, T1w-Only segmentations can still provide estimates that hold strong correlations with the actual WMHLs, age, and performance on various cognitive/clinical scales, giving added value to datasets where T2w/PD or FLAIR are not available.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "29181872", "doi": "10.1002/hbm.23894", "venue": null, "journal": "Human Brain Mapping", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2770385342", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Psychology"], "outbound_citations": ["23638086", "13042646", "215703877", "27491506", "8026836", "15917446", "23564764", "14293987", "5180624", "1939828", "2912111", "1419413", "207003674", "13922926", "25124335", "3688318", "38513958", "17330036", "21374462", "34948139", "27010799", "29495563", "27006824", "12635906", "1686106", "17408528", "2995286", "37422780", "45054155", "46845888"], "inbound_citations": ["207844828", "46845888", "202853423", "208576686", "208595540", "207895575", "196651285", "52846192", "4379130"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:46845888"}

To address the problem, the paper proposes an attention based joint model with negative sampling. It combines a sequence tagger with a classifier by an attention mechanism. The tagger helps in identifying slot values in raw texts and the classifier simultaneously maps them into standard slot values or the symbol of new values.

The main aim of this study is to explore potential applications of two new models such as two-class Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) and Alternating Decision Tree (ADT) for landslide susceptibility mapping at the Yihuang area (China). The ADT has not been used in landslide susceptibility modeling and this paper attempts a novel application of this technique. For the purpose of comparison, a conventional method of Support Vector Machines (SVM) which has been widely used in the literature was included and their results were assessed. At first, a landslide inventory map with 187 landslide locations for the study area was constructed from various sources. Landslide locations were then spatially randomly split in a ratio of 70/30 for building landslide models and for the model validation. Then a spatial database with a total of fourteen landslide conditioning factors was prepared, including slope, aspect, altitude, topographic wetness index (TWI), stream power index (SPI), sediment transport index (STI), plan curvature, landuse, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), lithology, distance to faults, distance to rivers, distance to roads, and rainfall. Using the KLR, the SVM, and the ADT, three landslide susceptibility models were constructed using the training dataset. The three resulting models were validated and compared using the receive operating characteristic (ROC), Kappa index, and five statistical evaluation measures. In addition, pairwise comparisons of the area under the ROC curve were carried out to assess if there are significant differences on the overall performance of the three models. The goodness-of-fits are 92.5% (the KLR model), 88.8% (the SVM model), and 95.7% (the ADT model). The prediction capabilities are 81.1%, 84.2%, and 93.3% for the KLR, the SVM, and the ADT models, respectively. The result shows that the ADT model yielded better overall performance and accurate results than the KLR and SVM models. The KLR model considered slightly better than SVM model in terms of the positive prediction values. The ADT and KLR are the two promising data mining techniques which might be considered to use in landslide susceptibility mapping.

In this paper, we propose a real-time recognizer of ASL based on a mobile platform, so that it will have more accessibility and provides an ease of use. The technique implemented is Transfer Learning of new data of Hand gestures for alphabets in ASL to be modelled on various pre-trained high- end models and optimize the best model to run on a mobile platform considering the various limitations of the same during optimization. The data used consists of 27,455 images of 24 alphabets of ASL.

As opposed to similar algorithms, the size of the solution obtained by OISVMs is always bounded, implying a bounded testing time.

A comparison between genetic programming and classical optimization techniques in the construction of visual spaces using large haptic datasets, is provided.

We establish four target classes, i.e., pre-eruptive, lava fountains, eruptive, and post-eruptive.

Introduction Machine or statistical learning is a growing \ufb01eld that encompasses many scienti\ufb01c problems includ- ing estimating parameters from data, identifying risk factors in health studies, image recognition, and \ufb01nding clusters within datasets, to name just a few examples. In the recent book on statistical learning by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman [9], they describe this \ufb01eld as \u201clearning from data\u201d, with the goal of making a prediction of some outcome of interest. This prediction is usually made on the basis of a computer model that is built using data where the outcomes and a set of features have been previously matched. The computer model is called a learner, hence the name machine learning. In this paper, we present two such algorithms and compare their predictive power on three supernova type 1a data sets provided by the Nearby Supernova Factory [1]. The general form of a machine learning problem can be described as follows: given a set of training data {x i , y i } N where each x i \u2208 n is an observation with a set of n attributes, each y i is the ith observation\u2019s response, and N is the number of observations, \ufb01nd a mapping that will predict the response y. That is, the goal is to produce a function F (x) that minimizes the risk over all future predictions de\ufb01ned as: R R(F (x)) = E xy L(y, F (x)), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, 1 Cyclotron Road, Mail Stop 50B-4230, Berkeley, CA 94720, JCMeza@lbl.gov; Supported in part by the Director, O\ufb03ce for Advanced Scienti\ufb01c Computing Research, Division of Computational Science Research and Partnerships(SciDAC) of the U.S. Department of Energy, under contract number DE-AC02-05CH11231.

Accordingly, this work explores how to make quality of ultrasonic B-mode images from 32 channels approaching to that from 128 channels by using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Based on the concepts of auto-encoder, context encoder, semi-supervised latent-class learning, and context-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), we develop the Context Encoder Reconstruction GAN (CER-GAN)., which adopts the contour learning mechanism to establish the relationship between 32-channel and 128-channel Point Spread Functions (PSF) via the mini-batch training. In our experiments, 20 pairs of 32 and 128-channel ultrasound images were used where the way of \u201cleave one person out\u201d was employed for cross-validation. Our CER-GAN automatically encodes 32-channel PSF blocks, and generates pseudo 128-channel PSF ones which are matched with real 128-channel ones to obtain discrimination and amendment from the adversarial mechanism. Finally, these pseudo blocks are used to yield an improved image. The experimental results reveal that the proposed CER-GAN outperforms the conventional DNNs. In Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM), the minimum distinguishable pixel lengths from the 32-channel, CER-GAN, and 128-channel images are 13.34, 11.15, and 8.62, respectively.

The reason of the favorable scores from CER-GAN is that the background speckle noise is lowered to some extent.

Secondly, through multiple consecutive spectral analysis procedures, the proposed network can learn more clustering-friendly representations and is capable to reveal the deep correlations among data samples.

In multiagent learning, concurrent multiple distributed learning processes can make the learning environment non-stationary for each individual learner. Developing an efficient learning approach to coordinate age nts' behaviors in this dynamic environment is a difficult problem, especial ly when agents do not know the domain structure and have only local observability of the environment. In this paper, a coordinated multiagent learning approach is proposed to enable agents to learn efficient coor dinated behaviors by exploiting agent independence in loosely coupled multiagent systems. The main feature of the proposed approach is to explicitly quantify and dynamically adapt agent independence during learning so that agents can make a trade-off between a single-agent learning process and a coordinated learning process for an efficient decision making. The proposed approach is employed to solve two-robot navigation problems in different scales of domains.

Training data comprised a set of SPOT-5 reflectance values each associated with an individual value of subpixel imperviousness as their respective labels. The latter were obtained on the basis of a land cover map, which in turn was derived from a pansharpened QB subset by means of an object-oriented image classification approach. In addition, by varying different sets of training data in the model building process the spectral interrelationships between the urban land cover classes (water, bare soil, vegetation, and impervious surface) and their effect on the estimation of subpixel imperviousness could be examined. In order to exclude irrelevant areas (natural/undeveloped land) from the impervious surface estimation process, single-polarised TerraSAR-X data were used to delineate settlement areas by an object-oriented image classification approach. Furthermore, a change detection method was applied for the respective time period in order to test the suitability of the approach for the automated detection of structural developments within the urban topography. Settlement areas were correctly identified with overall accuracies between 81% and 94%, whilst the comparison of the modelled impervious estimates to the training values gave an absolute mean error below 15%.

Since early diagnosis could improve treatment outcomes and longer survival times for breast cancer patients, it is significant to develop breast cancer detection techniques. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can extract features from images automatically and then perform classification. To train the CNN from scratch, however, requires a large number of labeled images, which is infeasible for some kinds of medical image data such as mammographic tumor images. In this paper, we proposed two solutions to the lack of training images. 1)To generate synthetic mammographic images for training by the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Adding GAN generated images made to train CNN from scratch successful and adding more GAN images improved CNN\u2019s validation accuracy to at most (best) 98.85%. 2)To apply transfer learning in CNN. We used the pre-trained VGG-16 model to extract features from input mammograms and used these features to train a Neural Network (NN)-classifier. The stable average validation accuracy converged at about 91.48% for classifying abnormal vs. normal cases in the DDSM database. Then, we combined the two deep-learning based technologies together. That is to apply GAN for image augmentation and transfer learning in CNN for breast cancer detection. To the training set including real and GAN augmented images, although transfer learning model did not perform better than the CNN, the speed of training transfer learning model was about 10 times faster than CNN training. Adding GAN images can help training avoid over-fitting and image augmentation by GAN is necessary to train CNN classifiers from scratch. On the other hand, transfer learning is necessary to be applied for training on pure real images. To apply GAN to augment training images for training CNN classifier obtained the best classification performance.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.2512671", "venue": "Medical Imaging", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2935232351", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["39756729", "2390912", "9263402", "13666575", "5108612", "207763512", "3333267", "5955557", "125696306", "1033682", "25931462", "1082740", "6704804", "211227", "10804187", "21282813", "13688414", "6389527", "37149", "32710", "6383532", "1226440", "9560434", "3767412", "9382114", "68362967", "933212", "8375616", "9602454", "23363764", "32311697", "7609105", "9623929", "46764434", "34944081", "6577553", "14124313", "52829548", "15539264", "6844431", "6628106", "5707386", "11758569", "44061981", "957723", "31464468", "9546541", "2119244", "13290575", "16628328", "30962846", "384205", "10328909", "206593880", "206594692", "1023605"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:133360110"}

This paper reports on a comparative study which investigates the effectiveness of multiple approaches operating on GMM mean supervectors, including support vector machines and various forms of regression. Firstly, we demonstrate a method by which supervector regression can be used to produce a forensic likelihood ratio. Then, three variants of solving the regression problem are considered, namely least squares and l ::: 1 and l ::: 2 norm minimization solutions. Comparative analysis of these techniques, combined with four different scoring methods, reveals that supervector regression can provide a substantial relative improvement in both validity (up to 75.3%) and reliability (up to 41.5%) over both Gaussian Mixture Model - Universal Background Models (GMM-UBMs) and Gaussian Mixture Model - Support Vector Machine (GMM-SVM) results when evaluated on two studio clean forensic speech databases. Under mismatched/noisy conditions, more modest relative improvements in both validity (up to 41.5%) and reliability (up to 12.1%) were obtained relative to GMM-SVM results. From a practical standpoint, the analysis also demonstrates that supervector regression can be more effective than GMM-UBM or GMM-SVM in obtaining a higher positive-valued likelihood ratio for same-speaker comparisons, thus improving the strength of evidence if the particular suspect on trial is indeed the offender.

They can cause low prediction accuracy and high computation costs. Active Learning is a technique that employs only a small set of data to construct an initial classification model. Then, it iteratively improves the model by incrementally learning from the misclassified examples. In this paper, we aim to improve prediction accuracy by applying Active Learning. To solve the imbalance issue, the active model was iteratively updated based on the G-mean, and the under sampling sampling was also applied. The proposed algorithm was suitable for large scale data since it did not need to use the whole data set to construct a model. The experiment was conducted on two standard corpuses, one of which contained more than 100,000 examples. The result showed that a prediction performance of standard technique (Neural Network) can be improved by applying the Active Learning strategy for 5%\u201313%.

The identification was carried out on the regulation object (a dryer model) representing the pilot-scale processes occurring during air conditioning and drying. The new approach proposed in the paper is the use of the imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) as a tool for selecting the best parameters for support vector regression (SVR) and for selecting an optimal set of regressors. The advantage of this method is that the selection of an optimal set of regressors and the optimal parameters of SVR for this set is performed automatically, which reduces the time needed for identification. The results of the SVR with the ARX, ARMAX, OE, Box-Jenkins (BJ) and low-order transfer function (Tf) models were compared. The research was conducted for two fan speeds, equal to 40% and 60%. The Fit and MSE indicators for the SVR achieved a higher value with respect to those of the ARX, ARMAX, OE, BJ and Tf models.

We employ the prediction ability of the supervised ML algorithms to build an estimator for the $P(k)$. The estimator is trained on a set of cosmological models, and redshifts for which the $P(k)$ is known, and it learns to predict $P(k)$ for any other set. We review three ML algorithms -- Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines, and K-Nearest Neighbours -- and investigate their prime parameters to optimize the prediction accuracy of the estimator. We also compute an optimal size of the training set, which is realistic enough, and still yields high accuracy. We find that, employing the optimal values of the internal parameters, a set of $50-100$ cosmological models is enough to train the estimator that can predict the $P(k)$ for a wide range of cosmological models, and redshifts. Using this configuration, we build a blackbox -- Supervised Estimator for Matter Power Spectrum (SEMPS) -- that computes the $P(k)$ to 5-10$\\%$ accuracy up to $k\\sim 10 h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ with respect to the reference model (cosmic emulator). We also compare the estimations of SEMPS to that of the Halofit, and find that for the $k$-range where the cosmic variance is low, SEMPS estimates are better than that of the Halofit. The predictions of the SEMPS are instantaneous in the sense that it can evaluate up to 500 $P(k)$ in less than one second, which makes it ideal for many applications like visualisations, weak lensing, emulations, likelihood analysis etc..

The approach towards this research is by using K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the machine learning classifiers. Firstly, each of the participants will be required to wear the EEG headset to record their brain waves when they are immersed inside the VR environment. The data points are then marked if they showed any physical signs of emotion or by observing the brain wave pattern. Secondly, the data will then be tested and trained with KNN and SVM algorithms. We conduct subject-dependent as well as subject-independent classifications in order to compare intra-against inter-subject variability, respectively in VR EEG-based emotion modeling.

The main aspect of the lens system design methodology is the optimization procedure. Since optimization is a complex, non-linear task, soft computing optimization algorithms can be used. There are many tools that can be employed to measure optical performance, but the spot diagram is the most useful. The spot diagram gives an indication of the image of a point object. In this paper, the spot size radius is considered an optimization criterion. Intelligent soft computing scheme Support Vector Regression (SVR) is implemented. In this study, the polynomial and radial basis functions (RBF) are applied as the SVR kernel function to estimate the optimal lens system parameters. The performance of the proposed estimators is confirmed with the simulation results. The SVR results are then compared with other soft computing techniques. According to the results, a greater improvement in estimation accuracy can be achieved through the SVR with polynomial basis function compared to other soft computing methodologies. The SVR coefficient of determination R 2 with the polynomial function was 0.9975 and with the radial basis function the R 2 was 0.964. The new optimization methods benefit from the soft computing capabilities of global optimization and multi-objective optimization rather than choosing a starting point by trial and error and combining multiple criteria into a single criterion in conventional lens design techniques.

Methods: The ECG signal is first preprocessed using Stationary Wavelet Transforms (SWT) for noise suppression, signal quality assessment and subsequent R-peak detection. Discrete-state Markov probabilities modelling transitions between successive RR intervals along with other statistical quantities derived from the RR-interval series constitute the feature set to perform AF classification using Random Forests. Further enhancement in AF detection is achieved by using a post-processing false positive suppression algorithm based on autocorrelation analysis of the RR-interval series. Datasets: The AF classifier was trained using the Physionet/Computing in Cardiology 2017 AF Challenge dataset and the Atrial Fibrillation Termination Database (AFTDB). The test datasets consist of the MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database (AFDB) and the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (MITDB). Results: Our algorithms achieved sensitivity, specificity and F-score values of 97.4%, 98.6% and 97.7% respectively on the AFDB dataset and 96.3%, 97.0% and 85.6% respectively on the MITDB dataset. It was also observed that inclusion of the false positive suppression step resulted in a 1.1% increase in specificity and a 4.0% increase in F-score for the MITDB dataset without any decrease in sensitivity.

Regarding the importance of communities, community detection is a fundamental step in the study of social networks typically modeled as large-scale graphs. Detecting communities in such large-scale graphs which generally suffers from the curse of dimensionality is the main objective followed in this study. An efficient modularity-based community detection algorithm called MDPCluster is introduced in order to detect communities in large-scale graphs in a timely manner. To address the high dimensionality problem, first, a Louvain-based algorithm is utilized by MDPCluster to distinguish initial communities as super-nodes and then a Modified Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, called MDPSO is leveraged to detect communities through maximizing modularity measure. MDPSO discretizes Particle Swarm Optimization using the idea of transmission tendency and also escapes from premature convergence thereby a mutation operator inspired by Genetic Algorithm.

Traditional systems are extremely brittle, failing to retrieve relevant documents unless the user's exact search string is found. They support only the most primitive trial-and-error interaction with their users. They are also static; even systems with so-called \"relevance feedback\" are incapable of learning from experience with users. SCALIR (a Symbolic and Connectionist Approach to Legal Information Retrieval), a system for assisting research on copyright law, has been designed to address these problems. By using a hybrid of symbolic and connectionist artificial intelligence techniques, SCALIR develops a conceptual representation of document relationships without explicit knowledge engineering. SCALIR's direct manipulation interface encourages users to browse through the space of documents. The system then uses these browsing patterns to improve its performance by modifying its representation, resulting in a communal repository of expertise for all of its users. ::: SCALIR's representational scheme also mirrors the hybrid nature of the Anglo-American legal system. While certain legal concepts are precise and rule-like, others (which legal scholars call \"open-textured\") are subject to interpretation. The meaning of legal text is established through the parallel and distributed precedence-based judicial appeal system. SCALIR represents documents and terms as nodes in a network; it captures the duality of the legal system by using symbolic (semantic network) and connectionist links. The former correspond to a priori knowledge, such as the fact that one case overturned another on appeal. The latter correspond to statistical inferences, such as the relevance of a term describing a case. SCALIR's text corpus includes all federal cases on copyright law. ::: The hybrid representation also suggests a way to resolve the apparent incompatability between the two prominent paradigms in artificial intelligence, the \"classical\" symbol-manipulation approach and the neurally-inspired connectionist approach.

Arguably, the class of positive semi-definite (psd) kernels, widely known as Mercer's Kernels, constitutes one of the most well-studied cases. For every psd kernel there exists an associated feature map to an arbitrary dimensional Hilbert space mathcal H, the so-called feature space. The main reason behind psd kernels' popularity is the fact that classification/regression techniques (such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs)) and component analysis algorithms (such as Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA)) can be devised in mathcal H, without an explicit definition of the feature map, only by using the kernel (the so-called kernel trick). Recently, due to the development of very efficient solutions for large scale linear SVMs and for incremental linear component analysis, the research towards finding feature map approximations for classes of kernels has attracted significant interest. In this paper, we attempt the derivation of explicit feature maps of a recently proposed class of kernels, the so-called one-shot similarity kernels. We show that for this class of kernels either there exists an explicit representation in feature space or the kernel can be expressed in such a form that allows for exact incremental learning.

This paper proposes a modeling technique based on Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) eliminating disadvantages of backpropagation based on a gradient-based learning rule for the drying of bittim (pistacia terebinthus). The samples for ELM based model are obtained by experimental studies. In experimental studies, the sample mass loss rate as a function time was investigated in different air velocities (0.5 and 1 m/s) and air temperatures (40, 60 and 80\u00b0C) in a designed dryer system. The obtained samples from experiments are used for training and testing of ELM. Further, some parameters of ELM such as type of activation function and the number of hidden neurons are set to obtain the best possible modelling results. The obtained prediction results show that ELM algorithm with tangent sigmoid activation function and 20 hidden neurons is appeared to be most optimal topology since maximum R2 and minimum rms (0.0500) and cov (0.2256) values are obtained.

This approach is a form of transfer learning, and allows very deep networks to achieve outstanding performance even when a small target dataset is available. It is thought that the bottom layers of the pre-trained network contain general information, which are applicable to different datasets and tasks, while the upper layers of the pre-trained network contain abstract information relevant to a specific dataset and task. While studies have been conducted on the fine-tuning of these layers, the removal of these layers have not yet been considered. This paper explores the effect of removing the upper convolutional layers of a pre-trained network. We empirically investigated whether removing upper layers of a deep pre-trained network can improve performance for transfer learning. We found that removing upper pre-trained layers gives a significant boost in performance, but the ideal number of layers to remove depends on the dataset. We suggest removing pre-trained convolutional layers when applying transfer learning on off-the-shelf pre-trained DCNNs.

They can be used for solving two issues of Accuracy and Efficiency. They solely do have certain disadvantages and advantages which almost completely disappear by combining both concepts. Intrusion detection (ID) is a type of security management system for computers and networks. An ID system gathers and analyzes information from various areas within a computer or a network to identify possible security breaches, which include both intrusions (attacks from outside the organization) and misuse (attacks from within the organization).The CRFs can effectively model such relationships among different features of an observation resulting in higher attack detection accuracy. Another advantage of using CRFs is that every element in the sequence is labelled such that the probability of the entire labelling is maximized, i.e., all the features in the observation collectively determine the final labels. Hence, even if some data is missing, the observation sequence can still be labelled with less number of features. A layered model is to reduce computation and the overall time required to detect anomalous events. The time required to detect an intrusive event is significant and can be reduced by eliminating the communication overhead among different layers. To improve the speed of operation of the system. Hence, we implement the LIDS and select a small set of features for every layer rather than using all the 41 features. This results in significant performance improvement during both the training and the testing of the system. This project presents high attack detection accuracy can be achieved by using CRFs and high efficiency by implementing the Layered Approach.

This paper presents a fall detection method that detects and notifies fall activity in real-time using fog computing. Support Vector Machine based one class classification is used here to build fall detection model. Five features have been calculated from Smartphone accelerometer data to build fall detection model. To implement one class classification, a new method for kernel matrix calculation is proposed here.

We analyse subtle changes in facial expression by recognizing facial muscle action units (AUs) and analysing their temporal behavior. By detecting AUs from face video we enable the analysis of various facial communicative signals including facial expressions of emotion, attitude and mood. For an input video picturing a facial expression we detect per frame whether any of 15 different AUs is activated, whether that facial action is in the onset, apex, or offset phase, and what the total duration of the activation in question is. We base this process upon a set of spatio-temporal features calculated from tracking data for 20 facial fiducial points. To detect these 20 points of interest in the first frame of an input face video, we utilize a fully automatic, facial point localization method that uses individual feature GentleBoost templates built from Gabor wavelet features. Then, we exploit a particle filtering scheme that uses factorized likelihoods and a novel observation model that combines a rigid and a morphological model to track the facial points. The AUs displayed in the input video and their temporal segments are recognized finally by Support Vector Machines trained on a subset of most informative spatio-temporal features selected by AdaBoost.

We proffer a new, efficient deep structured model learning scheme, in which we show how deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be used to directly estimate the messages in message passing inference for structured prediction with Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). With such CNN message estimators, we obviate the need to learn or evaluate potential functions for message calculation. This confers significant efficiency for learning, since otherwise when performing structured learning for a CRF with CNN potentials it is necessary to undertake expensive inference for every stochastic gradient iteration.

{"paper_id": "158156317", "title": "Four essays in quantitative analysis: artificial intelligence and statistical inference", "authors": [{"first": "Arman", "middle": [], "last": "Hassanniakalager", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "This thesis consists of four essays exploring quantitative methods for investment analysis. Chapter 1 is an introduction to the topic where the backgrounds, motivations and contributions of the thesis are discussed. This Chapter proposes an expert system paradigm which accommodates the methodology for all four empirical studies presented in Chapters 2 to 5. ::: In Chapter 2 the profitability of technical analysis and Bayesian Statistics in trading the EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and USD/JPY exchange rates are examined. For this purpose, seven thousand eight hundred forty-six technical rules are generated, and their profitability is assessed through a novel data snooping procedure. Then, the most promising rules are combined with a Naive Bayes (NB), a Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), a Dynamic Model Averaging (DMA), a Dynamic Model Selection (DMS) and a Bayesian regularised Neural Network (BNN) model. The findings show that technical analysis has value in Foreign eXchange (FX) trading, but the profit margins are small. On the other hand, Bayesian Statistics seems to increase the profitability of technical rules up to four times. ::: Chapter 3 introduces the concept of Conditional Fuzzy (CF) inference. The proposed approach is able to deduct Fuzzy Rules (FRs) conditional to a set of restrictions. This conditional rule selection discards weak rules and the generated forecasts are based only on the most powerful ones. In order to achieve this, an RVM is used to extract the most relevant subset of predictors as the CF inputs. Through this process, it is capable of achieving higher forecasting performance and improving the interpretability of the underlying system. The CF concept is applied in a betting application on football games of three main European championships. CF\u2019s performance in terms of accuracy and profitability over the In-Sample (IS) and Out-Of-Sample (OOS) are benchmarked against the single RVM and an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) fed with the same CF inputs and an Ordered Probit (OP) fed with the full set of predictors. The results demonstrate that the CF is providing higher statistical accuracy than its benchmarks, while it is offering substantial profits in the designed betting simulation. ::: Chapter 4 proposes the Discrete False Discovery Rate (DFDR+/-) as an approach to compare a large number of hypotheses at the same time. The presented method limits the probability of having lucky findings and accounts for the dependence between candidate models. The performance of this approach is assessed by backtesting the predictive power of technical analysis in stock markets. A pool of twenty-one thousand technical rules is tested for a positive Sharpe ratio. The surviving technical rules are used to construct dynamic portfolios. Twelve categorical and country-specific Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) indexes are examined over ten years (2006-2015). There are three main findings. First, the proposed method has high power in detecting the profitable trading strategies and the time-related anomalies across the chosen financial markets. Second, the emerging and frontier markets are more profitable than the developed markets despite having higher transaction costs. Finally, for a successful portfolio management, it is vital to rebalance the portfolios on a monthly basis or more frequently. ::: Chapter 5 undertakes an extensive investigation of volatility models for six securities in FX, stock index and commodity markets, using daily one-step-ahead forecasts over five years. A discrete false discovery controlling procedure is employed to study one thousand five hundred and twelve volatility models from twenty classes of Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH), Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), Stochastic Volatility (SV), and Heterogeneous AutoRegressive (HAR) families. The results indicate significant differences in forecasting conditional variance. The most accurate models vary across the three market categories and depend on the study period and measurement scale. Time-varying means, Integrated GARCH (IGARCH) and SV, as well as fat-tailed innovation distributions are the dominant specifications for the outperforming models compared to three benchmarks of ARCH (1), GARCH (1,1), and the volatility pool\u2019s 90th percentile. ::: Finally, Chapter 6 puts together the main findings from the four essays and presents the concluding marks.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2905671561", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:158156317"}

First, CCC resolves the critical issue of label ordering in CC, and therefore reaches more stable performance. Second, CCC matches the task of cost-sensitive multilabel classification, an important problem for satisfying application needs. The cyclic aspect of CCC allows estimating all labels during training, and such estimates makes it possible to embed the cost information into weights of labels. Experimental results justify that cost-sensitive CCC can be superior to state-of-the-art cost-sensitive multilabel classification methods. Third, CCC can be easily coupled with gradient boosting to inherit the advantages of ensemble learning. In particular, gradient boosted CCC efficiently reaches promising performance for both linear and non-linear base learners.

Mapping woody cover over large areas can only be effectively achieved using remote sensing data and techniques. The longest continuously operating Earth-observation program, the Landsat series, is now freely-available as an atmospherically corrected, cloud masked surface reflectance product. The availability and length of the Landsat archive is thus an unparalleled Earth-observation resource, particularly for long-term change detection and monitoring. Here, we map and monitor woody vegetation cover in the Northwest Province of South Africa, an area of more than 100,000 km2 covered by 11 Landsat scenes. We employ a multi-temporal approach with dry-season data from 7 epochs between 1990 to 2015. We use 0.5 m-pixel colour aerial photography to collect > 15,000 point samples for training and validating Random Forest classifications of (i) woody vegetation cover, (ii) other vegetation types (including grasses and agricultural land), and (iii) non-vegetated areas (i.e. urban areas and bare land). Overall accuracies for all years are around 80 % and overall kappa between 0.45 and 0.66. Woody vegetation covers a quarter of the Province and is the most accurately mapped class (balanced accuracies between 0.74-0.84 for the 7 epochs). There is a steady increase in woody vegetation cover over the 25-year-long period of study in the expense of the other vegetation types.

Although the identity of a node can be verified through cryptographic authentication, conventional security approaches are not always desirable because of their overhead requirements. In this paper, I propose to use spatial information, a physical property associated with each node, hard to falsify, and not reliant on cryptography, as the basis for 1) detecting spoofing attacks; 2) determining the number of attackers when multiple adversaries masquerading as the same node identity; and 3) localizing multiple adversaries. I propose to use the spatial correlation of received signal strength (RSS) inherited from wireless nodes to detect the spoofing attacks. I then formulate the problem of determining the number of attackers as a multiclass detection problem. Cluster-based mechanisms are developed to determine the number of attackers. When the training data are available, I explore using the Support Vector Machines (SVM) method to further improve the accuracy of determining the number of attackers. In addition, I developed an integrated detection and localization system that can localize the positions of multiple attackers.

To estimate parameters in Markov Random Field (MRF) based stereo formulations, one usually needs to perform approximate probabilistic inference. Message passing algorithms based on variational methods and belief propagation are widely used for approximate inference in MRFs. Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are discriminative versions of traditional MRFs and have recently been applied to the problem of stereo vision. However, CRF parameter training typically requires expensive inference steps for each iteration of optimization. Inference is particularly slow when there are many discrete disparity levels, due to high state space cardinality. We present a novel CRF for stereo matching with an explicit occlusion model and propose sparse message passing to dramatically accelerate the approximate inference needed for parameter optimization. We show that sparse variational message passing iteratively minimizes the KL divergence between the approximation and model distributions by optimizing a lower bound on the partition function. Our experimental results show reductions in inference time of one order of magnitude with no loss in approximation quality.

Given that the experimental determination of human-virus PPIs is time-consuming and labor-intensive, computational methods are playing an important role in providing testable hypotheses, complementing the determination of large-scale interactome between species. In this work, we applied an unsupervised sequence embedding technique (doc2vec) to represent protein sequences as rich feature vectors of low dimensionality. Training a Random Forest (RF) classifier through a training dataset that covers known PPIs between human and all viruses, we obtained excellent predictive accuracy outperforming various combinations of machine learning algorithms and commonly-used sequence encoding schemes. Rigorous comparison with three existing human-virus PPI prediction methods, our proposed computational framework further provided very competitive and promising performance, suggesting that the doc2vec encoding scheme effectively captures context information of protein sequences, pertaining to corresponding protein-protein interactions. Our approach is freely accessible through our web server as part of our host-pathogen PPI prediction platform ( http://zzdlab.com/InterSPPI/ ).

Zoonotic viruses arise from the animal population as a result of mutations and reassortments, giving rise to novel strains with the capability to evade the host species barrier and cause human infections. Despite progress in understanding interspecies transmission of influenza viruses, we are no closer to predicting zoonotic strains that can lead to an outbreak. We have previously discovered distinct host tropism protein signatures of avian, human and zoonotic influenza strains obtained from host tropism predictions on individual protein sequences. Here, we apply machine learning approaches on the signatures to build a computational model capable of predicting zoonotic strains. The zoonotic strain prediction model can classify avian, human or zoonotic strains with high accuracy, as well as providing an estimated zoonotic risk. This would therefore allow us to quickly determine if an influenza virus strain has the potential to be zoonotic using only protein sequences.

Numerous DDoS attacks, which have been launched against various organizations in the last decade, have had a direct impact on both vendors and users. Many researchers have attempted to tackle the security threat of DDoS attacks by combining classification algorithms with distributed computing. However, their solutions are static in terms of the classification algorithms used. In fact, current DDoS attacks have become so dynamic and sophisticated that they are able to pass the detection system thereby making it difficult for static solutions to detect. In this paper, we propose a dynamic DDoS attack detection system based on three main components: 1) classification algorithms; 2) a distributed system; and 3) a fuzzy logic system. Our framework uses fuzzy logic to dynamically select an algorithm from a set of prepared classification algorithms that detect different DDoS patterns. Out of the many candidate classification algorithms, we use Naive Bayes, Decision Tree (Entropy), Decision Tree (Gini), and Random Forest as candidate algorithms. We have evaluated the performance of classification algorithms and their delays and validated the fuzzy logic system. We have also evaluated the effectiveness of the distributed system and its impact on the classification algorithms delay.

As per the World Health Organization, India has the highest number of pre-term births [ 1 ], with over 3.5 million babies born prematurely, and up to 40 % of them are babies with low birth weights, highly prone to a multitude of diseases such as Jaundice, Sepsis, Apnea, and other Metabolic disorders. Apnea is the primary concern for caretakers of neonates in intensive care units. The real-time medical data is known to be noisy and nonlinear and to address the resultant complexity in classification and prediction of diseases; there is a need for optimizing learning models to maximize predictive performance. Our study attempts to optimize neural network architectures to predict the occurrence of apneic episodes in neonates, after the first week of admission to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). The primary contribution of this study is the formulation and description of a set of generic steps involved in selecting various model-specific, training and hyper-parametric optimization algorithms, as well as model architectures for optimal predictive performance on complex and noisy medical datasets. Methods The data used for the study being inherently complex and noisy, Kernel Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce dataset dimensionality for the analysis such as interpretations and visualization of the dataset. Hyper-parametric and parametric optimization, in different categories, are considered, including learning rate updater algorithms, regularization methods, activation functions, gradient descent algorithms and depth of the network, based on their performance on the validation set, to obtain a holistically optimized neural network, that best model the given complex medical dataset. Deep Neural Network Architectures such as Deep Multilayer Perceptron's, Stacked Auto-encoders and Deep Belief Networks are employed to model the dataset, and their performance is compared to the optimized neural network obtained from the parametric exploration. Further, the results are compared with Support Vector Machine (SVM), K Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms. Results The results indicate that the optimized eight layer Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model, with Adam Decay and Stochastic Gradient Descent (AUC 0.82) can outperform the conventional machine learning models, and perform comparably to the Deep Auto-encoder model (AUC 0.83) in predicting the presence of apnea in neonates. Conclusion The study shows that an MLP model can undergo significant improvements in predictive performance, by the proposed step-wise optimization. The optimized MLP is proved to be as accurate as deep neural network models such as Deep Belief Networks and Deep Auto-encoders for noisy and nonlinear data sets, and outperform all conventional models like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), K Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest (RF) algorithms. The generic nature of the proposed step-wise optimization provides a framework to optimize neural networks on such complex nonlinear datasets.

The major contributions of this paper are: the study and evaluation of the performance of the classifier using three feature extraction techniques and proposal for minimizing the computation time for the classifier. From this study, it is found that the recognition accuracies of 93.33%, 98.67% and 96.67% are achieved for the classifier using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) features, zerocrossing (ZC) and zerocrossing with peak amplitude (ZCPA) features respectively. To reduce the computation time required for the systems, two techniques \u2013 one using optimum threshold technique for the SVM classifier and another using linear assembly are proposed. The ZC based system requires the least computation time and the above techniques reduce the execution time by a factor of 6.56 and 5.95 respectively. For the purpose of comparison, the speech recognition system is also implemented using Altera Cyclone II FPGA with Nios II soft processor and custom instructions. Of the two approaches, the DSP approach requires 87.40% less number of clock cycles. Custom design of the recognition system on the FPGA without using the soft-core processor would have resulted in less computational complexity. The proposed classifier is also found to reduce the number of support vectors by a factor of 1.12\u20133.73 when applied to speaker identification and isolated letter recognition problems.

To achieve real-time online AOID compensation in practice, chaotic particle swarm optimization (CPSO) and the least-squares support vector machine (LSSVM) are combined to construct a predictive AOID model for supersonic aircraft in flight. With its strong global-search capability, the CPSO algorithm is used to optimize the parameters of the LSSVM predictive model. First, a chaotic sequence is used to initialize the particle positions, thereby enhancing search diversity. The premature convergence of normal particle swarm optimization (PSO) is then countered by using CPSO. If PSO falls into a local optimum, the extreme position of the population is adjusted and the current search trajectory of the particles is disturbed so that the particles search new neighborhoods and paths, thereby increasing the probability of escaping the local optimum. The simulation results show that the predictive accuracy of the CPSO-LSSVM model exceeds that of the LSSVM model alone or the back-propagation neural network model. The CPSO-LSSVM model is effective at compensating for AOID within a limited range, and it avoids the disadvantages of traditional geometrical-optics calculations, namely that they are time-consuming, laborious, and error-prone. When the training data of LSSVM is enough, any AOID can be estimated by the CPSO-LSSVM model.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ijleo.2019.163215", "venue": null, "journal": "Optik", "mag_id": "2967388054", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:202123533"}

Several object and facial recognition along with image segmentation tasks have benefited from the non-linear abstraction of hybrid features using CNN. This work presents a novel CNN model parametrization work-flow developed on the cloud-computing platform of Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio (MAMLS) that is capable of learning from the feature maps and classifying multi-modal images with different variabilities using one common flow. This two-step work-flow trains CNN models by splitting the data into training and testing data sets. First, the CNN layers are fixed and the best kernel and normalization parameters that maximize classification accuracy on the test data are identified using grid search. Next, using the best kernel and normalization parameters, the best CNN architecture that maximizes classification accuracy is detected. Finally, the activated feature maps (AFMs) from the parameterized CNN model so far are analyzed to learn new features that can enhance image-based classification accuracies. The proposed flow achieves classification accuracies in the range of 92.5-99.2% that can be further enhanced by doubling the samples based on the features learned from the AFMs. The proposed non-deep CNN models in the MAMLS platform are capable of processing image data sets with 400-4 million samples using a common flow without exponential increase in the computation time. Thus, parametrized non-deep CNN models using the proposed method are capable of identifying novel features that may enhance image-based classification accuracies. For computed tomography (CT) images, quantitative image assessment can allow for benchmarking image processing methods and optimization of image acquisition parameters. Large volumes of CT images from phantoms and patients are analyzed using the CNN models compare to a baseline model that vary in their implementation time complexities. The goal here is to model the data set variability for prediction of CT image quality (CTIQ). We observe that for 70% of data samples in training and 30% data sample in test set, respectively, the average multi-class classification accuracies for CTIQ prediction vary significantly as the data sets are switched from the phantom to patient images. The CNN model is found to be more suitable for CT image texture classification in the absence of structural variabilities. Our analysis demonstrates that CNN models are consistent identifiers of structural similarities for CT image data sets.

We have utilized this dataset to build bitstream perceived quality estimation models based on the Random Forests, Bagging, Deep Learning and Genetic Programming methods. We have taken an empirical approach and have generated models varying from very simple to the most complex depending on the number of features used from the quality dataset. Random Forests and Bagging models have overall generated the most accurate results in terms of RMSE and Pearson correlation coefficient values.

For both approaches, we collected as predictors a comprehensive GIS database of 13 spatial attributes, related to land use, soil type, hydrogeology, topography, climatology, region typology, nitrogen fertiliser application rate, and population density. In this paper, we validate the continental-scale model of groundwater contamination by using a nitrate measurement dataset from three African countries. We discuss the issue of data availability, and quality and scale issues, as challenges in validation. Notwithstanding that the modelling procedure exhibited very good success using a continental-scale dataset (e.g. R2 = 0.97 in the RF format using a cross-validation approach), the continental-scale model could not be used without recalibration to predict nitrate pollution at the country scale using regional data.

It is well known that most of biological agents tend to emit specific fluorescence spectra, which in principle allow their detection and identification, if excited by light of the appropriate wavelength. For these reasons, the detection of the UVLight Induced Fluorescence (UV-LIF) emitted by BAs is particularly promising.

However, it is indeed very challenging due to its sparseness nature. In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing multiLevel Deep Cascade Trees (ldcTree), which is a novel decision tree ensemble approach. It leverages deep cascade structures by stacking Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) to effectively learn feature representation. In addition, we propose to utilize the cross-entropy in each tree of the preceding GBDT as the input feature representation for next level GBDT, which has a clear explanation, i.e., a traversal from root to leaf nodes in the next level GBDT corresponds to the combination of certain traversals in the preceding GBDT. The deep cascade structure and the combination rule enable the proposed ldcTree to have a stronger distributed feature representation ability.

This study compares four tree-based machine learning models for land subsidence hazard modelling at a study area in Hamadan plain (Iran). The study also analyzes the importance of six risk factors including topography (elevation, slope), geomorphology (distance from stream, drainage density), hydrology (groundwater drawdown) and lithology on LS. Thematic layers of each variable related to the LS phenomenon are prepared and utilized as the inputs to the four tree-based machine learning models, including the Rule-Based Decision Tree (RBDT), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), Classification And Regression Tree (CART), and the Random Forest (RF) algorithms to produce a consolidated LS hazard map. The accuracy of the generated maps is then evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the True Skill Statistics (TSS). The RF approach had the lowest predictive error for mapping the LS hazard (i.e., AUC 96.7% for training, AUC 93.8% for validation, TSS 0.912 for training, TSS 0.904 for validation) followed by BRT.

In this paper a new classification technique for hyperspectral data based on synergetics theory is presented. Synergetics \u2013 originally introduced by the physicist H. Haken \u2013 is an interdisciplinary theory to find general rules for pattern formation through selforganization and has been successfully applied in fields ranging from biology to ecology, chemistry, cosmology, and thermodynamics up to sociology. Although this theory describes general rules for pattern formation it was linked also to pattern recognition. Pattern recognition algorithms based on synergetics theory have been applied to images in the spatial domain with limited success in the past, given their dependence on the rotation, shifting, and scaling of the images. These drawbacks can be discarded if such methods are applied to data acquired by a hyperspectral sensor in the spectral domain, as each single spectrum, related to an image element in the hyperspectral scene, can be analysed independently. The classification scheme based on synergetics introduces also methods for spatial regularization to get rid of \"salt and pepper\" classification results and for iterative parameter tuning to optimize class weights. The paper reports an experiment on a benchmark data set frequently used for method comparisons. This data set consists of a hyperspectral scene acquired by the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer AVIRIS sensor of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory acquired over the Salinas Valley in CA, USA, with 15 vegetation classes.

Specifically, we sample some subsets from the original training set and learn metrics across different subsets. In each sampled sub-task, we split the training data into a support set as well as a query set, and learn the set-based distance, instead of sample-based one, to verify the query cell from multiple support cells.

There is active research aimed at identifying automated methodologies able to extract accurate classification indexes from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI). Such indexes should be fit for identifying AD patients as early as possible. Subjects A reference group composed of 144 AD patients and 189 age-matched controls was used to train and test the procedure. It was then applied on a study group composed of 302 MCI subjects, 136 having progressed to clinically probable AD (MCI-converters) and 166 having remained stable or recovered to normal condition after a 24 month follow-up (MCI-non converters). All subjects came from the ADNI database. Methods We sampled the brain with 7 relatively small volumes, mainly centered on the MTL, and 2 control regions. These volumes were filtered to give intensity and textural MRI-based features. Each filtered region was analyzed with a Random Forest (RF) classifier to extract relevant features, which were subsequently processed with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Once a prediction model was trained and tested on the reference group, it was used to compute a classification index (CI) on the MCI cohort and to assess its accuracy in predicting AD conversion in MCI patients. The performance of the classification based on the features extracted by the whole 9 volumes is compared with that derived from each single volume. All experiments were performed using a bootstrap sampling estimation, and classifier performance was cross-validated with a 20-fold paradigm. Results We identified a restricted set of image features correlated with the conversion to AD. It is shown that most information originate from a small subset of the total available features, and that it is enough to give a reliable assessment. We found multiple, highly localized image-based features which alone are responsible for the overall clinical diagnosis and prognosis. The classification index is able to discriminate Controls from AD with an Area Under Curve (AUC) = 0.97 (sensitivity \u2243 89% at specificity \u2243 94%) and Controls from MCI-converters with an AUC = 0.92 (sensitivity \u2243 89% at specificity \u2243 80%). MCI-converters are separated from MCI-non converters with AUC = 0.74(sensitivity \u2243 72% at specificity \u2243 65%). Findings The present automated MRI-based technique revealed a strong relationship between highly localized baseline-MRI features and the baseline clinical assessment. In addition, the classification index was also used to predict the probability of AD conversion within a time frame of two years. The definition of a single index combining local analysis of several regions can be useful to detect AD neurodegeneration in a typical MCI population.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "21718788", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.05.083", "venue": "NeuroImage", "journal": "NeuroImage", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2171225117", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["2827580", "35618138", "22564083", "89141", "1701982", "27109841", "10135518", "206159101", "206787478", "12021113", "628131", "13773133", "5364036", "76020584", "20118415", "7497753", "23760165", "7356809", "6873561", "206341706", "13106463", "7570963", "21792806", "54257822", "20081476", "61649919", "35025503", "18096117", "6884758", "32729340", "783016", "22980679", "13926857", "13088135", "18989541", "118895", "7792652", "20549614", "24096682", "1334013", "10273722", "34710603", "17029533", "20053870", "14352579", "2203289", "18804465", "25116375", "4970283", "10150924", "5558492", "13466517", "23369575", "6006196", "1219753", "207117630", "207158115", "207761262", "1224199", "8615783", "2371388", "9262108", "44602299", "21301242", "120781776"], "inbound_citations": ["7078220", "195065448", "4778884", "206175796", "215604059", "15105147", "20412347", "23616258", "17397861", "212705658", "207828165", "4513154", "39341953", "215251657", "131893884", "207203830", "211234372", "4477042", "155108210", "53084332", "629949", "3254444", "4692717", "18043736", "215634661", "197680777", "211063330", "139101941", "201831539", "211019669", "9491093", "50782262", "27549034", "274395", "34611602", "16332495", "201137828", "53095201", "1371338", "7146248", "27911151", "53766282", "16630075", "27990147", "214968338", "58569268", "16810802", "195259956", "22415439", "58630899", "52898765", "7068752", "167209959", "15422201", "12683361", "22256730"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15215781"}

The diagnostic of human breast cancer is an intricate process and specific indicators may produce negative results. In order to avoid misleading results, accurate and reliable diagnostic system for breast cancer is indispensable. Recently, several interesting machine-learning (ML) approaches are proposed for prediction of breast cancer. To this end, we developed a novel classifier stacking based evolutionary ensemble system \"Can-Evo-Ens\" for predicting amino acid sequences associated with breast cancer. In this paper, first, we selected four diverse-type of ML algorithms of Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest as base-level classifiers. These classifiers are trained individually in different feature spaces using physicochemical properties of amino acids. In order to exploit the decision spaces, the preliminary predictions of base-level classifiers are stacked. Genetic programming (GP) is then employed to develop a meta-classifier that optimal combine the predictions of the base classifiers. The most suitable threshold value of the best-evolved predictor is computed using Particle Swarm Optimization technique. Our experiments have demonstrated the robustness of Can-Evo-Ens system for independent validation dataset. The proposed system has achieved the highest value of Area Under Curve (AUC) of ROC Curve of 99.95% for cancer prediction. The comparative results revealed that proposed approach is better than individual ML approaches and conventional ensemble approaches of AdaBoostM1, Bagging, GentleBoost, and Random Subspace.

Syntactic and semantic recognition of these sentence types are crucially important in computational linguistics although there has not been any significant work towards this end. This thesis, in an attempt to fill this evident gap, is on identifying and assigning semantic categories of Turkish existential sentences in print. Existential sentences in Turkish are minimally characterized by the two existential particles var, meaning there is/are, and yok, meaning there is/are no. In addition to these most basic meanings, other senses of existential particles are possible, which can be categorized into groups such as case existentials and possession existentials. Our system does shallow semantic parsing in defining the predicate-argument relationships in an existential sentence on a word-byword basis, via utilizing Support Vector Machines, after which it proceeds with the semantic categorization of the whole sentence. For both of these tasks, our system produces promising results, in terms of accuracy and precision/recall, respectively.

Almost all of researches focused on some specific features but didn\u2019t present any reasons for that. Therefore, the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is employed to calculate walking stability, an adaptive Genetic Algorithm (GA) to search the best contributing and representative features, and an improved Support Vector Machine (SVM) to assess the fitness of specific feature combination according to age classification information.

This paper improves an existing method based on spatio-temporal probabilistic risk functions. The spatial probabilistic characterization uses geo-referenced information of criminal incidents related to public services to approximate a risk function based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The temporal characterization is supported by Importance Sampling methods and Neural Gas theory to incorporate the information from new measurements, in a recursive manner, updating the spatial probabilistic risk function. Finally, we propose a prediction scheme for criminal activity that also uses Neural Gas Theory, in conjunction with hypothetical future criminal events sampled from a GMM that characterizes the spatial distribution associated with recent criminal activity.

Next, we present our three novel text mining techniques: (i) text association mining with cross-sentence inference, (ii) structure-based document model, and (iii) multi-relational text mining. Our techniques emphasize novel hypothesis generation, document representation and multi-relational discovery, respectively. In the text association mining with cross-sentence inference, statistical co-occurrences of terms and syntactic sentence structure analysis are initially used to find associations among key terms in documents. Subsequently, potential novel hypotheses are derived from the discovered associations. In a different way, the structure-based document model introduces two novel document representations for text documents that take into account not only term frequencies and patterns of term occurrences, but also the document's structural information. Based on the experimental results, our structure-based document models are superior to existing non-structure-based ones. Finally, the multi-relational text mining enhances a literature-based discovery method with multi-relational data mining and Inductive Logic Programming. It is aimed to discover relational knowledge in forms of frequent relational patterns and relational association rules from disjoint sets of literatures. These relational patterns and rules are complementary to the indirect connections found by existing literature-based discovery, and can be used for exploratory research.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2279508762", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["14484409", "11844866"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62347236"}

Previous works, considered combining, per AU, a discriminative frame-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a dynamic generative Hidden Markov Models (HMM), to detect the presence of the AU in question and its temporal segments in an input image sequence. The major drawback of HMMs, is that they do not model well time dependent dynamics as the ones of AUs, especially when dealing with spontaneous expressions. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we exploit efficient duration modeling of the temporal behavior of AUs, and we propose hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) and variable duration semi-Markov model (VDHMM) to recognize the dynamics of AU's. Such models allow the parameterization and inference of the AU's state duration distributions. Within our system, geometrical and appearance based measurements, as well as their first derivatives, modeling both the dynamics and the appearance of AUs, are applied to pair-wise SVM classifiers for a frame-based classification. The output of which are then fed as evidence to the HSMM or VDHMM for inferring AUs temporal phases. A thorough investigation into the aspect of duration modeling and its application to AU recognition through extensive comparison to state-of-art SVM-HMM approaches are presented. For comparison, an average recognition rate of 64.83 % and 64.66 % is achieved for the HSMM and VDHMM respectively. Our framework has several benefits: (1) it models the AU's temporal phases duration; (2) it does not require any assumption about the underlying structure of the AU events, and (3) compared to HMM, the proposed HSMM and VDHMM duration models reduce the duration error of the temporal phases of an AU, and they are especially better in recognizing the offset ending of an AU.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11042-014-2320-8", "venue": "Multimedia Tools and Applications", "journal": "Multimedia Tools and Applications", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1987715128", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["8836118", "2211016", "16115298", "12238413", "14272345", "14122526", "12915390", "6979817", "8196379", "142679654", "62289168", "62282319", "6644398", "41012046", "45256282", "2958333", "15124833", "12279619", "16260193", "17336725", "108304335", "10152907", "56563878", "13618539", "6309334", "17009299", "1969798", "45733094", "5647645", "16083666", "18544245", "18513724", "16075056", "1483488", "15617948"], "inbound_citations": ["47589184", "47589184", "208334116", "207961284", "15351427", "18555770"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12268089"}

Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) as a key element of process monitoring, needs to be investigated because of its essential role in decision making processes. Among available FDD methods, data driven approaches are currently receiving increasing attention because of their relative simplicity in implementation. Regardless of FDD types, one of the main traits of reliable FDD systems is their ability of being updated while new conditions that were not considered at their initial training appear in the process. These new conditions would emerge either gradually or abruptly, but they have the same level of importance as in both cases they lead to FDD poor performance. ::: For addressing updating tasks, some methods have been proposed, but mainly not in research area of chemical engineering. They could be categorized to those that are dedicated to managing Concept Drift (CD) (that appear gradually), and those that deal with novel classes (that appear abruptly). The available methods, mainly, in addition to the lack of clear strategies for updating, suffer ::: from performance weaknesses and inefficient required time of training, as reported. ::: Accordingly, this thesis is mainly dedicated to data driven FDD updating in chemical processes. The proposed schemes for handling novel classes of faults are based on unsupervised methods, while for coping with CD both supervised and unsupervised updating frameworks have been investigated. Furthermore, for enhancing the functionality of FDD systems, some major methods of data processing, including imputation of missing values, feature selection, and feature extension have been investigated. ::: The suggested algorithms and frameworks for FDD updating have been evaluated through different benchmarks and scenarios. As a part of the results, the suggested algorithms for supervised handling CD surpass the performance of the traditional incremental learning in regard to MGM score (defined dimensionless score based on weighted F1 score and training time) even up to 50% improvement. This improvement is achieved by proposed algorithms that detect and forget redundant information as well as properly adjusting the data window for timely updating and retraining the fault detection system. Moreover, the proposed unsupervised FDD updating framework for dealing with novel faults in static and dynamic process conditions achieves up to 90% in terms of the NPP score (defined dimensionless score based on number of the correct predicted class of samples).

Standard methods for feature selection in machine learning seldom take into account the domain knowledge associated with the data. Multitemporal crop classification studies with full-polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data ought to consider the changes in the scattering mechanisms with their phenological growth stages. Hence, it is desirable to incorporate these changes while determining a feature subset for classification. In this study, a random forest (RF) based feature selection technique is proposed that takes into account the changes in the physical scattering mechanism with crop phenological stages for multitemporal PolSAR classification. The partial probability plot, which is an attribute of RF, provides information about the marginal effect of a polarimetric parameter on the desired crop class. Moreover, it is used to identify the specific range of a parameter where the probability of the presence of a particular crop class is high. The proposed technique identifies features that change significantly with crop phenology. The selected features are the ones whose ranges show maximum separation amongst crop classes. Additionally, the feature subset is refined by eliminating correlated features. The E-SAR L -band dataset of the AgriSAR-2006 campaign over the Demmin test site in Germany is used in this study. The classification accuracy using the novel feature selection technique is 99.12%.

In this paper, 22 kinds of features which are related to cost are extracted, then we use Kernel Principal Component Analysis to fuse features which are less relevant to the cost. Then 11-dimensional features are put into RSVRs for modeling. From the theoretical point of view, RSVRs gives a novel work flow that is fusing features with low correlation firstly and then performing regression. In order to avoid the defects of the regression method, the two methods are fused, so that each method can maximize its advantages and make up for the disadvantages of the other method. From a practical point of view, RSVRs can be used to predict the project cost, which not only improves the accuracy, but also immediately obtains the predicted result. As long as the appropriate training data is selected, the method can predict the cost of any area and any building.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s12205-019-0336-3", "venue": null, "journal": "KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering", "mag_id": "2909953306", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:115969421"}

The epipolarity guides the process. The similarity and uniqueness are mapped once again through the Support Vector Machines, but under a different way to the previous case; after this an initial disparity map is obtained.

This can be achieved by machine learning; by building a model contains all possible attributes features of the text.

Despite its conceptual simplicity, we show empirically that with the simple solution -- image mixture, we can learn more robust visual representations from the transformed input, and the benefits of representations learned from this space can be inherited by the linear classification and downstream tasks.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2003.05438", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3012410440", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["173990164", "49865868", "199552270", "211096730", "212633993", "9854876", "196208260", "23714201", "9062671", "473729", "84591", "195820291", "3244218", "4246903", "4009713", "1033682", "15816723", "8281592", "207930212", "206771194", "54445469", "162168848", "52055130", "59292019", "141477988", "10716717", "206771220", "14113767", "12640199", "208617491", "187547", "7275771", "4358477", "49670925", "202786778", "10328909", "2930547", "14124313", "206593880", "189762205", "13756489", "59604501", "207168299", "17804904", "4591284", "102350974", "152282661", "3162051", "50698", "9658690", "60441280", "2035600", "88523028"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212657636"}

A generative classifier is produced using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), model parameters of which are iteratively optimized with Expectation-Maximization (EM).

Hypothesis Acoustical signatures of VADs can provide substantial information regarding PT. Methods We included 10 patients (6 axial, 4 centrifugal VADs) presenting with pump power elevations and recurrent abnormal hemolysis markers consistent with suspected PT. VAD sounds were recorded multiple times using a digital stethoscope (EKO Core) at baseline or before developing thrombosis (normal baseline), during thrombosis episodes and after treatment with heparin or tissue plasminogen activator (Fig. (a)). The 2 types of pumps were analyzed separately (42 recordings from axial and 30 recordings from centrifugal) using 3 steps: (1) Extracting features (time-frequency, acoustic and nonlinearity features) from each recording; (2) Feature importance ranking using Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to evaluate which features were most relevant for distinguishing among different states; (3) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and 2D visualization (Fig. (b)). Results We found that separation among the different states is achieved using the combination of XGBoost feature importance ranking and PCA (Fig. (c)). The suggested pipeline of analysis can overcome the problems emerging from inter-subject variability. In both pumps, sounds recorded from VADs with PT had different signatures than baseline sounds. Better separation was observed for axial pumps relative to centrifugal pumps, which may be due to the difference in operating speeds (average 9400 vs 2600 rpms, respectively). We observed a slight overlap between the post treatment and baseline episodes, suggesting the possible presence of residual PT that is not identified by hemolysis biomarkers and/or pump powers.

Although there has been a growing body of studies on short-term ridership prediction approaches, limited effort is made to investigate the short-term subway ridership prediction considering bus transfer activities and temporal features. To fill this gap, a relatively recent data mining approach called gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) is applied to short-term subway ridership prediction and used to capture the associations with the independent variables. Taking three subway stations in Beijing as the cases, the short-term subway ridership and alighting passengers from its adjacent bus stops are obtained based on transit smart card data. To optimize the model performance with different combinations of regularization parameters, a series of GBDT models are built with various learning rates and tree complexities by fitting a maximum of trees. The optimal model performance confirms that the gradient boosting approach can incorporate different types of predictors, fit complex nonlinear relationships, and automatically handle the multicollinearity effect with high accuracy. In contrast to other machine learning methods\u2014or \u201cblack-box\u201d procedures\u2014the GBDT model can identify and rank the relative influences of bus transfer activities and temporal features on short-term subway ridership.

The App automatically labels classroom activities into Stallings-type class observation categories like lecture, classwork, classroom management, practice, question/answer, and reading aloud. Based on the teacher's use of different teaching activities and student performance, the app can provide teachers with intelligent recommendations on how to best allocate class time to various activities. The App used machine learning techniques and was trained on classroom observation data collected from semi-rural primary schools in Pakistan. A variety of machine learning algorithms were evaluated, and using 10-fold cross-validation, the Random Forest algorithm yielded the best accuracy of about 69%.

Modeling Stevens' hypothesized pathological synaptic changes in this framework results in adverse side effects similar to hallucinations and delusions seen in schizophrenia: spontaneous, stimulus-independent retrieval of stored memories focused on just a few of the stored patterns. These could account for the delusions and hallucinations that occur in schizophrenia without any apparent external trigger and for their tendency to concentrate on a few central cognitive and perceptual themes. The model explains why the positive symptoms of schizophrenia tend to wane as the disease progresses, why delayed therapeutic intervention leads to a much slower response, and why delusions and hallucinations may persist for a long time when they do occur.

Instead of generating future frames, we aim at completing visual representations of unfinished video, which can be directly utilized to predict action label no matter at any progress levels.

The new layer of the SVM trains on the new sample, and it extracts and learns the deep features of the signal layer by layer; eventually, after multiple feature mapping, it outputs the diagnostic results on the last layer. Because of the deep structure, the algorithm complexity and operation time increase. Therefore, in this paper, the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) is combined with the sparse theory. By constructing the approximate maximal linearly independent vector set in the feature space, we conduct the sparse expression of samples and obtain the discriminant function for classification, which effectively solves the problem of sparsity deficiency for the LSSVM. Last, the method is used to diagnose centrifugal pump faults and rolling bearing faults and compares with the several methods of the SVM, the SLSSVM, deep SVM, and convolutional neural networks.

The keywords are used to build a training set that is processed by an Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) algorithm that learns what is \u201crelevant\u201d to the user. The rules generated with ILP are used to expand user queries and to rank the results. POIROT also models the behavior of the more important Internet search engines to determine which one to use depending on the topic to search. One important design consideration of POIROT is to build its models without asking the user for feedback, from this perspective POIROT is an active learner. Some comparisons with Metacrawler are reported, showing that POIROT outperforms in terms of relevance and precision of the results presented. Identifying users interests The approach followed by most of the web agents that try to model users is to present an initial questionnaire and ask for feedback from the user after each action or decision (Chen and Sycara 1997, Newell 1997). This approach tend to be molest and extremely poor to gather hidden relations between features or progressive shifts in user interests. One of our main motivations was to identify user interests, and model the users and search engines, without issuing questionnaires or asking the user for feedback. The monitoring of users actions seems to be a promising approach, but there are several issues that difficult its implementation. First, the capture of events in a web browser, as save, print or mouse actions, is not an easy task; and second, its difficult to assign the correct meaning to users actions during web browsing. For instance, its not clear how important is to follow a link or to \u201cview\u201d a page for a given time period. A page may stay in the browser\u2019s window unattended while the users are taking a break, and that doesn\u2019t mean that the page is of interest for the user. The frequency and numbers of visits to a page is a factor that indicates the interest in that page and, more important, interest on the topics related with that particular page (Tauscher and Greenberg 1999). One option to capture the features mentioned was to develop a web browser or a plug-in that monitor the user activity and reports it to a feature extraction module. The problem is that the plug-in \u201clives\u201d during the execution of the web and it is limited to act in a single window at a time, limiting its monitoring possibilities. To develop a web browser, given the installed base of the most popular browsers (Sullivan 199b), doesn\u2019t make sense. Another option considered was to use the cache files stored in the proxy server or local hard disks. The cache maintains a log of visited pages and stores the components that form the pages. But pages in the cache are not necessarily pages of interest, they just reflect the navigation pattern of the user. Popular web browsers give the user the possibility to bookmark pages for future reference. Some web browsers give also the option to organize the bookmarks by topic. Given that the bookmark is an user action that reflects the interest in a given page, we can assert that, at a given time, the pages bookmarked were relevant for the user in terms of general utility, quality, personal interest, frequency of use and potential of future use (Abrams and Baecker 1999). According to (Abrams 1997), 84% of the users use bookmarks, hotlists or favorites lists as a reference to pages that they liked. The bookmarks are tools of natural use for the user that face common problems of Internet as information overload, disorder, redundancy, lack of quality (Tauscher and Greenberg 1999, Lawrence and Giles 1998 and 1999, Baeza 1998). The bookmarks help to reduce the entropy inherent to Internet. Modeling users and search engines Given the decision to use bookmarks as the primary source of information about user interests, the next decision was to develop an agent to extract the information, build a model and interact with the user. From: AAAI Technical Report WS-00-01. Compilation copyright \u00a9 2000, AAAI (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. The first problem in the design of the agent was to identify the features that determine that a given page is of interest for the user. The interest of a user, as we mentioned above, can be determined by several factors, but all of them are associated with the topics covered by the page, so we need to determine what are the topics covered by a given page in order to determine if that page is relevant for the user and its degree of relevance. The topics of a document are not necessarily written explicitly, for instance, a page of a college may mention words as \u201cuniversity\u201d, \u201cfaculty\u201d, \u201cschedules\u201d but the term \u201ceducation\u201d may not appear. Moreover, if that term appears, how to determine that is related to the topics of the page?. Clearly, the topics covered by a web page are determined from the words that are written in the page, the problem is to rank the words in the page according to the relation with the topic of the page. One alternative is to infer the topics covered by a document given the frequency of appearance of certain words in the document and a relation established between those words and the topics. In other words, the words that are more related with the topic of a document should be more frequent than others, and pages that cover same topics should share the same set of frequently used words. (Joachims 1998) suggests to use a feature vector consisting in a word counting vector. Each word has an associated importance, computed based on the frequency of appearance, that serve as input to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Haykin 1999, Burges 1998, Osuna et al. 1997, Nilsson 1999, Pontil and Verri 1997) that determines the proper classification of the document. The problem with this approach, in addition to the computational cost of SVM, is the lack of important features as incremental learning that would give the agent the ability to adapt to user changes. (Salton and McGill 1983) present a method to compute a weighted word counting, using weights determined by an algorithm called TF-IDF (Term Frequency \u2013 Inverse Document Frequency) that became a standard in information retrieval. The general idea is to represent each document as a vector in a feature space, where documents with similar topics should be \u201ccloser\u201d in the space that unrelated ones, given a distance metric. Each dimension of the feature space represents a word and its weight. The weights are computed based on the frequency of the word, TF(p,d), and frequency of documents, DF(p). From DF the inverse, IDF(p), is computed as shown in (1). ) ( log ) ( w DF D w IDF = (1) where |D| is the total number of evaluated documents. The weight of a given word in a document is computed using equation (2). The higher the value of d(i), higher is the significance of the word within the document.. Note that the significance of a word within a document decreases if DF increases, given that if a word is very frequent in a set of documents, that word won\u2019t help us to \u201cseparate\u201d the documents in the feature space. d(i) = TF (pi, d) IDF(wi) (2) As an adaptation of TF-IDF to our particular problem, we assign additional weights to the words according to their position in the HTML document, higher for words appearing in the \u201ckeyword tag\u201d, titles, headers, etc. and lower for normal text. Once the words in each document are ranked, we need to infer rules that, starting from these initial documents (the pages bookmarked by the user), help us to determine the relevance of new pages. This problem can be addressed as inductive concept learning, where the concept to learn (right-hand side of the rules) is \u201crelevance\u201d and the conditions (left-hand side) are logic expressions based on topics found in documents. The pages bookmarked by the users are used as the training set, they are all positive instances of the concept. Inductive Logic Programming (Bergadano and Gunetti 1995) was selected, instead of other inductive methods as Neural Networks, to infer rules due to its ability to derive rules of variable number of conditions, resulting in specific rules (many conditions) that give us precision and general rules (few conditions) that help us to maintain coverage in the search. We limit the number of topics to appear in the left-hand side of rules to 10, to avoid the over-fitting of the agent. The topics with higher ranking are used to build rules of the form: If (topic1, topic2, ... topicn) then Relevant with RF Where RF is the relevant factor computed from the ranking of the topics included in the rule. Once the initial rules are generated, ILP techniques are applied to that rules to generate aggregated rules that are also incorporated to the rule base. The result is a rule base with rules extracted directly from documents and more general rules that apply to the entire set. This maintains the required balance between precision and coverage that is shown in the results. The last issue to address is the modeling of the repositories, search engines in our case; allowing the agent to select the search engine with higher probability to give good results for a particular topic. We use a strategy similar to TF-IDF, maintaining a vector for each", "year": 2000, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "In Proceedings of the AAAI-2000 Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Web Search", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "83942105", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["37899703", "3079421", "10577148", "197541"], "inbound_citations": ["55887333"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:10817982"}

However, Support Vector Machines can suffer a lot from unclean data containing, for example, outliers or mislabeled observations. Although several outlier detection schemes have been proposed in the literature, the selection of outliers versus nonoutliers is often rather ad hoc and does not provide much insight in the data. In robust multivariate statistics outlier maps are quite popular tools to assess the quality of data under consideration. They provide a visual representation of the data depicting several types of outliers. This paper proposes an outlier map designed for Support Vector Machine classification. The Stahel--Donoho outlyingness measure from multivariate statistics is extended to an arbitrary kernel space. A trimmed version of Support Vector Machines is defined trimming part of the samples with largest outlyingness.

A generative adversarial network (GAN) is an algorithm with the capability of generating realistic samples that are similar to the real samples, and it can be applied to solve fault diagnosis problems with insufficient training data, which is called the small sample size condition in this study. However, a single-GAN model cannot achieve a good diagnostic result. To achieve adaptive feature extraction and high diagnosis accuracy, this study proposes an intelligent fault diagnosis method for rotating machinery based on GANs under small sample size conditions. The effectiveness and performance of the proposed method are validated using rolling bearing and gearbox datasets. In these datasets, only 10% and 20% of the samples are selected as the training data. Samples associated with different health conditions and various working conditions are included in the datasets.

{"paper_id": "60966074", "title": "Enhancing classification performance over noise and imbalanced data problems", "authors": [{"first": "Piyasak", "middle": [], "last": "Jeatrakul", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "This research presents the development of techniques to handle two issues in data classification: noise and imbalanced data problems. Noise is a significant problem that can degrade the quality of training data in any learning algorithm. Learning algorithms trained by noisy instances generally increase misclassification when they perform classification. As a result, the classification performance tends to decrease. Meanwhile, the imbalanced data problem is another problem affecting the performance of learning algorithms. If some classes have a much larger number of instances than the others, the learning algorithms tend to be dominated by the features of the majority classes, and the features of the minority classes are difficult to recognise. As a result, the classification performance of the minority classes could be significantly lower than that of the majority classes. It is therefore important to implement techniques to better handle the negative effects of noise and imbalanced data problems. ::: ::: Although there are several approaches attempting to handle noise and imbalanced data problems, shortcomings of the available approaches still exist. For the noise handling techniques, even though the noise tolerant approach does not require any data preprocessing, it can tolerate only a certain amount of noise. The classifier developed from noisy data tends to be less predictive if the training data contains a great number of noise instances. Furthermore, for the noise elimination approach, although it can be easily applied to various problem domains, it could degrade the quality of training data if it cannot distinguish between noise and rare cases (exceptions). Besides, for the imbalanced data problem, the available techniques used still present some limitations. For example, the algorithm-level approach can perform effectively only on specific problem domains or specific learning algorithms. The data-level approach can either eliminate necessary information from the training set or produce the over-fitting problem over the minority class. Moreover, when the imbalanced data problem becomes more complex, such as for the case of multi-class classification, it is difficult to apply the re-sampling techniques (the data-level approach), which perform effectively for imbalanced data problems in binary classification, to the multi-class classification. Due to the limitations above, these lead to the motivation of this research to propose and investigate techniques to handle noise and imbalanced data problems more effectively. ::: ::: This thesis has developed three new techniques to overcome the identified problems. Firstly, a cleaning technique called the Complementary Neural Network (CMTNN) data cleaning technique has been developed in order to remove noise (misclassification data) from the training set. The results show that the new noise detection and removal technique can eliminate noise with confidence. Furthermore, the CMTNN cleaning technique can increase the classification accuracy across different learning algorithms, which are Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k- Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), and Decision Tree (DT). It can provide higher classification performance than other cleaning methods such as Tomek links, the majority voting filtering, and the consensus voting filtering. ::: ::: Secondly, the CMTNN re-sampling technique, which is a new under-sampling technique, has been developed to handle the imbalanced data problem in binary classification. The results show that the combined techniques of the CMTNN resampling technique and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) can perform effectively by improving the classification performance of the minority class instances in terms of Geometric Mean (G-Mean) and the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. It generally provides higher performance than other re-sampling techniques such as Tomek links, Wilson\u2019s Edited Nearest Neighbor Rule (ENN), SMOTE, the combined technique of SMOTE and ENN, and the combined technique of SMOTE and Tomek links. ::: ::: For the third proposed technique, an algorithm named One-Against-All with Data Balancing (OAA-DB) has been developed in order to deal with the imbalanced data problem in multi-class classification. It can be asserted that this algorithm not only improves the performance for the minority class but it also maintains the overall accuracy, which is normally reduced by other techniques. The OAA-DB algorithm can increase the performance in terms of the classification accuracy and F-measure when compared to other multi-class classification approaches including One-Against-All (OAA), One-Against-One (OAO), All and One (A&O), and One Against Higher Order (OAHO) approaches. Furthermore, this algorithm has shown that the re-sampling technique is not only used effectively for the class imbalance problem in binary classification but it has been also applied successfully to the imbalanced data problem in multi-class classification.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1570070578", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["18752099", "17571512"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:60966074"}

IDC is characterized by stunted growth and yellowing and interveinal chlorosis of early trifoliate leaves. Scoring IDC severity in the field is conventionally done by visual assessment. The goal of this study was to investigate the usefulness of RGB (Red Green Blue) images of soybean plots captured under the field condition for IDC scoring. Sixty-four soybean lines with four replicates were planted in six fields over two years. Visual scoring (referred to as Field Score, or FS) was conducted at V3 \u2013 V4 growth stage; and concurrently RGB images of the field plots were recorded with a high-throughput field phenotyping platform. A second set of IDC scores was done on the plot images (displayed on a computer screen) consistently by one person in the office (referred to as Office Score, or OS). Plot images were then processed to remove weeds and extract six color features, which were used to train computer-based IDC scoring models (referred to as Computer Score, or CS) using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results showed that, in the fields where severe IDC symptoms were present, FS and OS were strongly positively correlated with each other, and both of them were strongly negatively correlated with yield. CS could satisfactorily predict IDC scores when evaluated using FS and OS as the reference (overall classification accuracy > 81%). SVM models appeared to outperform LDA models; and the SVM model trained to predict IDC OS gave the highest prediction accuracy. It was anticipated that coupling RGB imaging from the high-throughput field phenotyping platform with real-time image processing and IDC CS models would lead to a more rapid, cost-effective, and objective scoring pipeline for soybean IDC field screening and breeding.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6050400", "pubmed_id": "30050552", "doi": "10.3389/fpls.2018.01002", "venue": "Front.

However, due to the nonstationarity of traffic flow data, traditional point forecasting can hardly be accurate, so probabilistic forecasting methods are essential for quantification of the potential risks and uncertainties for traffic management. A probabilistic forecasting model of traffic flow based on a multikernel extreme learning machine (MKELM) is proposed. Moreover, the optimal output weights of MKELM are obtained by utilizing Quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm. To verify its effectiveness, traffic flow probabilistic prediction using QPSO-MKELM was compared with other learning methods.

It became obvious that they have to interact with humans and should adapt to individual user needs. Especially the high variety of tasks robot assistants will be facing requires a highly adaptive and user-friendly programming interface. One possible solution to this programming problem is the learning-by-demonstration paradigm, where the robot is supposed to observe the execution of a task, acquire task knowledge, and reproduce it. In this paper, a system to record, interpret, and reason over demonstrations of household tasks is presented. The focus is on the model-based representation of manipulation tasks, which serves as a basis for incremental reasoning over the acquired task knowledge. The aim of the reasoning is to condense and interconnect the data, resulting in more general task knowledge. A measure for the assessment of information content of task features is introduced. This measure for the relevance of certain features relies both on general background knowledge as well as task-specific knowledge gathered from the user demonstrations. Beside the autonomous information estimation of features, speech comments during the execution, pointing out the relevance of features are considered as well. The results of the incremental growth of the task knowledge when more task demonstrations become available and their fusion with relevance information gained from speech comments is demonstrated within the task of laying a table", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "17416160", "doi": "10.1109/TSMCB.2006.886951", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2116111609", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["15821378", "14520952", "60905666", "11087908", "15009135", "17873866", "12363830", "10962309", "14665418", "76564", "144767212", "16407191", "17780268", "116700655", "59844192", "59942216", "5768504", "33666824"], "inbound_citations": ["3737936", "43736453", "132203094", "13818577", "14341380", "17485423", "58774437", "18355789", "53709303", "16703135", "53953208", "11271999", "9927320", "203628943", "6752991", "160030141", "15794741", "202679163", "1706742", "8157910", "18466822", "191163514", "208508260", "30608447", "209383037", "885814", "57753530", "209438885", "37144157", "14066081", "12010272", "33748674", "2592317", "55469714", "15626916", "15307923", "15307923", "15307923", "24953090", "24975287", "18197722", "18110168", "17402617", "5268324", "34537", "26642249", "3133713", "19297014", "53586467", "14155142", "1710016", "14252350", "3239604", "1756230", "16836673", "4594674", "31174075", "20611529", "15656000", "2705346", "7026506", "6215120", "16927686", "15319323", "17034241", "14315446", "34543305", "8005307", "77387230", "52930349", "8174335", "211570474", "17529199", "8803451", "6094035", "68155997", "13143419", "2553026", "54033772", "210877353", "57753717", "208958394", "10332244", "21925199", "2266997", "8919195", "25847138", "210693086", "15273285", "201812760", "3784939", "16637432", "11798033", "19013657", "204811897", "62630038", "486019", "205006734"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:23095553"}

Several approaches, such as the memory and multiple population schemes, have been developed for EAs to address dynamic problems. This paper investigates the application of the memory scheme for population-based incremental learning (PBIL) algorithms, a class of EAs, for DOPs. A PBIL-specific associative memory scheme, which stores best solutions as well as corresponding environmental information in the memory, is investigated to improve its adaptability in dynamic environments. In this paper, the interactions between the memory scheme and random immigrants, multipopulation, and restart schemes for PBILs in dynamic environments are investigated. In order to better test the performance of memory schemes for PBILs and other EAs in dynamic environments, this paper also proposes a dynamic environment generator that can systematically generate dynamic environments of different difficulty with respect to memory schemes. Using this generator, a series of dynamic environments are generated and experiments are carried out to compare the performance of investigated algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed memory scheme is efficient for PBILs in dynamic environments and also indicate that different interactions exist between the memory scheme and random immigrants, multipopulation schemes for PBILs in different dynamic environments.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TEVC.2007.913070", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2147585405", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["122262027", "14799233", "2970147", "657686", "14149041", "6156741", "6601823", "13282951", "5675394", "14909014", "14121706", "10772949", "60765706", "15614565", "82187496", "117776882", "16394966", "107694320", "17383154", "61142155", "2491427", "9509936", "10036385", "59795528", "81635827", "107939389", "6206456", "60685008", "57664825", "30694871", "5847492", "6902860", "17878268", "10429548", "79991", "194580", "16567113", "5593678", "9330528"], "inbound_citations": ["32800889", "198133620", "30395944", "16577416", "7511875", "11818082", "14870651", "115371373", "21493518", "13945784", "14517123", "17340900", "8483725", "6850611", "8903065", "11411809", "12226157", "70216139", "6834103", "16567113", "58307", "34154470", "16647545", "2068465", "7546290", "2596981", "28733049", "15427855", "212414360", "14611693", "14818288", "14504325", "57191293", "8329991", "10581647", "15730052", "16835507", "6144741", "10521829", "8244491", "14533669", "14796297", "17006589", "39022993", "14854092", "12381218", "11510470", "2754582", "201756287", "6243808", "11866588", "215228480", "3307691", "18182472", "21409159", "59328610", "16393080", "2015382", "9463326", "8761885", "5100266", "33410109", "12607240", "8026574", "10254809", "16372828", "9252709", "13835388", "59555559", "1947041", "16010003", "37710071", "1468650", "763076", "9797968", "1430244", "24185519", "24185519", "1718369", "16697908", "15040099", "16320885", "12201618", "5199484", "11589958", "15287890", "14422881", "16051643", "597270", "11422966", "16335119", "958874", "15958598", "49191576", "116470499", "6067880", "17485313", "15054509", "18284410", "1036578", "34048048", "18061027", "15053535", "7655795", "6939734", "9789095", "42139229", "205455722", "9204966", "3445199", "14383567", "18316109", "32182962", "15672430", "15566815", "7546998", "16732688", "18086162", "56169149", "12440823", "5839181", "209853308", "125978324", "5033849", "3965307", "23205651", "47009286", "3737724", "61141530", "9921406", "58014387", "11805497", "34731730", "15108020", "7122226", "817748", "15126044", "16529354", "1572264", "54015906", "7994732", "194580", "16621024", "7814935", "18651846", "7592922", "59235871", "12327793", "5139705", "16513620", "17898047", "16369364"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1381570"}

While single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are frequently employed in these studies, the cost of genotyping a huge number of SNPs remains a limiting factor, particularly in low and middle income countries. Therefore, it is important to detect a subset of SNPs to represent the rest of SNPs with maximum possible accuracy. The present study introduces a new method, CLONTagger with parameter optimization, which uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict the rest of SNPs and Clonal Selection Algorithm (CLONALG) to select tag SNPs. Furthermore, the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is preferred for the optimization of C and \u03b3 parameters of the Support Vector Machine.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is such an algorithm and it is an attractive choice for online Support Vector Machine (SVM) training due to its simplicity and effectiveness. When equipped with kernel functions, similarly to other SVM learning algorithms, SGD is susceptible to the curse of kernelization that causes unbounded linear growth in model size and update time with data size. This may render SGD inapplicable to large data sets. We address this issue by presenting a class of Budgeted SGD (BSGD) algorithms for large-scale kernel SVM training which have constant space and constant time complexity per update. Specifically, BSGD keeps the number of support vectors bounded during training through several budget maintenance strategies. We treat the budget maintenance as a source of the gradient error, and show that the gap between the BSGD and the optimal SVM solutions depends on the model degradation due to budget maintenance. To minimize the gap, we study greedy budget maintenance methods based on removal, projection, and merging of support vectors. We propose budgeted versions of several popular online SVM algorithms that belong to the SGD family. We further derive BSGD algorithms for multi-class SVM training. Comprehensive empirical results show that BSGD achieves higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art budgeted online algorithms and comparable to non-budget algorithms, while achieving impressive computational efficiency both in time and space during training and prediction.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "J.

While, how to transfer a deep network trained by historical failure data for prediction of a new object is rarely researched. In this paper, a deep transfer learning (DTL) network based on sparse autoencoder (SAE) is presented. In the DTL method, three transfer strategies, that is, weight transfer, transfer learning of hidden feature, and weight update, are used to transfer an SAE trained by historical failure data to a new object. By these strategies, prediction of the new object without supervised information for training is achieved. Moreover, the learned features by deep transfer network for the new object share joint and similar characteristic to that of historical failure data, which is beneficial to accurate prediction. Case study on remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of cutting tool is performed to validate effectiveness of the DTL method. An SAE network is first trained by run-to-failure data with RUL information of a cutting tool in an off-line process. The trained network is then transferred to a new tool under operation for on-line RUL prediction. The prediction result with high accuracy shows advantage of the DTL method for RUL prediction.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TII.2018.2881543", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2900529838", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["12970243", "113006941", "125414895", "114681604", "124498557", "122919128", "1084347", "21293705", "111140188", "32692640", "125706169", "7853630", "111513521", "5673774", "85443008", "125974628", "3325688", "113475334", "25401510", "19493068", "31298428", "16154632", "13313961", "120705202", "39422332", "112531639", "117248575", "49576945", "110988692", "3818866", "13102422", "3706921", "24829449", "11098693", "31594113", "43868572", "54452566", "70163837", "115508532", "64610388", "196158199", "69579811", "1916221", "114168732", "113773376", "116467887", "8292451", "393948", "56594323", "10977504", "121264768"], "inbound_citations": ["201813706", "202729441", "208037744", "209515640", "86838054", "81982165", "149808992", "204090578", "86717787", "209489386", "208158300", "182702866", "203655917", "209376485"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:69226118"}

There are multiple corpora created for the task during the years of research. Unfortunately, these corpora often have incompatible annotation guidelines and tag sets. This makes it difficult to utilize more than one corpus for training machine learning methods. Several attempts to manually unify guidelines and tag sets took place in the past. The most recent one was MorphoRuEval-2017 evaluation where organizers decided to unify annotations of four corpora. In this paper we propose a morphological tagging method which is able to be trained on any set of corpora with arbitrary guidelines and tag sets without any manual mapping provided. The method is based on transfer learning technique successfully applied in multilingual and cross-domain research. Firstly we establish a couple of solid neural network-based morphological tagging baselines. They both employ bidirectional LSTM networks but utilize different word embeddings. Comparative study on multiple corpora shows that fasttext model clearly outperforms word2vec one. Further we extend these baselines with transfer learning application. We prove transfer learning-based method effectiveness by performing two series of experiments. In the first series we exploit three wellknown corpora with incompatible tag sets: RNC, SynTagRus (original and Universal Dependencies versions). In the second series we utilize four corpora from MorphoRuEval-2017 evaluation with tag sets preliminary unified by organizers. In both cases transfer learning application improves performance of the method while training on more corpora.

While automatic localization of the spinal cord might appear as a simple task, that has already been addressed extensively, it is much more challenging to achieve this across the large variation in MRI contrasts, field of view, resolutions and pathologies. In this study, we introduce a novel method, called \u201cOptiC\u201d, to automatically and robustly localize the spinal cord on a large variety of MRI data. Starting from a localization map computed by a linear Support Vector Machine trained with Histogram of Oriented Gradient features, the center of the spinal cord is localized by solving an optimization problem, that introduces a trade-off between the localization map and the cord continuity along the superior-inferior axis. The OptiC algorithm features an efficient search (with a linear complexity in the number of voxels) and ensures the global minimum is reached. OptiC was compared to a recently-published method based on the Hough transform using a broad range of MRI data, involving 13 different centers, 3 contrasts (\\(T_2\\)-weighted n=278, \\(T_1\\)-weighted n=112 and \\(T_2^*\\)-weighted n=263), with a total of 441 subjects, including 133 patients with traumatic and neurodegenerative diseases. Overall, OptiC was able to find 98.5% of the gold-standard centerline coverage, with a mean square error of 1.21 mm, suggesting that OptiC could reliably be used for subsequent analyses tasks, such as cord segmentation, opening the door to more robust analysis in patient population.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-66185-8_80", "venue": "MICCAI", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2752467897", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["127790986", "31287731"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9557597"}

Fourteen brain regions of interest were selected according to previous studies. An ensemble learning modeling framework was used to integrate imaging data and genetic data. ::: ::: ::: STATISTICAL TESTS ::: Support vector machine (SVM) with linear kernel was utilized to integrate multimode information and then to construct the prediction model. Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was used to evaluate the performance. The position characteristics obtained through SVM-RFE (recursive feature elimination) algorithm and LOOCV was considered to compare each feature's relative importance for the prediction model. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Compared with the single-level prediction model, the ensemble learning prediction model showed improvement in prediction performance (accuracy from 0.61 to 0.86 with imaging data and genetic data). Integrated with 14 priori brain regions, the region of interest (ROI) map ensemble learning prediction model can achieve a performance that is analogous with the model with information from whole-brain regions (both with accuracy of 0.81). The integration of genetic features further improved the sensitivity of prediction (sensitivity from 0.78 to 0.87 under the ensemble learning framework). ::: ::: ::: DATA CONCLUSION ::: Our ensemble learning prediction model demonstrated significant advantages in interpretability and information integration.

To strengthen the forecasting ability of the original support vector machines (SVMs) model, the self-organizing map (SOM) is adopted to group inputs into different clusters in advance of the proposed SOM-SVM model. Two different input methods are proposed for the SVM-based forecasting method, namely, SOM-SVM1 and SOM-SVM2. The methods are applied to an actual reservoir watershed to determine the 1 to 3 h ahead inflow forecasts. For 1, 2, and 3 h ahead forecasts, improvements in mean coefficient of efficiency (MCE) due to the clusters obtained from SOM-SVM1 are 21.5%, 18.5%, and 23.0%, respectively. Furthermore, improvement in MCE for SOM-SVM2 is 20.9%, 21.2%, and 35.4%, respectively. Another SOM-SVM2 model increases the SOM-SVM1 model for 1, 2, and 3 h ahead forecasts obtained improvement increases of 0.33%, 2.25%, and 10.08%, respectively. These results show that the performance of the proposed model can provide improved forecasts of hourly inflow, especially in the proposed SOM-SVM2 model. In conclusion, the proposed model, which considers limit and higher related inputs instead of all inputs, can generate better forecasts in different clusters than are generated from the SOM process.

Determining the optimal parameters must be considered to obtain a high classification accuracy on LSSVM. This paper proposed an optimization method based on Improved Ant Colony Algorithm (IACA) in determining the optimal parameters of LSSVM for diagnosing Hepatitis disease. IACA create a storage solution to keep the whole route of the ants. The solutions that have been stored were the value of the parameter LSSVM. There are three main stages in this study.

We propose a novel deep 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) conditioned Face Frontalization Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), termed as FF-GAN, to generate neutral head pose face images. Our framework differs from both traditional GANs and 3DMM based modeling. Incorporating 3DMM into the GAN structure provides shape and appearance priors for fast convergence with less training data, while also supporting end-to-end training. The 3DMM-conditioned GAN employs not only the discriminator and generator loss but also a new masked symmetry loss to retain visual quality under occlusions, besides an identity loss to recover high frequency information.

First, local features are used as the vertices of the two-graph model and the relationships among local features in the intra-frames and inter-frames are characterized by the edges. Then, the proposed CGKs are applied to measure the similarity between actions represented by the two-graph model. Graphs can be decomposed into numbers of primary walk groups with different walk lengths and our CGKs are based on the context-dependent primary walk group matching. Taking advantage of the context information makes the correctly matched primary walk groups dominate in the CGKs and improves the performance of similarity measurement between graphs. Finally, a generalized multiple kernel learning algorithm with a proposed l12-norm regularization is applied to combine these CGKs optimally together and simultaneously train a set of action classifiers.

There are two key issues with this method per se that severely restrict its applicability, which we solve in this paper: first, how to handle class overlap, and second, how to provide (nonlinear) solutions with better generalization ability. The first problem is handled via using so-called kernel functions and slack variables. The second problem is dealt with using a penalization term that suppresses too complex solutions. We call the resulting method the soft-NCH classifier. In spirit and computationally the method is close to the popular Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and can be viewed as an instance-based large-margin classification technique.

Mainly, there have been new breakthroughs in the modeling of signals as the output of switched dynamical systems where the switching indicates underlying events of interest. This method is known as hybrid system identification. These problems can be formulated as polynomial optimization problems by which, through algebraic reformulations, convex optimization approaches now exist. In this work, we explore the application of these new approaches, which lay at the intersection of systems and control with machine learning, for the detection of events in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Our particular focus on EEG signals is twofold. First, these signals are routinely used to monitor the quality of sleep, which is critical to both physical and mental health. Second, the onset of the internet-of-things has driven industry to develop affordable, in home, EEG sleep monitors. 2 Most of these devices will take advantage of cloud services where vast amounts of sleep data will be processed. There have been various attempts to develop automatic staging systems using mostly machine learning approaches such as Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks. However, there is very limited research that explores the use of switched dynamical systems to model sleep waveforms. This thesis work is the first step towards this direction. It focuses on modeling spindles, found in stage two of sleep, as switched Autoregressive (AR) models where the switching events are used to determine if a spindle occurred.

For all sorts of reasons, standard generative phonological theories cannot be implemented in connectionist frameworks. Lakoff's theory of cognitive phonology offers solutions to some of these problems in that it offers an alternative way to think about derivations and ordered rules, as well as eliminating the need for right-to-left iterative rule application. We will begin by describing our 'many maps' model and show how Lakoff's cross-level phonological constructions may be implemented. As will become clear, our basic assumption is that all phonological constructions should express correlations between levels and be satisfied in parallel, simultaneously, across the entire input domain. After describing the general properties of our model and how mappings between levels are actually implemented, we will consider a number of specific cases. In particular, we will focus on the those apparently involving iterative application of rules: Slovak shortening, Gidabal shortening, and vowel harmony in Yawelmani. Our challenge is obviously to provide alternative accounts of those cases involving intra-level rules in Lakoff's theory. We believe that the clustering mechanism allows us to do this. Finally, the complex rule interactions in Icelandic will be addressed, and we will show that our theory, though very tightly constrained, can handle this case as well.

Two issues exist in the system: first, the current output of the CTC model relies on the current input and does not account for context weighted inputs. This is the hard alignment issue. Second, the word-based CTC model suffers from the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issue. This means it can model only frequently occurring words while tagging the remaining words as OOV. Hence, such a model is limited in its capacity in recognizing only a fixed set of frequent words. In this study, we propose addressing these problems using a combination of attention mechanism and mixed-units. In particular, we introduce Attention CTC, Self-Attention CTC, Hybrid CTC, and Mixed-unit CTC. First, we blend attention modeling capabilities directly into the CTC network using Attention CTC and Self-Attention CTC. Second, to alleviate the OOV issue, we present Hybrid CTC which uses a word and letter CTC with shared hidden layers. The Hybrid CTC consults the letter CTC when the word CTC emits an OOV. Then, we propose a much better solution by training a Mixed-unit CTC which decomposes all the OOV words into sequences of frequent words and multi-letter units. Evaluated on a 3400 hours Microsoft Cortana voice assistant task, our final acoustic-to-word solution using attention and mixed-units achieves a relative reduction in word error rate (WER) over the vanilla word CTC by 12.09%.

A BEHAVE fuel-type map from 2002, together with field data also obtained in 2002 during the Third Spanish National Forest Inventory, was used as reference data. The BEHAVE fuel types of the reference dataset were first converted into the Fire Behaviour Fuel Types described by Scott and Burgan, taking into account the vegetation of the study area. Then, three pixel-based algorithms (Maximum Likelihood, Neural Network and Support Vector Machine) and an Object-Based Image Analysis were applied to classify the Scott and Burgan fire behaviour fuel types from an ASTER image from 3 March 2003. The performance of the algorithms tested was assessed and compared in terms of quantity disagreement and allocation disagreement. Within the pixel-based classifications, the best results were obtained from the Support Vector Machine algorithm, which showed an overall accuracy of 83%; 14% of disagreement was due to allocation and 3% to quantity disagreement. The Object-Based Image Analysis approach produced the most accurate maps, with an overall accuracy of 95%; 4% disagreement was due to allocation and 1% to quantity disagreement. The object-based classification achieved thus an overall accuracy of 12% above the best results obtained for the pixel-based algorithms tested.

INTRODUCTION Generally, data mining (sometimes called data or knowledge discovery) is the process of analyzing data from different perspectives and summarizing it into useful information - information that can be used to increase revenue, cuts costs, or both. Data mining algorithms which carry out the assigning of objects into related classes are called classifiers. Classification algorithms include two main phases; in the first phase they try to find a model for the class attribute as a function of other variables of the datasets, and in the second phase, they apply previously designed model on the new and unseen datasets for determining the related class of each record (1)(3). There are different methods for data classification such as Decision Trees (DT), Rule Based Methods, Logistic Regression (LogR), Linear Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Linear Classifier (LC) and so forth. The comparison of the classifiers and using the most predictive classifier is very important. Each of the classification methods shows different efficacy and accuracy based on the kind of dataset (2) . In addition, there are various evaluation metrics for comparing the classification methods that each of them could be useful depending on the kind of the problem. Among the other criteria for comparing the classification methods, one could mention; precision, recall, error rate, confusion matrix. In this article, using a new method, five usual data classification methods (Decision tree, Multi- layer perception, Naive Bayes, C4.5, SVM) have been compared based on the AUC criterion. These mentioned methods have been applied on the random generated datasets which are", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.21090/ijaerd.0101001", "venue": "International Journal of Advance Engineering and Research Development", "journal": "International Journal of Advance Engineering and Research Development", "mag_id": "2329478815", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["3806442", "44046266", "52014088", "52987075", "46980376", "213183506", "46939860"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62248448"}

In this paper, we offer an in-depth analysis of a random forests model suggested by Breiman (2004), which is very close to the original algorithm. We show in particular that the procedure is consistent and adapts to sparsity, in the sense that its rate of convergence depends only on the number of strong features and not on how many noise variables are present.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": "1005.0208", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "arXiv: Machine Learning", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2214916291,2951480043", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5883609", "62740572", "12470146", "10734193", "15970251", "1290347", "7048603", "10292736", "207738357", "10844956", "123042984", "60993494", "11964764", "11387983", "14772932", "88524200", "116929976", "15245447", "12394453", "33779230", "14864905", "43315484", "206420153", "117961343", "121117171", "2469856", "28528", "119027153", "35730151", "23369575", "16162039"], "inbound_citations": ["17887242", "1429301", "3409435", "3747150", "45232767", "210920571", "210920635", "54640312", "41483535", "48578407", "88518367", "199315770", "195357449", "53224143", "197421652", "5613979", "14518730", "46870929", "7361444", "209376325", "17780684", "14355736", "113047800", "214795649", "215630281", "43009144", "59234251", "155098855", "210861605", "2045313", "3994273", "199442389", "55702155", "3491020", "90263098", "2608875", "52084613", "125280586", "28649655", "124756597", "211056756", "18579383", "126361844", "16769447", "16132482", "33338336", "1168129", "3270609", "2130307", "5808271", "88508312", "8079788", "53017120", "116373159", "23781221", "201629067", "16698397", "55216509", "128316570", "77386421", "51611713", "12690864", "198164771", "131893884", "73728457", "207870481", "148870", "15735208", "55302928", "4589385", "15107573", "51879400", "210921143", "214802594", "211258875", "25423607", "208882337", "17832453", "140253391", "14864270", "85529868", "214743283", "3327791", "52953359", "46855880", "11771430", "5797844", "210023530", "173990689", "2135106", "59453855", "62337444", "4304814", "49432211", "42825955", "88518437", "202538633", "214795261", "10571053", "8103668", "43998193", "201146808", "57427535", "51868185", "125822373", "5061240", "195698536", "199384961", "53105082", "49867924", "209321691", "51738405", "3483355", "49653650", "58465412", "25688406", "84186550", "64089567", "207556042", "73722505", "174818328", "13659199", "195831496", "51758182", "54832431", "13778003", "52125743", "54009435", "29062854", "17391225", "20849056", "14792844", "13714760", "53665727", "30965315", "53120824", "201034970", "88518688", "195584509", "746921", "16813701", "207869921", "211119506", "174804662", "134673785", "53085381", "6768407", "28681368", "3821055", "52935666", "1606209", "58004614", "53743132", "205121558", "26040810", "22324277", "13797664", "3790207", "12207977", "2017394", "16121735", "12512566", "54073608", "28878289", "1169536", "8503522", "3618762", "14493742", "208006788", "16228044", "7014694", "4861968", "202706485", "32933056", "214969197", "478211", "54578672", "52983113", "155980866", "199534542", "53226912", "8869713", "53566111", "51909948", "88521030", "124081337", "210157297", "35064889", "59408209", "3301679", "3821814", "210861095", "214262720", "46912350", "16547182", "8758844", "210164587", "21291257", "56169139", "23814032", "30578093", "46848487", "25094001", "86544966", "113475334", "12080461", "207995363", "10345611", "24122243", "15676251", "54523214", "34472299", "8357129", "199509905", "135430419", "9085107", "211032079", "211243069", "13798071", "195753391", "204947418", "59616493", "41610136", "21629626", "78090440", "214595542", "24344518", "8615969", "3792717", "17070767", "88515051", "3292071", "88519984", "189824290", "215122279", "13672143", "1106487", "11624573", "204246592", "189825090", "53722242", "7416021", "133064798", "14894799", "15769153", "44076034", "53008228", "20391265", "7532499", "208523373", "210157052", "53568828", "1062258", "58014100", "145022387", "31375221", "12035831", "108370039", "150185259", "204782393", "204331183", "4618352", "1719275", "17486445", "14379045", "62836735", "3140222", "58013185", "15992194", "15406082", "12564329", "53035566", "27681943", "10143129", "21248359", "30663415", "199589510", "199550822", "211529123", "4020054", "213691319", "20840281", "4557191", "6585389", "51735142", "6707858", "17226823", "16993969", "12141772", "125504621", "42870303", "195345051", "49303271", "4367014", "3511966", "88520026", "197902219", "27666166", "85512540", "3773614", "211119423", "148571804"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14463568"}

The Population Health Metrics Research Consortium (PHMRC) collected 12 535 VAs in four countries for which the true cause of death was reliably known. This project led to the development of three new computer algorithms to determine cause of death from these VAs, all of which predict underlying cause of death more accurately than the status quo: physician review. Concurrently, ensemble models, or blends of well-performing models, have been shown to have favourable predictive validity and have begun to be implemented in global health metrics settings. Methods We developed a simple ensemble model based on the three top performing PHMRC methods: the Simplified Symptom Pattern (SSP), the Tariff, and the Random Forest (RF). This ensemble method functions at the individual-record level, examining the predicted cause of death from the three component models and selecting cause of death by a simple majority (Popular Voting). Sensitivity analyses revealed that selecting the prediction made by RF in cases where all three models disagreed was preferable, and this ensemble method was adapted accordingly. Findings The Popular Voting method performed better in cause-specific mortality fraction accuracy than did any individual model alone for adults, children, and neonates, and performed better in chance-corrected concordance than did any individual model except SSP in adults. The three component models disagreed in 16% of all cases, and unanimously agreed in 47% of cases. Interpretation As VA continues to be an effective source of data for estimating cause of death, accurate and inexpensive methods for analysing VA interview responses are increasingly important. The recent development of the three highly accurate PHMRC computational models allows for the option of a meta-model such as the ensemble introduced here. This ensemble model for VA achieves superior performance, and could be applied to other VA samples to accurately assess the relative mortality burden from a variety of diseases and injuries.

Solving multicategory problems by a series of binary classifiers is quite common in the SVM paradigm; however, this approach may fail under various circumstances. We propose the multicategory support vector machine (MSVM), which extends the binary SVM to the multicategory case and has good theoretical properties. The proposed method provides a unifying framework when there are either equal or unequal misclassification costs. As a tuning criterion for the MSVM, an approximate leave-one-out cross-validation function, called Generalized Approximate Cross Validation, is derived, analogous to the binary case. The effectiveness of the MSVM is demonstrated through the applications to cancer classification using microarray data and cloud classification with satellite radiance profiles.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1198/016214504000000098", "venue": "German Conference on Bioinformatics", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": null, "outbound_citations": ["194951", "5934464", "60486887", "47109072", "119479891", "16461630", "15562876", "1888591", "118079586", "118097276", "7087225", "5801524", "59754112", "65860", "64543020", "7138354", "118677895", "5738808", "15514452"], "inbound_citations": ["15263365", "315488", "212633459", "2816072", "18568711", "15693663", "7349658", "15058057", "6573260", "13799999", "22244472", "89609080", "8696946", "14291272", "5786552", "59470790", "120949527", "1703112", "9984649", "16053819", "73603", "3078684", "9838468", "9259468", "15321550", "2830693", "12413651", "59528270", "3211591", "49563968", "17042300", "6925481", "16146252", "26318874", "32085726", "38397086", "14566577", "11380119", "15527239", "17278006", "17949517", "7620967", "14524734", "14448010", "90263689", "54841072", "15014295", "15880277", "32401871", "425242", "7360806", "33749713", "2599011", "214641132", "53237370", "207449293", "10539794", "10539794", "8085785", "5102950", "16204111", "24121556", "7549304", "214704924", "3094788", "6725543", "13046983", "215040873", "195492074", "49554196", "117325013", "58616678", "18910216", "88518569", "4519007", "16590290", "7882306", "166227973", "34208807", "21961673", "18945155", "13670246", "12712637", "4469848", "36002012", "3992925", "52267414", "14385166", "3014742", "351824", "26816442", "181858", "32130721", "16479954", "215220970", "14665390", "10913546", "16551561", "5582930", "4843607", "211298579", "117816495", "20481617", "52284066", "14164639", "15405677", "125693205", "14860402", "8840783", "5213983", "15913227", "17811543", "2709783", "10891322", "12175717", "59600470", "6271357", "46970141", "13888789", "334678", "10342131", "10342131", "35795071", "11490927", "52991120", "16920893", "61153487", "2745021", "17650177", "175794", "4517081", "6675635", "9020623", "6334850", "15505139", "8156583", "6915167", "1312964", "16217263", "17272751", "55001086", "17784104", "15182196", "17864235", "60547680", "7087225", "4518383", "15170034", "9215575", "13958795", "16586261", "8769153", "798193", "18823506", "18876084", "674508", "9901535", "210473566", "4502442", "951428", "10962571", "1598654", "62016270", "126320459", "10661683", "4862765", "14881861", "10206899", "2431211", "17754068", "181965", "2895526", "17823469", "12188377", "88511721", "11255071", "17641174", "2601190", "15348054", "17915728", "16300742", "13537400", "6874620", "555572", "213196055", "32220823", "51965477", "88517893", "8358534", "15126576", "18029505", "17542347", "13119526", "10143553", "21395241", "15720274", "33421156", "46848487", "15023188", "27964145", "129926257", "49351498", "274094", "15462651", "10100884", "15133424", "9251990", "69168403", "8505575", "19555983", "12550213", "2636773", "7932246", "16343583", "16343583", "16343583", "1345538", "14901434", "189928005", "69288686", "16686519", "54464031", "10659897", "11355553", "11303424", "15123165", "11315000", "16816587", "14438343", "5475601", "51880680", "16049948", "18210108", "11803458", "14394460", "12246009", "2459246", "12415639", "15612574", "203744461", "14517208", "502964", "9335623", "7905562", "1356120", "15465598", "17474212", "17989071", "18812431", "6475282", "49674297", "12414180", "3749904", "10748987", "211204739", "17770669", "4228580", "73558214", "120169246", "2328675", "109379470", "13781839", "15499105", "13909243", "13836015", "8130721", "4471142", "60873888", "16529418", "7330761", "10891133", "20177200", "17835539", "58561538", "813254", "2142239", "12004811", "17795284", "4471512", "225244", "735828", "44518796", "14780228", "18091411", "18103624", "9407904", "17598843", "7167312", "17291740", "16516820", "14790390", "15977328", "14933068", "17230620", "1723729", "700350", "56177574", "42912583", "129610382", "1912061", "37726606", "15409845", "5372150", "15105759", "2921358", "2921358", "2635218", "145814262", "8134924", "202788310", "11323493", "15015804", "16071589", "15684489", "270661", "18784892", "207973217", "55079172", "44832509", "172132434", "7231768"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7087225"}

GANs have been previously used for resolution enhancement of photography and optical microscopy images. We have adapted and improved this technique for OCT image generation. Conditional GANs (cGANs) were trained on a novel set of ultrahigh resolution spectral domain OCT volumes, termed micro-OCT, as the high-resolution ground truth (~1$\\mu$m isotropic resolution). The ground truth was paired with a low-resolution image obtained by synthetically degrading resolution 4x in one of (1-D) or both axial and lateral axes (2-D). Cross-sectional image (B-scan) volumes obtained from in vivo imaging of human labial (lip) tissue and mouse skin were used in separate feasibility experiments. Accuracy of resolution enhancement compared to ground truth was quantified with human perceptual accuracy tests performed by an OCT expert. The GAN loss in the optimization objective, and noise injection in both the generator and discriminator models were found to be important for achieving realistic speckle appearance in the generated OCT images. Qualitative examples applying the models to image data from outside of the training data distribution, namely human retina and mouse bladder, were also demonstrated, suggesting potential for cross-domain transferability. This preliminary study suggests that deep learning generative models trained on OCT images from high-performance prototype systems may have potential in enhancing lower resolution data from mainstream/commercial systems, thereby bringing cutting-edge technology to the masses at low cost.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2003.06035", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3012216802", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering", "Physics"], "outbound_citations": ["14677741", "9707938", "28905073", "42756398", "123861536", "3074096", "200102472", "195825822", "53749133", "6200260", "56177354", "53715696", "145024258", "278312", "3537907", "157067097", "3719281", "41805341", "5334482", "211022860", "145052179", "56170332", "202155861", "211227", "53095699", "201698397", "586333", "43919703", "46878454"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:212717714"}

However, they expose uncertainty and unreliability against the well-designed inputs, i.e., adversarial examples. Accordingly, various studies have emerged for both attack and defense addressed in different graph analysis tasks, leading to the arms race in graph adversarial learning. For instance, the attacker has poisoning and evasion attack, and the defense group correspondingly has preprocessing- and adversarial- based methods. Despite the booming works, there still lacks a unified problem definition and a comprehensive review. To bridge this gap, we investigate and summarize the existing works on graph adversarial learning tasks systemically. Specifically, we survey and unify the existing works w.r.t. attack and defense in graph analysis tasks, and give proper definitions and taxonomies at the same time. Besides, we emphasize the importance of related evaluation metrics, and investigate and summarize them comprehensively.

Rainfall, temperature and evapotranspiration are major parameters of climate affecting changes in the environment. Evapotranspiration plays a key role in crop production and water balance of a region, one of the major parameters affected by climate change. The reference evapotranspiration or ET 0 is a calculated parameter used in this research. In the present study, changes in the future rainfall, minimum and maximum temperature, and ET 0 have been shown by downscaling the HadCM3 (Hadley Centre Coupled Model version 3) model data. The selected study area is located in a part of the Narmada river basin area in Madhya Pradesh in central India. The downscaled outputs of projected rainfall, ET 0 and temperatures have been shown for the 21st century with the HADCM3 data of A2 scenario by the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) model. The efficiency of the LS-SVM model was measured by different statistical methods. The selected predictors show considerable correlation with the rainfall and temperature and the application of this model has been done in a basin area which is an agriculture based region and is sensitive to the change of rainfall and temperature. Results showed an increase in the future rainfall, temperatures and ET 0 . The temperature increase is projected in the high rise of minimum temperature in winter time and the highest increase in maximum temperature is projected in the pre-monsoon season or from March to May. Highest increase is projected in the 2080s in 2081\u20132091 and 2091\u20132099 in maximum temperature and 2091\u20132099 in minimum temperature in all the stations. Winter maximum temperature has been observed to have increased in the future. High rainfall is also observed with higher ET 0 in some decades. Two peaks of the increase are observed in ET 0 in the April\u2013May and in the October. Variation in these parameters due to climate change might have an impact on the future water resource of the study area, which is mainly an agricultural based region, and will help in proper planning and management.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.gsf.2016.06.002", "venue": null, "journal": "Geoscience frontiers", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2437478246", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science"], "outbound_citations": ["129359316", "9176336", "440680", "129653910", "128947626", "126993876", "128843101", "120615684", "129309167", "131611107", "128895481", "128971935", "109082209", "120960575", "126864232", "141490397", "124135431", "129703015", "121721238", "11225382", "121089642", "129413425", "120707725", "5025673", "121070291", "129505153", "140164618", "128879463", "73569816", "54959841", "83385386", "131110140", "128477484", "16096142", "207579947", "154064885", "131685874", "128619546", "128967317", "129355387", "128582690", "28543049"], "inbound_citations": ["14618176", "134710366", "125730983", "125099624", "59568484", "56246766", "214708878", "214705428", "20605698", "135052082"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:133166723"}

For example, predictions of solubility are used in the agrochemical and pharmaceutical industries to assess the environmental fate of potential pollutants and the bioavailability of de novo designed drugs, respectively. While a number of statistical Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) solubility models have been built by many groups, including ourselves [1], development of a method based on chemical theory and molecular simulation has proved challenging. Successful construction of a fully theoretical method would bring both greater insight and systematic improvability, with physically meaningful component effects becoming quantifiable. Here we show that reasonably accurate values for the intrinsic aqueous solubility of druglike organic molecules are obtainable from theory [2]. We combine sublimation free energies calculated using the crystal lattice minimisation program DMACRYS with hydration free energies calculated using the 3D Reference Interaction Site Model (3DRISM) [3,4,5] of the Integral Equation Theory of Molecular Liquids (IET). Intrinsic solubilities of 25 diverse crystalline druglike molecules are computed by our method, obtaining R=0.85 and RMSE =1.45 log10 S units. This is considerably better than results from implicit continuum solvent models such as the polarizable continuum model (PCM). We can fully computationally describe the thermodynamics of the transfer of a druglike molecule from the crystalline solid phase via the gas phase to dilute aqueous solution. Although the 3D RISM free energy functional that we use contains some parameters, our approach is not parameterized against experimentally measured solubilities. Ongoing work to improve the accuracy of the calculated sublimation thermodynamic parameters will also be discussed. 1. Palmer, D. S.; O'Boyle, N. M.; Glen, R. C.; Mitchell, J. B. O.

PCR-RFLP requires an available restriction enzyme at least for identify a target SNP and an effective primer pair conforms numerous constraints. However, the lots of restriction enzymes, tedious sequence and complicated constraints make the mining of available restriction enzymes and the design of effective primer pairs become a major challenge. In the study, we propose a novel and available CI (Computation Intelligence)-based method called TLBO (teaching-learning-based optimization) and introduce the elite strategy to design effective primer pairs.

Both methods showed excellent genus level identification, but SVM showed slightly better accuracy for most species. Highly accurate species level identification remains a challenge, especially in distinguishing between species from the same genus which may require improvements in both imaging and machine learning techniques.

As networked systems continue to expand in numbers as well as in complexity, so does the threat of malicious activity and the necessity for advanced cybersecurity solutions. Furthermore, both the quantity and quality of available data on malicious content as well as the fact that malicious activity continuously evolves makes automated protection systems for this type of environment particularly challenging. Not only is the data quality a concern, but the volume of the data can be quite small for some of the classes. This creates a class imbalance in the data used to train a classifier; however, many classifiers are not well equipped to deal with class imbalance. One such example is detecting malicious HMTL files from static features. Unfortunately, collecting malicious HMTL files is extremely difficult and can be quite noisy from HTML files being mislabeled. This paper evaluates a specific application that is afflicted by these modern cybersecurity challenges: detection of malicious HTML files. Previous work presented a general framework for malicious HTML file classification that we modify in this work to use a \u03c72 feature selection technique and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). We experiment with different classifiers (i.e., AdaBoost, Gentle-Boost, RobustBoost, RusBoost, and Random Forest) and a pure detection model (i.e., Isolation Forest). We benchmark the different classifiers using SMOTE on a real dataset that contains a limited number of malicious files (40) with respect to the normal files (7,263). It was found that the modified framework performed better than the previous framework's results. However, additional evidence was found to imply that algorithms which train on both the normal and malicious samples are likely overtraining to the malicious distribution. We demonstrate the likely overtraining by determining that a subset of the malicious files, while suspicious, did not come from a malicious source.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/AICCSA.2018.8612855", "venue": "2018 IEEE/ACS 15th International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA)", "journal": "2018 IEEE/ACS 15th International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2909060231", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14740245", "21410823", "14636557", "206577177", "1554582", "53807573", "6505449", "60993494", "89141", "6644398", "14723701", "10620060", "16228746", "11046687", "44232781", "6086494", "70210201", "16848555", "14237737", "25518485", "18964453", "207673395"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:58671857"}

Meanwhile, some random walk based NRL methods are dissatisfactory to learn link knowledge in dense networks with large scales. In this paper, we propose a predictive representation learning (PRL) model, which unifies node representations and motif-based structures, to improve prediction ability of NRL.

Distance measures have been used as natural measures of (dis)similarity and have served as the foundation of various learning methods. The efficiency of distance-based learning methods heavily depends on the chosen distance metric. With increasing dimensionality and complexity of data, however, traditional metric learning methods suffer from poor scalability, and the limitation due to linearity as the true signals are usually embedded within a low-dimensional nonlinear subspace. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear sparse metric learning algorithm via boosting. We restructure a global optimization problem into a forward stage-wise learning of weak learners based on a rank-one decomposition of the weight matrix in the Mahalanobis distance metric. A gradient-boosting algorithm is devised to obtain a sparse rank-one update of the weight matrix at each step. Nonlinear features are learned by a hierarchical expansion of interactions incorporated within the boosting algorithm. Meanwhile, an early stopping rule is imposed to control the overall complexity of the learned metric. As a result, our approach guarantees three desirable properties of the final metric: positive semi-definiteness, low rank and element-wise sparsity.

The DNA sequence is first converted to a 59-dimensional feature vector where each element corresponds to the relative synonymous usage frequency of a codon. As the input to the classifier is independent of sequence length and variance, our approach is useful when the sequences to be classified are of different lengths, a condition that homology-based methods tend to fail. The method is demonstrated by using 1,841 Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) sequences which are classified into two major classes: HLA-I and HLA-II; each major class is further subdivided into sub-groups of HLA-I and HLA-II molecules. Using codon usage frequencies, binary SVM achieved accuracy rate of 99.3% for HLA major class classification and multi-class SVM achieved accuracy rates of 99.73% and 98.38% for sub-class classification of HLA-I and HLA-II molecules, respectively.

Clinically, the AF episode is recognized in an electrocardiogram. However, detection of asymptomatic AF, which requires a long-term monitoring, is more efficient when based on irregularity of beat-to-beat intervals estimated by the heart rate (HR) features. Automated classification of heartbeats into AF and non-AF by means of the Lagrangian Support Vector Machine has been proposed. The classifier input vector consisted of sixteen features, including four coefficients very sensitive to beat-to-beat heart changes, taken from the fetal heart rate analysis in perinatal medicine. Effectiveness of the proposed classifier has been verified on the MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database. Designing of the LSVM classifier using very large number of feature vectors requires extreme computational efforts. Therefore, an original approach has been proposed to determine a training set of the smallest possible size that still would guarantee a high quality of AF detection.

The traditional fault diagnosis algorithms mostly require enough training samples. However, in many cases it can be difficult and expensive in some scenarios. In this paper, the auxiliary domain data are used to train the learner and a novel heterogeneous transfer learning method is proposed for fault diagnosis. Data from source domain and target domain are represented by heterogeneous characteristics of different dimensions in heterogeneous transfer learning. We project the source domain and the target domain into the same feature space through two different auto-encoders. Then the similarity of distribution between source domain and target domain could be evaluated. The concept of distance to the center of the domain is introduced to evaluate the similarity of distribution between source domain and target domain. Firstly, it is introduced into the projection process using a small number of target domain labeled samples supervised training sparse auto-encoders (SAEs). Then, the second encoder is used to extract further features. Finally, the source domain data was used to train SVM, and use it to diagnose the target domain data. The experiment result shows that classifier trained by different auxiliary domain data have different performance for target data.

We propose a two-stage saliency map extraction method to highlight bleeding regions where the first-stage saliency map is created by means of different color channels mixer and the second-stage saliency map is obtained from the visual contrast in the RGB color space. Followed by an appropriate fusion strategy and threshold, we localize the bleeding areas in the WCE images. Then we extract statistic color features in the corresponding saliency region and non-saliency region respectively and fuse them together to represent the whole WCE images. Finally Support Vector Machine (SVM) is applied to carry out the experiment on 800 sample WCE images. Experiment result achieves an accuracy of 95.89%, sensitivity of 98.77% and specificity of 93.45%.

Some issues faced by investigators of digital crimes when analyzing this type of data include finding the original source of a suspect image, and the responsible for first publishing it. It is also challenging to determine how these objects are related to each other. Recent efforts in developing algorithms to find automatically the underlying relationship among groups of digital media objects with similar content have been explored in the multimedia phylogeny field. A tree structure is used to represent the relationship among these objects, inspired by the phylogenetic trees in biology. Discovering whether these objects came from the same source or from different sources is fundamentally a clustering problem: 1) related objects belong to the same cluster (tree) and 2) unrelated objects should fit in different clusters.

Despite its intrinsic capabilities, the sonic log is not routinely recorded in during well logging. We propose using a method belonging to the class of supervised machine learning algorithms \u2014 Support Vector Regression (SVR) \u2014 to synthesize missing compressional acoustic or sonic (DT) logs when only common logs (e.g., natural gamma ray\u2014GR, or deep resistivity\u2014REID) are available. Our approach involves three steps: (1) supervised training of the model; (2) confirmation and validation of the model by blind-testing the results in wells containing both the predictor (GR, REID) and the target (DT) values used in the supervised training; and (3) application of the predicted model to wells containing the predictor data and obtaining the synthetic (simulated) DT log. SVR methodology offers two advantages over traditional deterministic methods: strong nonlinear approximation capabilities and good generalization effectiveness. These result from the use of kernel functions and from the structural risk minimization principle behind SVR. Unlike linear regression techniques, SVR does not overpredict mean values and thereby preserves original data variability. SVR also deals greatly with uncertainty associated with the data, the immense size of the data and the diversity of the data type. A case study from the Anadarko Basin, Oklahoma, about estimating the presence of abnormally pressurized pore-fluid zones by using synthesized DT values, is presented.

However, the effects of negative premises have rarely been discussed in any detail in the context of inductive reasoning studies concerned with the evaluation of arguments. Investigating the effects of negative premises can undoubtedly contribute to our understanding of inductive reasoning. For instance, cases where the entities in both negative and positive premises belong to the same category are clearly problematic for the category-based induction theory (Osherson et al., 1990) because it is impossible to distinguish between negative premises and positive premises from the categorical viewpoint. In contrast to the similarity and coverage model based on category-based induction theory, Sloman (1993) has proposed a feature- based model based on a simple perceptron. According to Sloman, knowledge of category structure is not required for the evaluation of arguments. Rather, he assumes that argument evaluation is based on a simple computation of feature similarities between the entities of the premises and the conclusion. Thus, Sloman\u2019s feature-based model may be more effective at coping with negative premises than category-based induction theory. However, the psychological validity of Sloman\u2019s model has yet to be tested in terms of processing negative premises. Accordingly, this study examines the validity of feature- based induction theory to handle these cases that are so problematic for category-based induction theory. In terms of model construction, what kind of model can adequately represent the cognitive process of feature-based induction, including negative premises? In addition to Sloman\u2019s (1993) model, Sakamoto, Terai and Nakagawa (2005) have also proposed a feature-based model. While structurally similar, their model extends the learning algorithm in order to cope with negative premises. Moreover, their model utilizes corpus-analysis results to compute feature similarities, rather than the results of psychological evaluations used in Sloman\u2019s model. This means that Sakamoto et al\u2019s model is capable of simulating a far greater variety of entities than Sloman\u2019s model (over 20,000 compared to just 46), because the corpus analysis provides information for an enormous quantity of words. However, when induction of the appropriate category is difficult, then the level of computation involved in the feature similarity comparisons will far exceed the computational capacity of simple perceptrons. This study therefore proposes a modified version of the Sakamoto et al Abstract Various learning theories stress the importance of negative learning (e.g., Bruner, 1959; Hanson, 1956). However, the effects of negative premises have rarely been discussed in any detail within theories of inductive reasoning (with the exception of Osherson et al., 1990). Although Sakamoto et al. (2005) have proposed some computational models that can cope with negative premises and verified their psychological validity, they did not consider cases where category-based induction theory is ineffective, such as when the entities in both negative and positive premises belong to the same category. The present study was conducted to test the hypothesis that, even when negative and positive premises involve same-category entities, people can estimate the likeliness of an argument conclusion by comparing feature similarities. Based on this hypothesis, two computational models are proposed to simulate this cognitive mechanism. While both these models were able to simulate the results obtained from the psychological experiment, a perceptron model could not. Finally, we argue that the mathematical equivalence (from Support Vector Machines perspective) of these two models suggests that they represent a promising approach to modeling the effects of negative premises, and, thus, to fully handling the complexities of feature-based induction on neural networks. Introduction This study is concerned with evaluating \u201carguments\u201d, such as: Collies produce phagocytes. Horses produce phagocytes. Shepherds produce phagocytes. The propositions above the line are referred to as \u201cpremises\u201d while the statement below is the \u201cconclusion\u201d. The evaluation of an argument involves estimating the likelihood of the conclusion based on the premises. Osherson, Smith, Wilkie, Lopez, and Shafir (1990) refer to this kind of argument as a \u201ccategorical\u201d argument, because the predicate (e. g., \u201cproduce phagocytes\u201d) in the premises and conclusion is attributed to one or more entities (e. g., \u201cCollies\u201d, \u201cShepherds\u201d). The premises can also be negative in form (e. g., \u201cPenguins do not produce phagocytes \u201d).

It strengthens the student's understanding by pixel-level translation between echocardiography and theoretically sketch images. Previous research studies split it into two aspects of image segmentation and synthesis. This split makes it hard to achieve pixel-level corresponding translation. Besides, it is also challenging to leverage deep-learning-based methods in each phase where a handful of annotations are available. ::: ::: ::: Methods ::: To address interactive translation with limited annotations, we present a two-step transfer learning approach. Firstly, we train two independent parent networks, the ultrasound to sketch (U2S) parent network and the sketch to ultrasound (S2U) parent network. U2S translation is similar to a segmentation task with sector boundary inference. Therefore, the U2S parent network is trained with the U-Net network on the public segmentation dataset of VOC2012. S2U aims at recovering ultrasound texture. So, the S2U parent network is decoder networks that generate ultrasound data from random input. After pretraining the parent networks, an encoder network is attached to the S2U parent network to translate ultrasound images into sketch images. We jointly transfer learning U2S and S2U within the CGAN framework. Results and conclusion. Quantitative and qualitative contrast from 1-shot, 5-shot, and 10-shot transfer learning show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The interactive translation is achieved with few-shot transfer learning. Thus, the development of new applications from scratch is accelerated. Our few-shot transfer learning has great potential in the biomedical computer-aided image translation field, where annotation data are extremely precious.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC7106869", "pubmed_id": "32256680", "doi": "10.1155/2020/1487035", "venue": "Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine", "journal": "Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3011643018", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["15320873", "125462634", "44114660", "63717849", "7723420", "73510235", "16403706", "2428926", "23892862", "6200260", "19132670", "26516599", "206770979", "3719281", "12803511", "211227", "6635779"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214697324"}

We use the procedure to provide formal and empirical characterizations of compositional structure in a variety of settings, exploring the relationship between compositionality and learning dynamics, human judgments, representational similarity, and generalization.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1902.07181", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2952718306,2918117688,2964060387", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5623056", "1819147", "8360910", "52156937", "3142767", "61812221", "86401581", "333563", "3457087", "14605056", "5917203", "61894598", "15412473", "61077014", "3095388", "1994635", "15659560", "24100971", "9792203", "6628106", "14407620", "1364249", "6683636", "18223267", "14911774", "4737664", "16447573", "18597583", "13548281", "55554073", "10109001", "203279", "59815222", "5677543", "6788781", "14687186", "5541663", "629094", "19115634", "449252"], "inbound_citations": ["195767544", "209521589", "195847902", "214667053", "204900822", "204800642", "207810168", "211247086", "209006454", "186206546", "215238861", "214605898", "209501080", "209202801", "90260325", "209439843", "209316097", "56657917"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67749672"}

The recent trend of research in this area is towards extracting attack strategies from raw intrusion alerts. It is generally believed that pure intrusion detection no longer can satisfy the security needs of organizations. Intrusion response and prevention are now becoming crucially important for protecting the network and minimizing damage. Knowing the real security situation of a network and the strategies used by the attackers enables network administrators to launches appropriate response to stop attacks and prevent them from escalating. This is also the primary goal of using alert correlation technique. However, most of the current alert correlation techniques only focus on clustering inter-connected alerts into different groups without further analyzing the strategies of the attackers. Some techniques for extracting attack strategies have been proposed in recent years, but they normally require defining a larger number of rules. This paper focuses on developing a new alert correlation technique that can help to automatically extract attack strategies from a large volume of intrusion alerts, without specific prior knowledge about these alerts. The proposed approach is based on two different neural network approaches, namely, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The probabilistic output of these two methods is used to determine with which previous alerts this current alert should be correlated. This suggests the causal relationship of two alerts, which is helpful for constructing attack scenarios. One of the distinguishing feature of the proposed technique is that an Alert Correlation Matrix (ACM) is used to store correlation strengthes of any two types of alerts. ACM is updated in the training process, and the information (correlation strength) is then used for extracting high level attack strategies.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "I.

This task is a time consuming one since it is often performed manually by radiologists. This paper presents an automatic postprocessing module to refine the segmentation of deep networks. The label assignment generative adversarial network (LAGAN) is improved from the generative adversarial network (GAN) and assigns labels to the outputs of deep networks. We apply the LAGAN to segment colorectal tumors in computed tomography (CT) scans and explore the performances of different combinations of deep networks. ::: ::: ::: MATERIAL AND METHODS ::: A total of 223 patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) are enrolled in the study. The CT scans of the colorectal tumors are first segmented by FCN32 and Unet separately, which output probabilistic maps. Then, the probabilistic maps are labeled by the LAGAN and finally, the binary segmentation results are obtained. The LAGAN consists of a generating model and a discriminating model. The generating model utilizes the probabilistic maps from deep networks to imitate the distribution of the ground truths, and the discriminating model attempts to distinguish generations and ground truths. Through competitive training, the generating model of the LAGAN can realize label assignments for the probabilistic maps. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The LAGAN increases the DSC of FCN32 from 81.83% \u00b1 0.35% to 90.82% \u00b1 0.36%. In the Unet-based segmentation, the LAGAN increases the DSC from 86.67% \u00b1 0.70% to 91.54% \u00b1 0.53%. It takes approximately 10 ms to refine a single CT slice. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: The results demonstrate that the LAGAN is a robust and flexible module, which can be used to refine the segmentation of diverse deep networks. Compared with other networks, the LAGAN can achieve desirable segmented accuracy for colorectal tumors.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31087327", "doi": "10.1002/mp.13584", "venue": "Medical physics", "journal": "Medical physics", "mag_id": "2946637133", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:155092839"}

Sustainable management of the agriculture is the one of the key factors for the country\u2019s economy. Cutting-edge remote sensing technology provides us the information about the earth surface in different temporal and spatial domain hence is in efficient use for the monitoring and management of agricultural areas. Image classification is commonly performed to derive thematic information from the images therefore it has a great attention by remote sensing scientists to develop new classification methods. There are several factors affecting the accuracy of image classification such as training data and spectral bands. Moreover the integration of ancillary data can improve the image classification accuracy. In this study, three different vegetation indices of RapidEye imagery for the study area located in western part of the Turkey have been used on image classification as additional bands and the sensitivity of these additional bands on image classification accuracy has been investigated. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), and the Normalized Difference Red Edge Index (NDRE) are the three vegetation indices used in this study. Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) have been implemented here as classifiers. Classified images have been assessed using overall classification accuracy and Kappa coefficient. Results demonstrated that the incorporation of these additional bands (three different vegetation indices) increase the classification accuracy for the SVM classification from 83,96% to 86,01 % as overall accuracy, however decrease the classification accuracy for MLC from 80,21% to 73,38%.

The results showed that the performance of the predictive model developed using SVM was superior to the MLR model. Furthermore, the variations of the percentage of qualified fibers with each production parameter were predicted using the established model. The prediction model that resulted can be applied to predict the fiber quality during the refining process in an MDF production mill.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.15376/biores.13.4.8184-8197", "venue": null, "journal": "Bioresources", "mag_id": "2898232848", "mag_field_of_study": ["Materials Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:73662901"}

With the development of the traditional ELM, lots of improved ELM algorithms have been proposed; meanwhile the scope of implementing the ELM has been further expanded from supervised learning, to semisupervised learning and unsupervised learning. However, due to its memory-residency, and high space and time complexity, the traditional ELM is not able to train big data fast and efficiently. Optimization strategies have been employed for the traditional ELM to solve this problem.

This study developed machine learning algorithms, the regression tree (RT) and random forest (RF) algorithms, to predict the mass first flush ratio (MFFn) from seven rainfall-related variables. We also evaluated the prediction performance of the two algorithms and the relative importance of the seven variables in model prediction. The RF algorithm outperformed the RT algorithm in terms of Akaike information criterion (AIC) values. In general, the target variables simulated using the RF algorithm had lower AIC values than did those of the RT algorithm, except for T-N and T-P. The RF algorithm also provided acceptable performance statistics for the MFF10 to MFF20 of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) (R2 = 0.71 and 0.67; Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) = 0.67 and 0.52), chemical oxygen demand (COD) (R2 = 0.70 and 0.71; NSE = 0.66 and 0.62), total organic carbon (TOC) (R2 = 0.70 and 0.63; NSE = 0.56 and 0.57), and total phosphorus (T-P) (R2 = 0.72 and 0.71; NSE = 0.68 and 0.58). Suspended solids (SS) predicted by the RF algorithm showed an acceptable value for R2 (0.68 and 0.64) but a low NSE for the MFF20 (NSE = 0.48). However, the prediction of MFF30 was unacceptable for all target variables. The rainfall-related variables showed different relative importance estimates among the water quality parameters in the MFFn prediction. Results also showed that BOD and COD were closely associated with rainfall intensity (RI). TOC and T-P showed strong relationships with RI and antecedent rainfall (AR). SS was closely related to RI and rainfall duration (Rdur). T-N showed strong relationships with Rdur, respectively. This study demonstrated that the RF algorithm could be a useful tool to predict the MFF10 and MFF20 of BOD, COD, TOC, and T-P on the basis of rainfall characteristics in urban catchments.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.05.079", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Hydrology", "mag_id": "2947044383", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:189964949"}

A concept in \"concept drift\" involved in the field of data mining (DM) and machine learning (ML) studies is referred to the relationship between input features and class variables. In real-life classification problems, a concept can be changed or new concepts may appear over the time. Innumerable data mining classification models, new methods are propounded every day to enhance the solution to this raised issue. In this paper, we have extended our vision to attempt an investigation in resolving the issue of concept drift detection, and carried out analysis for creating a better method to adapt to the newly arriving concepts. We have addressed the issue of concept drifting for mining big data, and presented an evolutionary, concept-adaptive, rule-based approach that classifies novel class instances in \"concept drifting\". The proposed method clusters the big data and extracts decision rules from each cluster for classifying instances with existing classes. For classifying new unlabelled instances, the proposed method first examines and ensures if the new instances belong to the clusters in existence or not. If the new instance does not appear to belong to the existing clusters, we have considered this instance as a novel class instance. Then, we have extracted new classification rules from the new instances data and added these new rules with existing rules.

Therefore, it is highly recommended to determine the toxicity at a certain confidence level, either experimentally or by applying reliable prediction models. To this end, a large dataset was compiled, with the experimental acute toxicity values (pLC50) of 1353 compounds in Daphnia magna after 48 h of exposure. A novel quantitative structure\u2013toxicity relationship (QSTR) model was developed, using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to select the most relevant set of molecular descriptors, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to correlate the selected descriptors with the toxicity data. The proposed model showed high performance (QLOO2 = 0.695, Rfitting2 = 0.920 and Rtest2 = 0.831) with low root mean square errors of 0.498 and 0.707 for the training and test set, respectively. It was found that, in addition to hydrophobicity, polarizability and summation of solute-hydrogen bond basicity affected toxicity positively, while minimum atom-type E-state of \u2013OH influenced toxicity values in Daphnia magna inversely. The applicability domain of the proposed model was carefully studied, considering the effect of chemical structure and prediction error in terms of leverage values and standardized residuals. In addition, a new method was proposed to define the chemical space failure for a compound with unknown toxicity to avoid using these prediction results. The resulting ACO\u2013SVM model was successfully applied on an additional evaluation set and the prediction results were found to be very accurate for those compounds that fall inside the defined applicability domain.

Due to the dynamic motion of aircraft, the aeronautical channel experiences high Doppler shifts and fading due to multipath propagation.

Conventional dimensionality reduction methods can be categorized into stand-alone and hybrid approaches. The stand-alone method utilizes a single criterion from either supervised or unsupervised perspective. On the other hand, the hybrid method integrates both criteria. Compared with a variety of stand-alone dimensionality reduction methods, the hybrid approach is promising as it takes advantage of both the supervised criterion for better classification accuracy and the unsupervised criterion for better data representation, simultaneously. However, several issues always exist that challenge the efficiency of the hybrid approach, including (1) the difficulty in finding a subspace that seamlessly integrates both criteria in a single hybrid framework, (2) the robustness of the performance regarding noisy data, and (3) nonlinear data representation capability. This dissertation presents a new hybrid dimensionality reduction method to seek projection through optimization of both structural risk (supervised criterion) from Support Vector Machine (SVM) and data independence (unsupervised criterion) from Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The projection from SVM directly contributes to classification performance improvement in a supervised perspective whereas maximum independence among features by ICA construct projection indirectly achieving classification accuracy improvement due to better intrinsic data representation in an unsupervised perspective.

In this paper, a binary version of multi-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach is used to detect PROBE attacks in a network. A vector evaluated PSO approach is used in the proposed technique with two objectives i.e., intrusion detection rate and false discovery rate, to guide the process of feature selection. The experiments are performed using the well-known KDD99Cup dataset. Multi-objective PSO approach is used for feature selection from a set of 41 features and Random Forests (RF), a highly accurate and fast algorithm, is used for classification. Empirical results show that the proposed technique outperforms well-known classification and regression techniques in most of the cases.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/SMC.2013.422", "venue": "2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics", "journal": "2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2042251274", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["36482639", "12450423", "14304473", "207721637", "7367791", "866518", "4021089", "10783227", "17343179", "18184207", "9996459", "5586971", "61080988", "89141"], "inbound_citations": ["1548198", "2146712", "67865354", "115205020", "160028206"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:968992"}

Mobile user profiling is to extract a user's interest and behavioral patterns from mobile behavioral data. While some efforts have been made for mobile user profiling, existing methods can be improved via representation learning with awareness of substructures in users' behavioral graphs. Specifically, in this paper, we study the problem of mobile users profiling with POI check-in data. To this end, we first construct a graph, where a vertex is a POI category and an edge is the transition frequency of a user between two POI categories, to represent each user. We then formulate mobile user profiling as a task of representation learning from user behavioral graphs. We later develop a deep adversarial substructured learning framework for the task. This framework has two mutually-enhanced components. The first component is to preserve the structure of the entire graph, which is formulated as an encoding-decoding paradigm. In particular, the structure of the entire graph is preserved by minimizing reconstruction loss between an original graph and a reconstructed graph. The second component is to preserve the structure of subgraphs, which is formulated as a substructure detector based adversarial training paradigm. In particular, this paradigm includes a substructure detector and an adversarial trainer. Instead of using non-differentiable substructure detection algorithms, we pre-train a differentiable convolutional neural network as the detector to approximate these detection algorithms. The adversarial trainer is to match the detected substructure of the reconstructed graph to the detected substructure of the original graph. Also, we provide an effective solution for the optimization problems. Moreover, we exploit the learned representations of users for the next activity type prediction.

Furthermore, these systems use sub-phonetic units, with features computed from short analysis frames (usually 20-30 ms) which cannot capture well the variation present in the speech signal. The work presented in thesis consisted in the development of a speech recognition system based on long-term units. The unit chosen for recognition was the syllable due to its greater ability to catch variation due to coarticulation effects. ::: The proposed system is composed of three blocks: an automatic segmentation procedure, a classification stage and the decoding algorithm. The segmentation procedure uses a rule-based approach to segment the continuous speech signal into syllables, employing as features the energy of the signal, its pitch and harmonicity information. Syllable nuclei are searched for in correspondence to energy maxima, while syllable boundaries are placed at the energy minima between consecutive syllable nuclei candidates. The classification stage uses an multi-class Support Vector Machines classifier to compute the acoustic probability of the segments, given the syllable classes. Several features were used to train the models, both spectral as well as prosodic and long-term information. The best model was obtained as a combination of Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients and modulation spectrogram features, thus showing that features representing different time-spans offer complementary information. The probabilities of the classifier, along with linguistic information coming from an N-gram language model, are then employed in a search algorithm to obtain the most likely syllable sequence. Due to errors produced by the segmentation stage, the decoding algorithm was modified in order to be able to recover from these errors. Several approaches for performing this were evaluated and considerable improvement was obtained. Although our system doesn't arrive at the same recognition rates as state-of-the-art systems, it achieves similar performances to other recognizers, which use more complex architectures and significantly more knowledge sources. ::: In the last part of the thesis, the role of syllabic prominence for speech recognition was explored. Two systems for the detection of prominent syllables were developed and tested on Italian and French, obtaining good results. For combining the information about syllabic prominence in the recognition process, we departed from the classical left-to-right search method in favour for an island-driven approach.

They are important ecosystems that are found on almost half of the African continent and a fifth of the Earth\u2019s surface. They consist of varying densities of grasses and woody vegetation and,due to their complexity, they have been centre stage for a number of land system science debates, such as, equilibrium dynamics, land degradation and desertification, or their contribution to the global carbon cycle, to name but a few. Their significance is directly linked to the numerous recent efforts to map and monitor their land cover as accurately as possible, most commonly by employing Earth observation technologies. A recent case study by Symeonakis et al. (2018), carried out in a southern African savannah covering an area of ~44,000km2, tested the performance of different combinations of Landsat- and PALSAR-based metrics from the dry and wet seasons. They concluded that the combination of multi-sensor and multi-season data provides the best results when mapping the main land cover types of woody vegetation, grasses, crops and urban/bare. Here, we take this work further by testing the performance of 15 similar models, this time based on a combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 metrics from the dry and wet season, using the same study area, training and validation samples (extracted from 0.5 m RGB aerial photography). Our results corroborate the findings of the previous study: the combination of the Sentinel optical and C-band radar data from both seasons yielded the most accurate land cover Random Forests classifications: overall accuracy of 87%, overall k: 0.83. Very high user\u2019s and producer\u2019s accuracies were also found, especially for the woody class (User\u2019s: 93%; Producer\u2019s: 93%), which is of primary concern in these savannah environments, due to its relevance to the land degradation processes that are dominant in the region: bush encroachment, overexploitation for fuelwood and deforestation. Similar to the Landsat/PALSAR study, the models based on SAR data only, were less accurate than the optical models. As anticipated, the L-band PALSAR data used in the previous study performed better in mapping the woody cover than their C-band counterparts, since L-band radiation is able to penetrate through the canopy layer and reach the woody stems and branches more efficiently. However, and interestingly, the Landsat-PALSAR study generally outperformed the Sentinel1/2 study, e.g. reporting the same omission but a 5% lower commission error for the woody class (estimated from the all-parameter model). Additionally, we tested a novel land cover configuration mapping accuracy approach using PlanetScope 3m-pixel data, with the view to assessing the quality of the mapping of landscape configuration (e.g. number of crop paddocks) and not only its composition (e.g. crop vs other cover). For five test areas of 170 km2 each, we performed object-based classifications of the PlanetScope imagery (two images per test area, one from the dry and one from the wet season). The results were less promising than those achieved for land cover composition: as an example, in one of our areas of focus, we determined 30 crop paddocks, 28 of which were of the circular centre pivot type ranging from 0.06 to 0.75 km2. For the same area, we mapped a significantly larger number of paddocks with the Sentinel 2 data, most of which were of the rectangular-shaped type. This discrepancy was attributed to the spectral similarity between the crop and grass land cover types, as well as the averaging effect of the lower spatial resolution of the Sentinel. Our findings, however, suggesting a multi-sensor and multi-seasonal approach, are an important addition to the emerging literature and can be used to guide efforts for achieving a highly accurate savannah land cover characterisation. Future work will investigate the use of the PlanetScope object-based classifications as training of the coarser-resolution models (e.g. Seninel 1- and 2-based metrics), not only for improving the mapping of land cover configuration, but also for mapping fractional cover, e.g. % woody vegetation.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2972962020", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:203077926"}

Further, it exploits the strength of weak ties and meta-data that have been neglected by baselines. The experiments show that SURREAL outperforms state-of-the-art techniques by up to 37% (6% on average) on different multi-label classification problems.

In contrast to the approaches one-against-all and all-pairs that transform a multi-class problem into a set of binary problems, Dichotomy Transformation (DT) converts a multi-class problem into a different problem where the goal is to verify if a pair of documents belongs to the same class or not. To perform this task, DT generates a dichotomy set obtained by combining a pair of documents, each belongs to either a positive class (documents in the pair that have the same class) or a negative class (documents in the pair that come from different classes). The definition of this dichotomy set plays an important role in the overall accuracy of the system. So, an alternative to avoid searching for the best dichotomy set is using multiple classifier systems because we can have many different sets where each one is used to train one binary classifier instead of having only one dichotomy set. Herein we propose Combined Dichotomy Transformations (CoDiT), a Text Categorization system that combines binary classifiers that are trained with different dichotomy sets using DT. By using DT, the number of training examples increases exponentially when compared with the original training set. This is a desirable property because each classifier can be trained with different data without reducing the number of examples or features. Therefore, it is possible to compose an ensemble with diverse and strong classifiers. Experiments using 14 databases show that CoDiT achieves statistically better results in comparison to SVM, Bagging, Random Subspace, BoosTexter, and Random Forest.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.asoc.2018.12.023", "venue": "Appl.

Agricultural management of grasslands (mowing, grazing...) is essential to maintain their biodiversity. However, an intensive use constitutes a threat to this biodiversity. It is therefore important for conservation ecologists to monitor agricultural practices in each grassland from a year to another. Remote sensing is a useful tool for continuous monitoring of vegetated areas at large extents. This talk deals with the classification of grassland management practices using high resolution satellite image time series. In this work, grasslands are semi-natural elements in fragmented landscapes, they are thus heterogeneous and small elements. Our first contribution is to account for grassland heterogeneity while working at the grassland scale by modeling its pixels distributions by a Gaussian distribution. Our second contribution is to measure the similarity between two grasslands thanks to a Gaussian mean map kernel: the so-called alpha-Gaussian mean kernel. It allows to weight the influence of the covariance matrix when comparing two grasslands. This kernel is plugged into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and used for the supervised classification of three management practice types. The dataset is composed of 52 grasslands from south-west France. The satellite data is an intra-annual multispectral time series from Formosat-2. Results are compared to other pixel- and object-based approaches both in terms of classification accuracy and processing time. The proposed modeling showed to be the best compromise between processing speed and classification accuracy. Moreover, it can adapt to classification constraints and it encompasses several similarity measures known in the literature.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2770117785", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:134637681"}

Two main characteristics of typical online prediction tasks include tabular input space and online data generation. Specifically, tabular input space indicates the existence of both sparse categorical features and dense numerical ones, while online data generation implies continuous task-generated data with potentially dynamic distribution. Consequently, effective learning with tabular input space as well as fast adaption to online data generation become two vital challenges for obtaining the online prediction model. Although Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and Neural Network (NN) have been widely used in practice, either of them yields their own weaknesses. Particularly, GBDT can hardly be adapted to dynamic online data generation, and it tends to be ineffective when facing sparse categorical features; NN, on the other hand, is quite difficult to achieve satisfactory performance when facing dense numerical features. In this paper, we propose a new learning framework, DeepGBM, which integrates the advantages of the both NN and GBDT by using two corresponding NN components: (1) CatNN, focusing on handling sparse categorical features.

We are living in an information age with abundant sources that generate information. While this data has the potential to transform every aspect of our life, it is very difficult to analyze and make inference from this huge amount of data. One example of this data deluge is the massive amount of textual data being generated on a daily basis from sources such as newspapers, blogs, tweets and other social network posts, emails, research papers, product descriptions and reviews, online discussion forums, digital libraries, knowledge databases, etc. This thesis tackles the problem of finding the hidden structure behind these collections of text documents and of organizing them better so as to help better navigate this sea of textual data. Traditionally, the techniques used to classify the documents by topic include probabilistic methods such as the naive Bayes classifier, margin-based learning techniques such as support vector machines, and statistical manifold learning methods such as the Fisher information non-parametric embedding. We believe that the set of documents can be represented by points in a high-dimensional space that lie on or near a low-dimensional manifold. Hence, manifold learning or dimensionality reduction techniques can help to recover the underlying manifold and retrieve the inherent modes of variability in the set of documents. This will aid towards effective organization of these documents. Indeed, we find that many popular manifold learning methods perform well at organizing test datasets. We also propose a different view of the local similarity of documents and thereby introduce the Earth Mover's distance as a local distance metric to replace Euclidean distance metric for the distance between the documents. The manifold learning methods, modified to incorporate the Earth Mover's distance, do provide improvement in the results as expected. Finally, we show that the spectral clustering promises to be a useful technique for the purpose of text organization.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2481621624", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62907146"}

Graph kernels provide a powerful means for representing complex interactions between entities, while deep neural networks break through new foundations for the reason that data representation in the hidden layer is formed by specific tasks and is thus customized for network anomaly detection. However, deep neural networks cannot learn communication patterns among network traffic directly. At the same time, deep neural networks require a large amount of training data and are computationally expensive, especially when considering the entire network flows.

In order to solve this problem, a green pepper recognition method based on least-squares support vector machine optimized by the improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO-LSSVM) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the green pepper images are segmented by K-Means method under the Lab color space, and the segmentation images of the target and background are obtained. The processed green pepper image was divided into training and testing samples. Then, the shape and texture features of green pepper targets are extracted separately from the training sample using the hu invariant moment and Tamura texture feature. Meanwhile, in order to reduce the complexity of data calculations and improve the efficiency, the extracted feature vectors are normalized. The feature vector is used as the input eigenvector of the least-squares support vector machine (LSSVM). The particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to obtain the optimal regularization parameter and the kernel function width.

For categorical predictors, like genotypes, the standard metric used in ReliefF has been a simple (binary) mismatch difference. In this study, we develop new metrics of varying complexity that incorporate allele sharing, adjustment for allele frequency heterogeneity via the genetic relationship matrix (GRM), and physicochemical differences of variants via a new transition/transversion encoding. ::: ::: ::: Methods ::: We introduce a new two-dimensional transition/transversion genotype encoding for ReliefF, and we implement three ReliefF attribute metrics: 1.) genotype mismatch (GM), which is the ReliefF standard, 2.) allele mismatch (AM), which accounts for heterozygous differences and has not been used previously in ReliefF, and 3.) the new transition/transversion metric. We incorporate these attribute metrics into the ReliefF nearest neighbor calculation with a Manhattan metric, and we introduce GRM as a new ReliefF nearest-neighbor metric to adjust for allele frequency heterogeneity. ::: ::: ::: Results ::: We apply ReliefF with each metric to a GWAS of major depressive disorder and compare the detection of genes in pathways implicated in depression, including Axon Guidance, Neuronal System, and G Protein-Coupled Receptor Signaling. We also compare with detection by Random Forest and Lasso as well as random/null selection to assess pathway size bias. ::: ::: ::: Conclusions ::: Our results suggest that using more genetically motivated encodings, such as transition/transversion, and metrics that adjust for allele frequency heterogeneity, such as GRM, lead to ReliefF attribute scores with improved pathway enrichment.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6215626", "pubmed_id": "30410580", "doi": "10.1186/s13040-018-0186-4", "venue": "BioData Mining", "journal": "BioData Mining", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2898856197", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["6117989", "4601762", "32183412", "89141", "16162039", "23397174", "4775685", "206182207", "5507142", "214965079", "2977201", "2130307", "19763347", "2812034", "13681248", "9502929", "13426968", "8093136", "29903736", "14874382", "1117445", "789879", "55311", "9807687", "8511545", "52310363", "39730410", "669852", "9168492", "5547406", "19737491", "2514452", "14540409"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53208154"}

The effectiveness and the scalability of time-series mining techniques critically depend on design choices for three components responsible for (i) representing; (ii) comparing; and (iii) indexing time series. Unfortunately, these components have to date been investigated and developed independently, often resulting in mutually incompatible methods. The lack of a unified approach has hindered progress towards fast and accurate analytics over massive time-series collections. To address this major drawback, we present GRAIL, a generic framework to learn compact time-series representations that preserve the properties of a user-specified comparison function. Given the comparison function, GRAIL (i) extracts landmark time series using clustering; (ii) optimizes necessary parameters; and (iii) exploits approximations for kernel methods to construct representations in linear time and space by expressing each time series as a combination of the landmark time series.

More precisely, the discriminative auto encoders build a latent space (manifold) under the constraint that the positive data should be better reconstructed than the negative data. It can therefore be seen as a generative model of the discriminative data and hence can be used favorably in classification tasks.

Therefore, the classification algorithms with excellent performance are needed. To address this issue, a hybrid algorithm of robust principal component analysis (RPCA) combined multigroup random walk random forest (MRWRF) is proposed in this paper.

One of the major concerns in BCI is to have an accurate classification. Classifier tuning is one of the most important techniques to increase classification accuracy. In this paper, a ring topology based particle swarm optimization (RTPSO) algorithm is proposed to tune classifiers. Fitness function of RTPSO algorithm is based on the 10-Fold Cross-Validation (CV) or Holdout methods which are used to evaluate performance of classifiers. Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) and three types of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers are used to classify mental tasks. The proposed method tunes classifiers efficiently and quickly in a minimum of 10 iterations and outperforms the BCI 2003 and 2005 competition-winning methods and other similar studies on the same Graz datasets. Obtained results of the tuned FFNN proved far better than SVMs and classification algorithms of the other studies on the Graz datasets III and IIIb in all the experiments. According to the criterion of the BCI competition 2003 on the Graz dataset III, the maximal Mutual Information (MI) by tuned FFNN is about 0.81 while by the Least Squares SVM classifiers is about 0.73.

Existing efforts ignore a crucial aspect of self-supervised learning - the ability to scale to large amount of data because self-supervision requires no manual labels. In this work, we revisit this principle and scale two popular self-supervised approaches to 100 million images. We show that by scaling on various axes (including data size and problem 'hardness'), one can largely match or even exceed the performance of supervised pre-training on a variety of tasks such as object detection, surface normal estimation (3D) and visual navigation using reinforcement learning. Scaling these methods also provides many interesting insights into the limitations of current self-supervised techniques and evaluations. We conclude that current self-supervised methods are not 'hard' enough to take full advantage of large scale data and do not seem to learn effective high level semantic representations.

Like humans who are capable of understanding information of multiple modalities such as video, text, audio, etc., teaching computers to jointly understand multi-modal information is a necessary and essential step towards artificial intelligence. And how to jointly represent multi-modal information is critical to such step. Although a lot of efforts have been devoted to exploring the representation of each modality individually, it is an open and challenging problem to learn joint multi-modal representation.In this dissertation, we explore joint image-text representation models based on Visual-Semantic Embedding (VSE). VSE has been recently proposed and shown to be effective for joint representation. The key idea is that by learning a mapping from images into a semantic space, the algorithm is able to learn a compact and effective joint representation. However, existing approaches simply map each text concept and each whole image to single points in the semantic space. We propose several novel visual-semantic embedding models that use (1) text concept modeling, (2) image-level modeling, and (3) object-level modeling. In particular, we first introduce a novel Gaussian Visual-Semantic Embedding (GVSE) model that leverages the visual information to model text concepts as density distributions rather than single points in semantic space. Then, we propose Multiple Instance Visual-Semantic Embedding (MIVSE) via image-level modeling, which discovers and maps the semantically meaningful image sub-regions to their corresponding text labels. Next, we present a fine-grained object-level representation in images, Scene-Domain Active Part Models (SDAPM), that reconstructs and characterizes 3D geometric statistics between object\u2019s parts in 3D scene-domain. Finally, we explore advanced joint representations for other visual and textual modalities, including joint image-sentence representation and joint video-sentence representation.Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the proposed joint representation models are superior to existing methods on various tasks involving image, video and text modalities, including image annotation, zero-shot learning, object and parts detection, pose and viewpoint estimation, image classification, text-based image retrieval, image captioning, video annotation, and text-based video retrieval.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2537916383", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:43547823"}

To solve this issue, we propose a Projective Label Propagation (ProjLP) framework by label embedding, which can deliver more discriminating deep labels of samples to enhance representation and classification. ProjLP is originally proposed to improve the transductive prediction results by simultaneously learning a robust projection to remove the unfavorable mixed signs and convert the shallow labels into the discriminating deep ones. By including a regressive reconstruction loss term to correlate the extracted discriminative features with the deep labels, the out-of-sample extension of ProjLP is also presented by delivering a linear neighborhood preserving projection classifier, where the neighborhood preserving power is enabled by sharing the same graph weights in the original embedded deep label space and the approximated label space. Thus, the deep label of each new data can be obtained by embedding it directly onto the classifier. We also show the inclusion method by reconstructing the deep label of new data from the deep labels of its neighbors. To show the deep property of embedded deep labels, a multilayer network architecture of our model is illustrated. Simulations on artificial and real-world datasets demonstrate the validity of our techniques for representation and classification, compared with other state-of-the-arts.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.knosys.2016.12.005", "venue": "Knowl.
