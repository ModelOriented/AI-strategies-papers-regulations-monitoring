A model can be trained in a self-supervised setting on stereo pairs of images, where depth (disparities) are an intermediate result in a right-to-left image reconstruction pipeline. For the quality of the image reconstruction and disparity prediction, a combination of different losses is used, including L1 image reconstruction losses and left\u2013right disparity smoothness. These are local pixel-wise losses, while depth prediction requires global consistency. Therefore, we extend the self-supervised network to become a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), by including a discriminator which should tell apart reconstructed (fake) images from real images. We evaluate Vanilla GANs, LSGANs and Wasserstein GANs in combination with different pixel-wise reconstruction losses. Based on extensive experimental evaluation, we conclude that adversarial training is beneficial if and only if the reconstruction loss is not too constrained. Even though adversarial training seems promising because it promotes global consistency, non-adversarial training outperforms (or is on par with) any method trained with a GAN when a constrained reconstruction loss is used in combination with batch normalisation. Based on the insights of our experimental evaluation we obtain state-of-the art monocular depth estimation results by using batch normalisation and different output scales.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1910.13340", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cviu.2019.102848", "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2980901882", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["59159133", "52076600", "502946", "2255738", "67093055", "299085", "9455111", "49213112", "206596513", "10894094", "206594692", "13058841", "5808102", "6200260", "6099034", "211022860", "6628106", "19187724", "4053393", "10845625", "206771128", "205514", "12803511", "2202933", "51869233", "11758569", "1687220", "10748875", "8229065", "207761262", "3248075", "49658377", "3441189", "5334482"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204950074"}

The randomness and blindness in selecting SVM model parameters artificially could be eliminated by using group intelligent optimizing algorithm. FOA is a kind of group intelligent optimization algorithm. It has some advantages such as global convergence, connotative parallelism and fast operating speed. However, its optimum efficiency is very sensitive to the length of fixed step. In the course of optimizing, if the step is oversize, it will have preferable global optimizing performance and weak local optimizing capability. On the contrary, if the step is undersize, the local optimizing capability would be powerful and it will have the most probability to lapse into local extreme value. Therefore, a kind of algorithm named Diminishing Step FOA is proposed, the step length minishes progressively along with the process of foraging. So that it would have preferable global optimizing capability in early stage and preferable local optimizing capability in later period. And then, a dynamic balance will be achieved between global and local optimizing capability. The experimental results show that the SVM model using DS-FOA has optimal forecast precision and effect.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.487.687", "venue": null, "journal": "Applied Mechanics and Materials", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2070850929", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["14607075", "123759339"], "inbound_citations": ["34916019"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:110446599"}

Specifically, ARTL learns the adaptive classifier by simultaneously optimizing the structural risk functional, the joint distribution matching between domains, and the manifold consistency underlying marginal distribution. Based on the framework, we propose two novel methods using Regularized Least Squares (RLS) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), respectively, and use the Representer theorem in reproducing kernel Hilbert space to derive corresponding solutions.

In this study, we investigated the usefulness of such data to classify grassland habitats in a nature reserve area in northeastern Germany. Intra-annual time series of 21 observations were used, acquired by a multi-spectral (RapidEye) and a synthetic aperture radar (TerraSAR-X) satellite system, to differentiate seven grassland classes using a Support Vector Machine classifier. The classification accuracy was evaluated and compared with respect to the sensor type \u2013 multi-spectral or radar \u2013 and the number of acquisitions needed. Our results showed that very dense time series allowed for very high accuracy classifications (>90%) of small scale vegetation types.

These phenomena have been investigated only in a few studies on a small number of subjects. The aim of this study is two-fold. First, to determine the influence of different window and overlapping sizes on the machine-learning performance using a large database consists of forty healthy subjects. Second, to develop a novel multi-window scheme to accumulate a large number of votes compared to the conventional single-window majority voting to improve gesture recognition accuracy. A large publicly available EMG dataset was used in this study. The window and overlapping sizes were varied between 50ms and 500ms, and between 0% and 80%, respectively. Six machine-learning algorithms, including k-Nearest Neighbor, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest were used to classify six different hand gestures. Results show that the overall classification accuracy can be substantially improved by increasing the window size, overlapping size, and the number of votes in the majority voting strategy (p < 0.05). The maximum accuracy was achieved using the Random Forest algorithm. The two-way repeated measure analysis of variance shows that the proposed multi-window scheme substantially improved the overall accuracy of the machine-learning algorithms compared to the conventional majority voting.

This study presents ANN based computational approach for predicting the one day ahead closing prices of companies from the three different sectors:- IT Sector (Wipro, TCS and Infosys), Automobile Sector (Maruti Suzuki Ltd.) and Banking Sector (ICICI Bank). Different types of artificial neural networks based models like Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN), Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) and Layer Recurrent Neural Network (LRNN) have been studied and used to forecast the short term and long term share prices of Wipro, TCS, Infosys, Maruti Suzuki and ICICI Bank. All the networks were trained with the 1100 days of trading data and predicted the prices up to next 6 months. Predicted output was generated through available historical data. Experimental results show that BPNN model gives minimum error (MSE) as compared to the RBFNN and GRNN models. GRNN model performs better as compared to RBFNN model. Forecasting performance of LRNN model is found to be much better than other three models.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2518486470", "mag_field_of_study": ["Economics"], "outbound_citations": ["18744022", "11540217", "10867117", "26727523", "63238324", "10390993", "43098574", "12259009", "60273182", "10843677", "120454847", "18328687", "15000035", "6327416", "121396949", "40025034", "16935950", "14130297", "9390657"], "inbound_citations": ["25842226"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17920984"}

The data originate from a seven-stand hot strip mill. The suitability of these methods to detect characteristic features to allocate the patterns to specific faults is shortly reviewd. Classification is done with a Support Vector Machine. The results of Empirical Mode Decomposition respectively the Intrinsic Mode Functions are classified by evaluating the results of a cross-correlation. In previous contributions, the authors analyzed the aptitude of selected data-driven methods to detect conspicuous behavior of production plant in the field of non-stationary signals [1].

These methods perform well if the topics of two classes are very similar, but they could lead to misclassifi-cation if the topics are dissimilar. We propose a directory integration approach based on the conditional random fields (CRFs) model, and model the integration process using a finite-state model. The advantage of using CRFs is that the transition features naturally include information about the relations between classes. Our results show that CRFs outperform conven-tional text classifiers.

Typically, features may be corrupted or class labels may be noisy or both. Ignoring noise in the learning process tends to result in an unreasonable model and, thus, inaccurate prediction.

In this paper, we propose a unified robust multilabel learning framework for data with hybrid noise, that is, both feature noise and label noise. The proposed method, hybrid noise-oriented multilabel learning (HNOML), is simple but rather robust for noisy data. HNOML simultaneously addresses feature and label noise by bi-sparsity regularization bridged with label enrichment. Specifically, the label enrichment matrix explores the underlying correlation among different classes which improves the noisy labeling. Bridged with the enriching label matrix, the structured sparsity is imposed to jointly handle the corrupted features and noisy labeling.

Generating face geometric maps from predicted landmark points helps the predicted landmark points to represent the face geometric information, including shape and configuration. The discriminators determine that the given geometric maps are generated from actual landmark points or estimated landmark points. Our proposed network is end-to-end trainable, and only the encoder part is used simply as the facial landmark detector in the testing stage. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we have conducted comprehensive experiments with benchmark data sets. The results have shown that the proposed method achieves comparable performances over recently proposed facial landmark detection methods with a simple and effective facial landmark detection network.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TCSVT.2019.2897243", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2913720370", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2814088", "12986393", "13058841", "27748628", "3351622", "14273023", "36265004", "1033682", "3475382", "32727153", "6383512", "86057", "14911023", "4474165", "21011865", "34667556", "206429151", "18412057", "515423", "62600805", "1734325", "4810698", "608055", "215721", "5783213", "36966643", "15995707", "6965417", "15298586", "27250936", "13716919", "1427578", "33523771", "4639774"], "inbound_citations": ["195776445"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:86830221"}

On the other hand, the TL language model is extracted from large monolingual corpora. This article examines the task of maximising the amount of information extracted from a very limited parallel corpus. Hence, emphasis is placed on the module that learns to segment into phrases arbitrary input text in SL, by extrapolating information from a limited-size parsed TL text, alleviating the need for an SL parser. An established method based on Conditional Random Fields (CRF) is compared here to a much simpler template-matching algorithm to determine the most suitable approach for extracting an accurate model.

However, non-reactive, objective and accurate measurement of everyday cigarette consumption in the wild remains a challenge. This study utilizes a wearable sensor system (Personal Automatic Cigarette Tracker 2.0, PACT2.0) and proposes a method that integrates information from an instrumented lighter and a 6-axis Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) on the wrist for accurate detection of smoking events. The PACT2.0 was utilized in a study of 35 moderate to heavy smokers in both controlled (1.5\u20132 h) and unconstrained free-living conditions (~24 h). The collected dataset contained approximately 871 h of IMU data, 463 lighting events, and 443 cigarettes. The proposed method identified smoking events from the cigarette lighter data and estimated puff counts by detecting hand-to-mouth gestures (HMG) in the IMU data by a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

However, in many real-world applications, there also exist problems of sample selection bias among instances in a domain; this would reduce the generalization performance of learners.

In our previous work, we presented three BF games, and showed how these games helped manage stress better than traditional stress therapy activities, like Paced Breathing. Given the crucial role engagement can play in determining the effectiveness of learning stress self-regulation in our biofeedback games, in this paper we investigate how best to quantify engagement physiologically.

The main objective of this paper is to modify Hilbert-Huang transform using the advantages of nonlinear entropy-based features in the time and frequency domain to reduce the noise effects. In addition, using appropriate entropy-based features will result in restriction the information redundancy and overcoming the need for dimension reduction, for the fault detection of a ball bearing system. To modify the Hilbert-Huang method, the effect of added noise on various types of nonlinear entropy-based features is investigated for each Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) which is extracted by ensemble empirical mode decomposition algorithm. Considering the Approximate Entropy (ApEn) sensitivity to noise, an evaluation index is presented for selecting the proper amplitude of the added noise based on the ApEn and mutual information coefficient of the different IMFs. Subsequently, taking into account of the high capability of permutation entropy (PeEn), ApEn and Marginal Hilbert spectrum Entropy (MHE) in the signal characteristic, a threshold is determined for fault detection based on their values associating with the main IMF which has the highest value of mutual information coefficient. As a result, the entropy-based features related to the main IMF can be used for detection of any deviation from normal operation of ball bearings, regardless of the fault type. Finally, the results show the best rate of classification among the twelve experimental conditions involving normal and various type and severity of bearing faults which is achieved by employing Multi-Class Support Vector Machines (MCSVM) combined with PeEn and MHE values of the first tree IMFs as a composite input vector.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.apacoust.2019.02.011", "venue": null, "journal": "Applied Acoustics", "mag_id": "2918661724", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["198145808"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:115685036"}

Therefore, in this paper, we proposed an enhanced Genetically Optimized Neural Network (GONN) algorithm, for solving multi-class classification problems. We used a multi-tree GONN representation which integrates multiple GONN trees; each individual is a single GONN classifier. Thus enhanced classifier is an integrated version of individual GONN classifiers for all classes. The integrated version of classifiers is evolved genetically to optimize its architecture for multi-class classification. To demonstrate our results, we had taken seven datasets from UCI Machine Learning repository and compared the classification accuracy and training time of enhanced GONN with classical Koza's model and classical Back propagation model.

The representative post-MMP analysis signals were utilised to calculate the power topography over the whole brain and designed as inputs for a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. A statistically significant discriminative accuracy of 86% ( p = 0.002) after a permutation test was achieved. Comparing the system classification performance to that of the ensemble averaging method and the established Independent Component Analysis (ICA), we demonstrated the ability of MMP to represent critical MEG information and, in turn, to mark the abnormality of oscillatory activities under negative stimuli using images of sad faces.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "23623951", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2013.04.010", "venue": "International journal of psychophysiology : official journal of the International Organization of Psychophysiology", "journal": "International journal of psychophysiology : official journal of the International Organization of Psychophysiology", "mag_id": "1977599962", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["44497717"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2306252"}

One is benign_API_list that contains the top popular APIs commonly used in benign apps, and the other malicious_API_list that contains the top popular APIs commonly used in malicious apps. We observe that the set of APIs in benign_API_list is quite different from the set of APIs in malicious_API_list. We apply Random Forest classifier on a dataset of 60,243 apps by using each list as the features of the classifier.

To represent object relationship statistics beyond adjacent pixels, prior work either represents only weak spatial information using the segmented regions, or encodes only global object co-occurrences. In this paper, we propose a unified model that augments the pixel-wise CRFs to capture object spatial relationships. To this end, we use a fully connected CRF, which has an edge for each pair of pixels. The edge potentials are defined to capture the spatial information and preserve the object boundaries at the same time. Traditional inference methods, such as belief propagation and graph cuts, are impractical in such a case where billions of edges are defined.

Delivery of appropriate and quick treatment is mandatory. However, it requires a rapid identification of the invading pathogen. The current gold standard for pathogen identification relies on blood cultures and these methods require a long time to gain the needed diagnosis. The use of in situ experiments attempts to identify pathogen specific immune responses but these often lead to heterogeneous biomarkers due to the high variability in methods and materials used. Using gene expression profiles for machine learning is a developing approach to discriminate between types of infection, but also shows a high degree of inconsistency. To produce consistent gene signatures, capable of discriminating fungal from bacterial infection, we have employed Support Vector Machines (SVMs) based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). Combining classifiers by joint optimization constraining them to the same set of discriminating features increased the consistency of our biomarker list independently of leukocyte-type or experimental setup. Our gene signature showed an enrichment of genes of the lysosome pathway which was not uncovered by the use of independent classifiers. Moreover, our results suggest that the lysosome genes are specifically induced in monocytes. Real time qPCR of the identified lysosome-related genes confirmed the distinct gene expression increase in monocytes during fungal infections.

Regularization based on the elastic net has also been proposed but mainly applied to regression and binary classification problems.

Message Passing Interface (MPI) in a Single Program, Multiple Data (SPMD) programming style is chosen for implementing DGR-ELM. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method.

Most existing methods rely on multi-stage optimizations in a layer-wise manner for iteratively pruning and retraining which may not be optimal and may be computation intensive. Besides, these methods are designed for pruning a specific structure, such as filter or block structures without jointly pruning heterogeneous structures. In this paper, we propose an effective structured pruning approach that jointly prunes filters as well as other structures in an end-to-end manner. To accomplish this, we first introduce a soft mask to scale the output of these structures by defining a new objective function with sparsity regularization to align the output of baseline and network with this mask. We then effectively solve the optimization problem by generative adversarial learning (GAL), which learns a sparse soft mask in a label-free and an end-to-end manner. By forcing more scale factors in the soft mask to zero, the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) can be leveraged to fast and reliably remove the corresponding structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GAL on different datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet ILSVRC 2012.

This paper contributes to closing this gap by optimising the realism of synthetic agricultural images using unsupervised cycle generative adversarial networks, enabling unpaired image-to-image translation from the synthetic to empirical domain and vice versa. For this purpose, the Capsicum annuum (sweet- or bell pepper) dataset was used, containing 10,500 synthetic and 50 empirical annotated images. Additionally, 225 unlabelled empirical images were used. We hypothesised that the similarity of the synthetic images with the empirical images increases qualitatively and quantitively when translated to the empirical domain and investigated the effect of the translation on the factors color, local texture and morphology. Results showed an increased mean class color distribution correlation with the empirical dataset from 0.62 prior and 0.90 post translation of the synthetic dataset.

Here, we present a novel theoretical kernel-based framework for node classification that can bridge the gap between these two representation learning problems on graphs. Our approach is motivated by graph kernel methodology but extended to learn the node representations capturing the structural information in a graph. We theoretically show that our formulation is as powerful as any positive semidefinite kernels. To efficiently learn the kernel, we propose a novel mechanism for node feature aggregation and a data-driven similarity metric employed during the training phase.

Accurate forest resources maps are needed in diverse applications ranging from the local forest management to the global climate change research. In particular, it is important to have tools to map changes in forest resources, which helps us to understand the significance of the forest biomass changes in the global carbon cycle. In the task of mapping changes in forest resources for wide areas, Earth Observing satellites could play the key role. In 2013, an EU/FP7-Space funded project \u201cAdvanced_SAR\u201d was started with the main objective to develop novel forest resources mapping methods based on the fusion of satellite based 3D measurements and in-situ field measurements of forests. During the summer 2014, an extensive field surveying campaign was carried out in the Evo test site, Southern Finland. Forest inventory attributes of mean tree height, basal area, mean stem diameter, stem volume, and biomass, were determined for 91 test plots having the size of 32 by 32 meters (1024 m2). Simultaneously, a comprehensive set of satellite and airborne data was collected. Satellite data also included a set of TanDEM-X (TDX) and TerraSAR-X (TSX) X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, suitable for interferometric and stereo-radargrammetric processing to extract 3D elevation data representing the forest canopy. In the present study, we compared the accuracy of TDX InSAR and TSX stereo-radargrammetric derived 3D metrics in forest inventory attribute prediction. First, 3D data were extracted from TDX and TSX images. Then, 3D data were processed as elevations above the ground surface (forest canopy height values) using an accurate Digital Terrain Model (DTM) based on airborne laser scanning survey. Finally, 3D metrics were calculated from the canopy height values for each test plot and the 3D metrics were compared with the field reference data. The Random Forest method was used in the forest inventory attributes prediction. Based on the results InSAR showed slightly better performance in forest attribute (i.e. mean tree height, basal area, mean stem diameter, stem volume, and biomass) prediction than stereo-radargrammetry. The results were 20.1% and 28.6% in relative root mean square error (RMSE) for biomass prediction, for TDX and TSX respectively.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-7-W3-425-2015", "venue": null, "journal": "ISPRS - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences", "mag_id": "2002698593", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geography"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:129160217"}

Most users consider these documents safe for use. Unfortunately, Office documents can contain malicious components and perform harmful operations. Attackers increasingly take advantage of naive users and leverage Office documents in order to launch sophisticated advanced persistent threat (APT) and ransomware attacks. Recently, targeted cyber-attacks against organizations have been initiated with emails containing malicious attachments. Since most email servers do not allow the attachment of executable files to emails, attackers prefer to use of non-executable files (e.g., documents) for malicious purposes. Existing anti-virus engines primarily use signature-based detection methods, and therefore fail to detect new unknown malicious code which has been embedded in an Office document. Machine learning methods have been shown to be effective at detecting known and unknown malware in various domains, however, to the best of our knowledge, machine learning methods have not been used for the detection of malicious XML-based Office documents (*.docx, *.xlsx, *.pptx, *.odt, *.ods, etc.). In this paper we present a novel structural feature extraction methodology (SFEM) for XML-based Office documents. SFEM extracts discriminative features from documents, based on their structure. We leveraged SFEM\u2019s features with machine learning algorithms for effective detection of malicious *.docx documents. We extensively evaluated SFEM with machine learning classifiers using a representative collection (16,938 *.docx documents collected \"from the wild\") which contains \u223c4.9% malicious and \u223c95.1% benign documents. We examined 1,600 unique configurations based on different combinations of feature extraction, feature selection, feature representation, top-feature selection methods, and machine learning classifiers. The results show that machine learning algorithms trained on features provided by SFEM successfully detect new unknown malicious *.docx documents. The Random Forest classifier achieves the highest detection rates, with an AUC of 99.12% and true positive rate (TPR) of 97% that is accompanied by a false positive rate (FPR) of 4.9%.

In this paper, we propose Multi-Task Multi-modal Semantic Hashing (MTMSH) to index large scale social image data collection with limited supervision. MTMSH improves search accuracy via improving more semantic information from two aspects. First, latent multi-modal structure among labeled and unlabeled data, is explored by Multiple Anchor Graph Learning (MAGL) to enhance the quantity of semantic information. In addition, multi-task based Share Hash Space Learning (SHSL) is proposed to improve the semantic quality. Further, MGAL and SHSL are integrated using a joint framework, where semantic function and hash functions mutually reinforce each other. Then, an alternating algorithm, whose time complexity is linear to the size of training data, is also proposed.

The relation between torso and ankle compensations was obtained using the traditional inverted pendulum method. The use of the ankle joint for balance control implies the real time change of the designed initial gait but presents a lower angle control variation compared to the use of the torso joint which is simpler and more precise but slower and with a lower ZMP compensation range. Combining the two control methods it is possible to achieve better results. To obtain a good stable step it is very important to have a good initial legs trajectory design. With that purpose in mind human-based trajectories were used, leading to smaller control corrections of ankle and torso joints.

Instead of incorporating the stochastic gradient boosting method into ELM ensemble procedure primitively, SGB-ELM constructs a sequence of weak ELMs where each individual ELM is trained additively by optimizing the regularized objective. Specifically, we design an objective function based on the boosting mechanism where a regularization item is introduced simultaneously to alleviate overfitting. Then the derivation formula aimed at solving the output-layer weights of each weak ELM is determined using the second-order optimization. As the derivation formula is hard to be analytically calculated and the regularized objective tends to employ simple functions, we take the output-layer weights learned by the current pseudo residuals as an initial heuristic item and thus obtain the optimal output-layer weights by using the derivation formula to update the heuristic item iteratively.

Promoter recognition is of great significance in determining transcription units, studying gene structure, analyzing gene regulation mechanisms and annotating gene functional information.

In this work, we combined pseudo k -tuple nucleotide composition (PseKNC) with position-correlation scoring function (PCSF) to formulate promoter sequences of Homo sapiens ( H. sapiens ), Drosophila melanogaster ( D. melanogaster ), Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans ), Bacillus subtilis ( B. subtilis ), and Escherichia coli ( E. coli ). Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) algorithm and increment feature selection strategy were then adopted to find out optimal feature subsets.

In the 10-fold cross-validation test, accuracies of 93.3%, 93.9%, 95.7%, 95.2%, and 93.1% were obtained for H. sapiens , D. melanogaster , C. elegans , B. subtilis , and E. coli , with the areas under receiver operating curves (AUCs) of 0.974, 0.975, 0.981, 0.988, and 0.976, respectively.

The SVR-based car-following model performs well in error tests and shows higher prediction accuracy compared to Gazis-Herman-Rothery (GHR) model.

However, existing expert based identification algorithms often suffer in a low recall rate and could miss a large number of valuable samples under conservative filtering standards. The goal of this work is to develop a semi-automated framework based on machine learning as a pilot study to liberalize filtering criteria to improve recall rate with a keeping of low false positive rate. Materials and Methods: We propose a data informed framework for identifying subjects with and without T2DM from EHR via feature engineering and machine learning. We evaluate and contrast the identification performance of widely-used machine learning models within our framework, including k-Nearest-Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression. Our framework was conducted on 300 patient samples (161 cases, 60 controls and 79 unconfirmed subjects), randomly selected from 23,281 diabetes related cohort retrieved from a regional distributed EHR repository ranging from 2012 to 2014. Results: We apply top-performing machine learning algorithms on the engineered features. We benchmark and contrast the accuracy, precision, AUC, sensitivity and specificity of classification models against the state-of-the-art expert algorithm for identification of T2DM subjects. Our results indicate that the framework achieved high identification performances (~0.98 in average AUC), which are much higher than the state-of-the-art algorithm (0.71 in AUC). Discussion: Expert algorithm-based identification of T2DM subjects from EHR is often hampered by the high missing rates due to their conservative selection criteria.

However, their power to distinguish real from chance associations between spatially autocorrelated distribution and environmental data at continental scales has been questioned. Here, this is investigated at a regional (10 km) scale by modelling the distributions of 100 plant species native to the United Kingdom. ::: Location UK ::: Methods SDMs fitted using real climate data were compared to those utilising simulated climate gradients. The simulated gradients preserve the exact values and spatial structure of the real ones, but have no causal relationships with any species and so represent an appropriate null model. SDMs were fitted as generalised linear models or by the Random Forest machine learning algorithm and were either non-spatial or included spatially-explicit trend surfaces or autocovariates as predictors. ::: Results GLMs erroneously detected significant effects (P<0.05) for 86% of null gradient-species combinations, with the highest error for strongly autocorrelated species and gradients and when species occupied 50% of sites. Even more false effects were found when curvilinear responses were modelled, and this was not adequately mitigated in the spatially-explicit GLMs. Non-spatial SDMs based on simulated climate data suggested 70-80% of the apparent explanatory power of the real data could be attributable to its spatial structure. Furthermore, the niche component of spatially-explicit SDMs did not significantly contribute to model fit in most species. ::: Main conclusions The spatial structure in the climate, rather than functional relationships with species\u2019 distributions, may account for much of the apparent fit and predictive power of SDMs. Failure to account for this means that the evidence for climatic limitation of species\u2019 distributions may have been overstated. As such, predicted regional and national-scale impacts of climate change based on the analysis of static distribution snapshots will require re-evaluation.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1111/j.1466-8238.2010.00561.x", "venue": null, "journal": "Global Ecology and Biogeography", "mag_id": "1878708150", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["53122262", "134129692", "3487236", "17672611", "89835604", "14936025", "132854198", "34426229", "16403546", "212422527", "3954333", "14325813", "18151520", "91182804", "13025506", "36590234", "7167966", "18539404", "15929688", "49470925", "210964153"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:84008288"}

Thus, in the context of a real macro-case on money laundering in which the author has collaborated as forensic accountant, this study analyses the database available of the operations carried out between a core company and a set of 643 supplier companies, 26 of which had already been identified a priori by the Judicial Police as fraudulent. Faced with a well-founded suspicion that other suppliers within the network might have committed criminal acts, and in order to better manage the scarce police resources available, machine learning techniques are proposed with two different approaches to detect patterns of fraud. The first proposed approach is the implementation of Neural Network models to the expert-assisted work for the detection of fraud operations. For this purpose, based on machine learning techniques, the network structure used is that proposed by Hastie et al. (2008): The Back-Propagation Network. In the second approach, it is proposed a more ambitious procedure to pattern detection than the previous one, in which Benford's Law (Nigrini and Mittermaider, 1997), a tool to characterize accounting records of the commercial operations between the main company and its supplier, is combined with four models of classification: Ridge Logistic Regression (LG) (Le Cessie and van Houwelingen, 1992), Artificial Neural Networks (NN) (Hastie et al., 2008), Decision Tree C4.5 (DT) (Quinlan, 1993 and 1996) and Random Forest (RF) (Breiman, 2001). Overall, the Random Forest showed the best results with the SMOTE transformation, obtaining 96.15% of true negatives (TN Rate) and 94.98% of true positives (TP Rate). The classification capacity of this methodology is undoubtedly very high.Thus, the machine learning techniques proposed in this paper represent an efficient and objective new tool for detecting fraudulent patterns of behaviour for the investigation of money laundering offences, allowing police investigators to focus the limited economic and human resources available in the judicial processes on those companies under suspicion who present a pattern of behaviour similar to that of previously recognized fraudulent companies. This PhD Dissertation is structured in two parts. On the first part, composed of three Chapters, establishes the theoretical framework on which the research is based. The first Chapter outlines the concept of money laundering and studies the tendency of this crime in Spain. Chapter II describes the process of management and access to information prior to the application of the proposed techniques (Data Pre-processing). Next, Chapter III specifies the methodology applied based on machine learning techniques for the detection of money laundering pattern. The second part is devoted to the presentation of the judicial process and the analysis of the results. After the presentation of the judicial process and the description of the sample, on the Chapter IV are presented the results obtained in the application of the machine learning techniques proposed in the two approaches.

This approach fits better with human performance and allows us to use corpora from multiple languages to test ideas from theories of syntax acquisition and adult sentence production. Our version of this evaluation measure will be called Word Order Prediction Accuracy (WOPA) and it is based on models of sentence production. In production, one has a message that one wants to convey. To model the effect of the message in a rough way, we start with an unordered bag of words made up of words from the utterance that we want to predict, which we call the candidate set. Given this candidate set, the system has to try to predict the order of words in the sentence in a word-by-word fashion. After a word has been produced, it is removed from the candidate set, and the system tries to predict the next word in the sequence. After a sequence has been produced in this manner, we compare the sequence against the actual utterance in the corpus, and record whether it was correctly predicted or not. The Word Order Prediction Accuracy (WOPA) score is the number of correctly predicted utterances out of all the utterances of two words or more (one word utterances only have one ordering). In this article, we will use WOPA to compare six syntax acquisition algorithms based on ideas from work in computational linguistics and child language. For input and testing, we will use utterances from child and parent interactions from twelve typologically-diverse languages. Our goal is to be able to determine which of these algorithms best matches the knowledge that may have yielded these corpora. More generally, we hope that this demonstration will suggest that WOPA can be useful as a general way of comparing computational approaches that use different internal representations. Several algorithms for learning syntactic categories from distributional information were tested against utterances from adults and children in twelve typologically different languages. The evaluation measure that was developed allows one to examine word order constraints over a whole corpus and developmentally. By comparing several different algorithms of varying abstraction against actual corpora of children\u2019s speech, the evaluation measure determined that lexically specific knowledge is more advantageous than more broad-based category knowledge in predicting word order. Introduction There is a growing interest in unsupervised computational approaches to syntax acquisition (e.g., Mintz, 2003; Redington, Chater, & Finch, 1998). These systems collect statistical information from corpora and use that information to extract syntactic categories and constraints. These systems are evaluated by comparing their internal representations with syntactic representations that have been labeled or created by humans (e.g. tagged corpora). To compare these systems to human children, we would need to label child utterances with a set of syntactic representations. Since there is little agreement about the nature of syntactic representations in human children at each point in development (contrast Pinker, 1984, with Tomasello, 2003), it is difficult to use child utterances with computational approaches that are evaluated against human labeled representations. One way to evaluate computational models that does not depend on tagged categories is suggested by connectionist approaches to syntax (Elman, 1990). Connectionist syntax acquisition models learn internal abstractions by making predictions over words. In these systems, the accuracy at predicting the order of words in a sentence is a measure of the system\u2019s language knowledge. One difficulty with scaling these systems up to real corpora is the use of neural assumptions such as gradual weight-based learning. In language models (e.g., n-grams), similar evaluation measures have been used, but since there are not enough constraints to predict the next word from the whole lexicon, researchers have typically looked at performance of these models with a subset of the data (e.g., frequent words). Here, we used prediction as the evaluation measure, but restrict it to the Corpora Computational learners should be tested against multiple typologically-different languages to avoid biases towards particular languages (e.g., English) or particular language typologies (e.g., languages without rich morphology). This is not usually done, because tagged corpora are not always available for different languages. WOPA does not evaluate against human-labeled syntactic tags and can be evaluated against raw word-separated corpora.

We developed a probabilistic model of occupied breeding habitat by statistically linking habitat characteristics within 4 miles of an occupied lek using a nonlinear machine learning technique (Random Forests). Habitat characteristics used were quantified in GIS and represent standard abiotic and biotic variables related to sage-grouse biology. Statistical model fit was high (mean correctly classified = 82.0%, range = 75.4\u201388.0%) as were cross-validation statistics (mean = 80.9%, range = 75.1\u201385.8%). We also developed a spatially explicit model to quantify the relative density of breeding birds across each Greater Sage-Grouse management zone. The models demonstrate distinct clustering of relative abundance of sage-grouse populations across all management zones. On average, approximately half of the breeding population is predicted to be within 10% of the occupied range. We also found that 80% of sage-grouse populations were contained in 25\u201334% of the occupied range within each management zone. Our rangewide population and habitat models account for regional variation in habitat selection and the relative densities of birds, and thus, they can serve as a consistent and common currency to assess how sage-grouse habitat and populations overlap with conservation actions or threats over the entire sage-grouse range. We also quantified differences in functional habitat responses and disturbance thresholds across the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (WAFWA) management zones using statistical relationships identified during habitat modeling. Even for a species as specialized as Greater Sage-Grouse, our results show that ecological context matters in both the strength of habitat selection (i.e., functional response curves) and response to disturbance.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1002/ecs2.1462", "venue": null, "journal": "Ecosphere", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2530607760", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["85720169", "17560965", "19616682", "85786688", "55397648", "83877881", "61332072", "20642707", "15447955", "83554726", "84473217", "41819420", "89141", "83497774", "6929967", "83310438", "34638989", "134748278", "3626971", "116746157", "131793897", "13324644", "198149995", "86413102", "84938878", "15355652", "86460963", "24596318", "7618995", "86534079", "907025", "31610150", "53151689", "7229702", "17734699", "23416742", "15014722", "85194966", "40524267", "33359753", "83840782", "20777502", "83629782", "25938821", "128314093", "6680439", "55160132", "9716976", "84021947", "3093707", "14803773", "53651299", "51735696", "30538778", "82837044", "84921457", "85976995", "39361255", "83740635", "126989797", "8978212", "13777662", "55519914", "84672841", "86213900", "14066845", "18865910", "54491166", "13927118", "86572180", "120834251", "198120268", "54195654", "86843801"], "inbound_citations": ["1398775", "210173901", "215423570", "214933178", "90521117", "89794593", "210944599", "210166033", "202022933", "214843748", "89915622", "90837130", "35560314", "52090027"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:74871425"}

It is the practice of using multiple names to mention the same entity that creates problem while collecting data. For example, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, Father of Nation, is also known as Gandhiji and with other pseudonyms. Synonyms (different names of an entity) can affect the relevance of a search engine. Extracting alias of an entity is significant for various tasks in the web such as automatic metadata extraction, entity disambiguation and social network analysis. In this paper, an alias detection framework is proposed to find alternate names of a given entity through the automatically downloaded web snippets using lexical patterns. The extracted alias names similarity scores are calculated using the string similarity measures and a novel method is introduced for detecting irrelevant alias names by ranking with the help of ELM. It is a learning algorithm for single hidden layer feed forwards neural networks having a generalization performance with a faster learning speed to train neural networks in a single iteration and its ranking performance is examined against Support Vector Machine (SVM). The ELM outperformed in terms of precision, recall and fscore as 17.28%, 90.70% and 0.34% for giving alias dataset better than SVM.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.15866/irecos.v9i7.2308", "venue": null, "journal": "International Review on Computers and Software", "mag_id": "81513472", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59790794"}

However, the intense noise in infrared image has similar appearance and intensity distribution with the dim small target. This may lead to terrible probabilities of detection and serious false alarm rates for traditional small target detection methods. To cope with the disturbance of intense noise, a novel small target detection method based on the cascade sparse histogram feature and extreme learning machine is proposed in this paper. Firstly, top-hat transformation based pre-processing is applied on the infrared image to eliminate most of the background clutter. The top-hat based pre-processing can reduce the computation burden for the subsequent extreme learning machine based classification phase, however, some intense noise might still remain in the pre-processed image. Then, a novel descriptive feature namely the cascade sparse histogram is proposed to describe the characteristics of the target and the noise. Finally, the feature vectors of target and noise are discriminated by the extreme learning machine so the target could be detected. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method not only has outstanding small target detection performance under different backgrounds but also works more stably against intense noise compared with conventional baseline methods.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/imcec.2018.8469743", "venue": "2018 2nd IEEE Advanced Information Management,Communicates,Electronic and Automation Control Conference (IMCEC)", "journal": "2018 2nd IEEE Advanced Information Management,Communicates,Electronic and Automation Control Conference (IMCEC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2893901461", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52892325"}

Laplacian mixture potential functions have previously been applied to CRF. However, Laplacian potentials fail to capture data characteristics where data fluctuations happen very smoothly; so that they even give rise to induction of atypical results due to erroneous modeling of data. Having an additional shape manipulation parameter, generalized Gaussian mixtures (GGM) can model data characteristics and fluctuations precisely. In this paper, we propose to deploy GGM in the CRF framework to formulate the potential functions. Expectation maximization (EM) technique is used to estimate GGM parameters. Belief propagation and stochastic gradient descent algorithms are utilized for CRF inference and training, respectively. We show that proposed GGM feature functions effectively improve labeling accuracy of nature images in comparison with Laplacian mixtures. Qualitative labeling results show that the proposed framework performs well particularly for labeling simple even backgrounds where the Laplacian counterparts impose irregular outcomes. That is, despite Laplacian mixtures, GGM-based feature functions can correctly model smooth image color and texture variations.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/GlobalSIP.2014.7032285", "venue": "2014 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)", "journal": "2014 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing (GlobalSIP)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1991990099", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["277918", "122598442", "9779450", "3069989", "242941", "206590944", "9164049", "5574079", "12917143", "14377459", "207251944", "2656702", "10492299", "15321855", "5245271", "122028907", "122172758", "7709829", "16345215", "14426246", "691081", "2955559"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18738295"}

Due to their low-cost, flexibility and efficiency as well as their widely usage in several critical infrastructure monitoring applications, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are estimated to be extensively used in SG applications. WSNs-based SG networks are vulnerable to different types of attacks and intruders. In order to operate networks in secured environments, in this paper we analyze our Clustered Hierarchal Hybrid-Intrusion Detection System (CHH-IDS) that is responsible for various attacks injected by known and unknown intruders. As False Positives (FPs) and False Negatives (FNs) are the key performance parameters in IDS, we investigate mitigation of FNs through a two-tier intrusion detection approach, which deals with anomaly and signature detection in parallel. In the presence of such a hybrid mode, utilization proportion between the anomaly detection and signature detection models affect the FN performance. In these two subsystems, Random Forest method is used for signature detection over known attacks and E-DBSCAN (Enhanced Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) method is used for anomaly detection over unknown attacks. Through simulations that run on real datasets, we validate that the higher the weight of anomaly detection subsystem (i.e. the lower the weight of the signature detection subsystem), the lower the FN rates experienced by the entire H-IDS system. More specifically, we show that FN rates can be significantly reduced by 20.4% when the weight on anomaly detection subsystem is increased from 60% to 70% while the accuracy is expected to be improved through signature detection subsystem by using the Random Forest which has higher detection rate than the E-DBSCAN method.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IWCMC.2017.7986278", "venue": "2017 13th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)", "journal": "2017 13th International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2738893410", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["62126559", "11693082", "21033845", "13680609", "26241397", "8387143", "54497425", "2250492", "32442701", "6430931", "32396744", "13065119", "898686", "7457579", "195067", "2788655", "14608125", "206551025", "16733681", "15790041", "41505655"], "inbound_citations": ["116060722", "209434336", "53081348", "52934541", "198168773", "53872846", "209066080", "180257452", "149724363", "211056383", "51878381", "53703523", "211677827"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3249625"}

COREL has the consequence of building latent representations that collectively exhibit the quality of natural clustering within the latent space of the final hidden layer, according to a predefined similarity function. Despite being simple to implement, COREL variants outperform or perform equivalently to CCE in a variety of scenarios, including image and news article classification using both feed-forward and convolutional neural networks.

However, manually segmenting and generating semantic labels for RGB-D image sequence or global point cloud will cost a lot of human labors.

While automatic label propagation can help, almost all existing methods were designed for 2D videos which ignore the 3D characteristics of RGB-D images. In this paper, we build a global map for RGB-D image sequence firstly, and then propagate labels on the global map. In this way, we can enforce label consistency over the global scene and require fewer frames to be manually labeled. Also we model the overlap information between images and use a greedy algorithm to automatically choose frames for manual labeling. Experiments demonstrate that our method can reduce manual efforts greatly. For a scene which contains 1831 images, only 22 labeled images can achieve 93 % accuracy for label propagation.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-27857-5_23", "venue": "ISVC", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2266602943", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3718461"}

Forecasting production as well as optimizing future recoveries of gas condensate reservoirs are highly desirable. This is not possible to achieve without accurate determination of liquid dropout viscosity ( \u03bc c ) below the dew point. The focus of research in past decades has been on the development of accurate viscosity prediction models below the dew point pressure to ensure accurate condensate production forecast. Gas condensate production forecast and optimization around wellbore region and condition are complicated due to unique gas condensate behaviour that violates thermodynamic laws. Current methods are based on correlation estimation, however the accuracy of these correlations are less than satisfactory, and root cause is due to the miscapturing of complex behaviour of gas condensate reservoir near the wellbore region. These motivated the consideration of modern numerical approaches such as the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) used in this paper. These methods are considered as more data behaviour oriented, with the capability of capturing the fluid complexity of gas condensate in such conditions. In this study viscosity of condensate phase near the wellbore region was modelled using machine learning techniques including ANN and LSSVM. For this purpose, over 300 viscosity data sets were collected from published literature and experimental studies worldwide. This databank includes API gravity, reservoir temperature, solution gas to oil ratio (Rs), specific gas gravity, fluid compositions and reservoir pressure. Six well known previously published viscosity correlations refined using least-square approach to match the experimental data. Qualitative and quantitative error analysis of developed LSSVM and ANN showed their performance superiority over refined literature correlations.

Vertical surfaces are further classified according to their main orientation by fusing oriented line features, floor-wall boundary features and histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) with a Random Forest classifier. Oriented line features are used to build an orientation map that considers the main vanishing points. The floor-wall boundary feature attempts to reconstruct the scene shape as if it were observed from a bird's-eye view. Finally, the HOG descriptors are aggregated per superpixel and summarize the gradient distribution at homogeneous appearance regions.

In clinical oncology, disease risks are often measured through time-to-event data, such as overall survival and progression/recurrence-free survival, and are often subject to censoring. Risk prediction models based on recursive partitioning methods are becoming increasingly popular largely due to their ability to handle nonlinear relationships, higher-order interactions, and/or high-dimensional covariates. The most popular recursive partitioning methods are versions of the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm, which builds a simple interpretable tree structured model. With the aim of increasing prediction accuracy, the random forest algorithm averages multiple CART trees, creating a flexible risk prediction model. Risk prediction models used in clinical oncology commonly use both traditional demographic and tumor pathological factors as well as high-dimensional genetic markers and treatment parameters from multimodality treatments. In this article, we describe the most commonly used extensions of the CART and random forest algorithms to right-censored outcomes. We focus on how they differ from the methods for noncensored outcomes, and how the different splitting rules and methods for cost-complexity pruning impact these algorithms. We demonstrate these algorithms by analyzing a randomized Phase III clinical trial of breast cancer. We also conduct Monte Carlo simulations to compare the prediction accuracy of survival forests with more commonly used regression models under various scenarios.

More broadly, these theories fail to explain why in day-to-day life human decision-making seems to generally be highly robust and ef- fective while sharply contrasting with normative predictions in the simple, stylized decision tasks commonly used in JDM experiments. This symposium brings together researchers who repre- sent a variety of perspectives on ways cognitive science can inform our understanding of decision biases to address these challenges, with relevance at all three Marr levels of analysis. Malmaud and Tenenbaum, and Dayan both offer computational-level Bayesian accounts that explain decision- making biases as resulting from reasoning with priors that are adapted for real-world or evolutionary-relevant decision tasks. Malmaud and Tenenbaum explain choices in terms of advanced models from the AI planning literature and animal foraging theory. Dayan offers a neurobiological implementa- tion of inference that spans the Marr levels. Other approaches relate to algorithms levels of the Marr hierarchy with links to lower and higher levels. Vul offers an algorithmic description of biases as resulting from cogni- tive limitations associated with reasoning using only a limited number of samples from a posterior over decision parame- ters. Maloney and Chater link high-level decision-making to known properties of perception and cognition, such as scale- invariance. Maloney gives a unifying account of the prob- ability weighting function as arising from the same princi- ples as perception of continuous quantities in psychophysics. Chater explores the origin of subjective utility and tempo- ral discounting through connections to broader cognitive pro- cesses. One general idea that cuts across all these approaches is that human decision-making can be modeled in a unified way as the result of general cognitive principles that offer prin- Keywords: Computational modeling; Rational analysis; Judg- ment and decision-making; Biases and heuristics Summary The question for the symposium is how best to understand bi- ases in decision-making, going beyond traditional judgment and decision-making (JDM) accounts such as prospect theory to take a more modern reverse-engineering perspective bridg- ing rational computational, algorithmic, and neural levels of explanation, and viewing decision-making under risk and un- certainty not just as a simple matter of evaluating lotteries but in the context of cognition more broadly, taking seriously learning, perception, motor control, memory, and action plan- ning. The dominant normative approach to studying decision- making under risk is axiomatic expected utility theory, which argues that any agent obeying seemingly reasonable axioms of choice consistency can be modeled as maximizing the ex- pected utility of its decisions. From decades of research that analyzes people\u2019s choices between simple gambles in the lab, it is known that humans routinely violate these axioms. This has forced decision theorists to adopt descriptive models of choice that lack a normative rational in order to account for observed patterns of choice, the most prominent of which is Khaneman\u2019s and Tversky\u2019s prospect theory for one-shot de- cisions under risk with immediate outcomes and hyperbolic discounting for decisions involving delayed outcomes. There are several challenges not addressed by prospect the- ory and its variants. First, they are silent on the issue of the cognitive mechanisms that are actually responsible for hu- man choice behavior. Second, they do not seem as a prac- tical matter to scale to real-world decision problems, where the space of possible outcomes and actions is not sharply de- fined, the effects of actions are highly uncertain, and the ex- plicit calculation of expected values is impractical. Third, they do not strongly constrain or give an underlying rationale for the probability weighting function, temporal discounting function, or utility function featured in prospect theory.

During a forensic interview, high-stakes deception is very prevalent notwithstanding the heavy consequences that may result. Studies have shown that most untrained people cannot perform well in discerning liars and truth-tellers.Some psychological studies have stated that certain facial actions are more difficult to inhibit if the associated facial expressions are genuine. Similarly, these facial expressions are equally difficult to fake. This has cast light on the possibility that deception could be detected by analyzing these facial actions. However, to the best knowledge of the authors, there is no computer vision research that has attempted to discriminate high-stakes deception from truth using facial expressions. Therefore, this paper aims to test the validity of facial clues to deception detection in high-stakes situations using computer vision approaches.We also note that only a limited number of the existing databases have been collected specifically for deception detection studies and none of them were obtained from real-world situations. In this paper we present a video database of actual high-stakes situations, which we have created using YouTube.We have adopted 2D appearance-based methods as the methodology to characterize the 3D facial features. Instead of building a 3D head model as is the current trend, we have extracted invariant 2D features that are related to the 3D characteristic from nine separate facial regions by using dynamic facial analysis: eye blink, eyebrow motion, wrinkle occurrence and mouth motion. Then these cues are integrated to form a facial behavior pattern vector. A Random Forest was trained using the collected database and applied to classify the facial patterns into deceptive and truthful categories.Despite the many uncontrolled factors (illumination, head pose and facial occlusion) contained in the videos in our database, we have achieved an accuracy of 76.92% when discriminating liars from truth-tellers using methods based on both micro-expressions and \"normal\" facial expressions.

In this paper, we address this problem and propose a Cloud-GAN to learn the mapping between cloudy images and cloud-free images. The adver-sarialloss in the proposed method constrains the distribution of generated images to be close enough to the underlying distribution of the non-cloudy images. An additional cycle consistency loss is used to further restrain the generator to predict cloud-free images only of the same scene as reflected in the cloudy images. Our method not only rejects the necessity of any paired (cloud/cloud-free) training dataset but also avoids the need of any additional (expensive) spectral source of information such as Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery which is cloud penetrable.

Instead of learning the transfer between different modalities, we aim to learn a synchronous latent space representing the cross-modal common concept. A novel network component named synchronizer is proposed in this work to judge whether the paired data is synchronous/corresponding or not, which can constrain the latent space of generators in the GANs. Our GAN model, named as SyncGAN, can successfully generate synchronous data (e.g., a pair of image and sound) from identical random noise.

Most of the earlier research works were carried out on quantitative methods, while few studies have proposed on qualitative methods to improvise the performance of bankruptcy prediction models. The discovery of bankruptcy prediction in a qualitative way is an important task because it depends on the subjective knowledge of the experts. In this paper, a unified framework for qualitative and quantitative bankruptcy analysis using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based ant-miner algorithm is proposed. Three different natured datasets are used to present a trustworthy result. For this experiment, we have collected qualitative_bankruptcy dataset and benchmarked by UCI repository. The proposed method is successfully applied and the performance analysis prove that ant-miner method is better than existing classifiers namely Logistic Regression (LR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) in terms of various performance analysis factors. Furthermore, the proposed ant-miner model is found to be a more suitable method for bankruptcy prediction when compared to other traditional statistical and artificial intelligence techniques.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jksuci.2017.10.007", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2766668450", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["195791122", "201256848", "49657268", "207924716"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:49360230"}

With advantages in model flexibility, computation complexity and interpretability, self-attention is gradually becoming a key component in event sequence models. However, like most other sequence models, self-attention does not account for the time span between events and thus captures sequential signals rather than temporal patterns. Without relying on recurrent network structures, self-attention recognizes event orderings via positional encoding. To bridge the gap between modelling time-independent and time-dependent event sequence, we introduce a functional feature map that embeds time span into high-dimensional spaces. By constructing the associated translation-invariant time kernel function, we reveal the functional forms of the feature map under classic functional function analysis results, namely Bochner's Theorem and Mercer's Theorem. We propose several models to learn the functional time representation and the interactions with event representation. These methods are evaluated on real-world datasets under various continuous-time event sequence prediction tasks.

In this paper, the method of k-means clustering, according to RFM attributes is proposed, based on which the customer value can be more objectively determined. The most valuable customers, as a rule, are the smallest group compared to other clusters, so the problem of class imbalance occurs. In order to overcome this problem, a hybrid Support Vector Machine Rule Extraction (SVM-RE) method is proposed for predicting which customer belongs to a cluster, based on data on consumer characteristics and offered products. The SVM classifier is known as a good predictor in case of class imbalance, but does not generate an interpretable model. Therefore, the Decision Tree (DT) method generates rules, based on the prediction result of the SVM classifier.

Support Vector Regression (SVR) have been successfully used in solving nonlinear regression and time series problems related to building energy consumption forecasting.

The forecasting model is developed using weighted SVR models with nu-SVR and epsilon-SVR. The DE algorithm is again used to determine the weights corresponding to each model. A case of time series energy consumption data from an institutional building in Singapore is used to elucidate the performance of the proposed model. The proposed model can be used to forecast both, half-hourly and daily electricity consumption time series data for the same building.

Here we investigate the performance of a simplified variant of the general-purpose Neural Modeling Fields (NMF) categorization mechanism to infer the correct word-referent mapping in a cross-situational learning scenario that simulates experiments with adult subjects.

A training example consists of a picture of a number of objects accompanied by the utterance of the same number of words.

Assessing the presence and severity of cataracts is essential for diagnosis and progression monitoring, as well as to facilitate clinical research and management of the disease. Methods: Existing automatic methods for cataract grading utilize a predefined set of image features that may provide an incomplete, redundant, or even noisy representation. In this study, we propose a system to automatically learn features for grading the severity of nuclear cataracts from slit-lamp images. Local filters are first acquired through clustering of image patches from lenses within the same grading class. The learned filters are fed into a convolutional neural network, followed by a set of recursive neural networks, to further extract higher order features. With these features, support vector regression is applied to determine the cataract grade.

After pretreatment, a comparison of the Raman spectra between cancer and normal tissues occurred. It was found that the gastric cancerous mucosa showed lower intensities at around 748, 944, and 1520cm-1, while higher at 807 and 1661cm-1, compared with normal tissue. And there was only one peak at 1022cm-1 in the spectra of normal mucosa, while there were two peaks at 1022 and 1052cm-1 in the spectra of cancerous mucosa. Support Vector Machine (SVM) was employed to classify Raman spectra between cancer and normal gastric tissues. A sensitivity of 88.2%, a specificity of 91.9%, and an overall diagnostic accuracy of 90.3% were achieved for discriminating gastric cancer from normal tissues with a Radial Basic Function (RBF) SVM algorithm. The experimental results show that Raman spectra differed significantly between cancerous and normal gastric tissue, which provides the experimental basis for the diagnosis of gastric cancer by Raman spectroscopy technology.

Three probabilistic approaches for the fusion of VIS and IR images are presented. The early fusion at the feature level yields a bimodal feature vector integrating both VIS and IR data, used to feed an SVM-based classifier. An intermediate fusion at the kernel level combines two different monomodal kernels in order to obtain a particularly flexible Bimodal Kernel (BK), we believe more appropriate for heterogeneous VIS and IR data classification with SVM. The late fusion combines matching scores provided by VIS and IR obstacle recognition modules in order to improve the system performance. An important advantage of these fusion schemes is their capability to adapt to the environmental illumination changes and specific weather conditions due to a modality weighting parameter which allows to adjust the decision of the system according to the relative importance of the VIS and IR modalities. Experiments performed on the TetraVision image database showed that all our fusion-based obstacle classifiers outperform both monomodal VIS and IR obstacle recognizers. The matching score fusion with a dynamic weighting scheme provides the best results compared with both early and intermediate fusion schemes using static modality weights. The BK scheme we propose for VIS\u2013IR fusion would need a greater and better balanced database for learning improvement, since the BK has much more hyper-parameters to be simultaneously optimized than the matching-score fusion.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.trc.2013.07.003", "venue": null, "journal": "Transportation Research Part C-emerging Technologies", "mag_id": "2043754073", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["17767563", "52252275", "40456714", "8846258", "38288650", "215653283", "17354127", "122216641", "3785685"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:110594750"}

In this study, a statistical pooling method is proposed to recognize Parkinson\u2019s disease using the vowels. The used Parkinson's disease dataset contains the features of vowels. In the proposed method, the features of dataset are increased by applying statistical pooling method. Then, the most weighted features are selected from increased feature vector by using ReliefF. The classification is applied using the most weighted feature vector obtained. In the proposed method, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithms are used. The success rate was calculated as 91.25% and 91.23% with by using SVM and KNN respectively. The proposed method has two main contributions. The first is to obtain new features from the Parkinson's acoustic dataset using the statistical pooling method. The second one is the selection of the most significant features from the many feature vectors obtained. Thus, successful results were obtained for both KNN and SVM algorithms.

Furthermore, the shorter detection time of our method is guaranteed by reducing the dimension of feature vectors and by limited search of faces on only the skin-detected regions and not on the entire image.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s12530-017-9211-y", "venue": null, "journal": "Evolving Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2777197928", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["42604478", "60728245", "30394898", "207998076", "3259195", "11358386", "158578", "17944708", "122892825", "1919006", "62190121", "30860960", "16926029", "14248614", "21707278", "5164292", "26881819", "14188763", "18341515", "15095500", "8253793", "655170", "9221050", "42281583", "2715202", "13518589", "20212806", "16964936"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:67374151"}

Then modification of feature vectors becomes feasible by removing features that exist only in background areas. Furthermore, a new hyperplane is calculated by using the modified feature vectors.

In this study, we develop a novel machine learning-based predictor called M6APred-EL for the identification of m6A sites. To predict m6A sites accurately within genomic sequences, we trained an ensemble of three support vector machine classifiers that explore the position-specific information and physical chemical information from position-specific k-mer nucleotide propensity, physical-chemical properties, and ring-function-hydrogen-chemical properties. We examined and compared the performance of our predictor with other state-of-the-art methods of benchmarking datasets. Comparative results showed that the proposed M6APred-EL performed more accurately for m6A site identification.

Reporting of results on favourable datasets and sampling error in the estimated performance measures based on single samples are thought to be the major sources of bias in such comparisons. Better performance in one or a few instances does not necessarily imply so on an average or on a population level and simulation studies may be a better alternative for objectively comparing the performances of machine learning algorithms. Methods: We compare the classification performance of a number of important and widely used machine learning algorithms, namely the Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN). Using massively parallel processing on high-performance supercomputers, we compare the generalisation errors at various combinations of levels of several factors: number of features, training sample size, biological variation, experimental variation, effect size, replication and correlation between features. Results: For smaller number of correlated features, number of features not exceeding approximately half the sample size, LDA was found to be the method of choice in terms of average generalisation errors as well as stability (precision) of error estimates. SVM (with RBF kernel) outperforms LDA as well as RF and kNN by a clear margin as the feature set gets larger provided the sample size is not too small (at least 20). The performance of kNN also improves as the number of features grows and outplays that of LDA and RF unless the data variability is too high and/or effect sizes are too small.

In this paper, a new method for Indonesian-Japanese term extraction is presented. In general, this is done in 3 steps: (1) n-gram extraction for each language, (2) n-gram cross-pairing between both languages, and (3) classification. This method is aimed to be able to handle term extraction from both parallel corpora and comparable corpora. In order to use this method, we have to build a classification model first using machine learning. There are 4 types of feature we take into consideration. They are dictionary based features, cognate based features, combined features, and statistic features. The first three features are linguistic features. Dictionary based features consider word-pair existence in a predefined dictionary, cognate based features consider morpheme level similarity, combined features consider both dictionary and cognate based features altogether, and statistic features is used in case the first 3 features fail. The only statistic feature we use is context heterogeneity similarity, which consider the variety of words that can precede or follow a term. For learning algorithm, we use SVM (Support Vector Machine). In the experiment, we compared several scenarios: only linguistic features, only statistic features, or both features combined. The classification model was built from parallel corpora since plenty of term pairs can be extracted from parallel corpora. The size of training data was 5,000 term pairs. The best result was achieved by using only linguistic features and without the preprocessing step. The accuracy was up to 90.98% and recall 92.14%. A testing from comparable corpora was also done with size of 37,392 term pairs where 94 were equivalent translation and 37,298 were not.

The purpose of this study is to predict the associations between antibody features and effector function activities on RV144 vaccine recipients.

Usually, identifying and evaluating movement disorders caused due to neurodegenerative diseases solely depends on a physicians experience. Different diseases having gait abnormalities generate a unique gait characteristic. Traditionally, Fourier analysis is used to understand the gait characteristic, thereby predicting potential diseases. Fourier analysis assumes the gait signal to be stationary, linear and noiseless which is not a reality. To overcome this, Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) is used in this study to quantify gait parameters. RQA has proved to be one of the best tools for non-linear, non-stationary and short length data. It is used to quantify heart rate variability, ventricular fibrillation, wrist pulse and growth of bladder. This paper uses RQA in understanding the dynamics of human gait and the parameters obtained are used as a feature for classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN). This study considered thirteen subjects for the classification of gait signals of patients with Neurodegenerative diseases (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Huntington and Parkinson) and thirteen healthy control subjects using two different classification models like Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN). Features were extracted after statistical analysis and RQA, and Hill-climbing feature selection method was used to optimize the feature set.

In addition, the tax professional is also facing increased competition, constantly advancing technology and a more litigious environment. Tax planning is becoming more complex and the aid that was promised from the development of expert systems has not materialized. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how a tax planner might develop decision rules for determining the capital structure of a closely held corporation by the use of fuzzy logic and neural networks. If these decision rules are based upon the judgment of \"experts\" as they relate to the determination of whether an interest deduction by a closely-held corporation is reasonable in specific situations, less experienced tax planners can benefit from the know-how of the these experts. INTRODUCTION Accounting firms have developed several applications of expert systems in accounting and tax. Specific applications include ExperTAX developed by Coopers and Lybrand, FSA developed by Arthur Andersen and ASQ developed by Arthur Young. However expert systems are not being developed and used in accounting as extensively as they were earlier projected. Many problems have slowed their growth. One such problem was the need to use precise variables generally combined with a linear model. It was soon recognized that experts simply don't use precise variables and linear models. Another problem was that for an expert system to be refined with all of its variables and decision rules, the system had to be known and this was not always true. Two current developments are currently being integrated in the area of expert systems that may help solve these problems. Fuzzy logic is replacing Boolean logic in many new systems. And neural networks are being used to help learn complex systems that are not fully understood. Fuzzy logic was developed to aid computers in solving problems in a manner more characteristic of human expert problem solving. Zadeh (1965) introduced the fuzzy set theory as a branch of classical set theory. It allows for systems with human interaction to tolerate vagueness and ambiguity that is natural in personal judgments. This vagueness and ambiguity should not be confused with the uncertainty that is created by randomness, which is best dealt with using probability. Rather vagueness and ambiguity deal with the imprecise nature of human language. Neural networks are an attempt to mimic the way the human brain learns. Neural nets use a number of simple computational neurons that attempt to behave as a human brain cell would behave. Each neuron receives inputs and processes outputs to other neurons until an output signal is generated. The computer system can perform numerous iterations at high speed that should allow the learning process to be more efficient and possibly give us insights that may have taken human experts years to discover. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how fuzzy logic and neural networks can be used to develop an expert system to aid tax planners in assisting their clients in ambiguous tax planning situations such as determining debt/equity issues of a closely held corporation. If these decision rules are based upon the judgment of \"experts\" as they relate to the determination of what level of debt is reasonable in specific situations, less experienced tax planners can benefit from the know-how of the these experts. These experts could include the judges of tax decisions if we are trying to predict the outcome of a potential case. Internal Revenue Agents would be used if we were trying to predict the possibility of an audit. Experienced tax planners could be used if we trying to evaluate the best method of structuring a complex tax transaction. The use of fuzzy logic allows for any ambiguities that may occur among the experts in their determinations of the variable that go into the decision and the output. \u2026", "year": 2002, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Academy of Accounting and Financial Studies Journal", "mag_id": "1511228222", "mag_field_of_study": ["Economics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:152466100"}

However measuring these properties is highly subjective and difficult, especially for the paediatric population. The use of neuropsychophysiological indexes and covert behaviours in assessing the attractive properties of sensorial stimuli has a long tradition in the domain of affective neuroscience. Ways of measuring range from the use of autonomous nervous system activation patterns, to features extracted from electroencephalographic activity or simple and discriminative reaction time tasks. These measurements provide alternative means for assessing the characteristics of commercial products, overcoming the limitations of self reporting-based research, namely social desirability, and for studying populations unable to provide usable verbal responses (e.g. children). Purpose To find out if this methodology can be used for evaluating the gustatory properties of formulations in order to enhance patient adherence. Materials and Methods Trimethoprim formulations were prepared using NF syrup. Flavour was added afterwards. Participants were stimulated with 3 different flavoured formulations (banana, red berry and neutral) for 10 seconds each while subjected to an EEG recording. The order of presentation was fully counter-balanced between subjects. Subjects rated the different solutions for palatability and intensity. Five seconds of the EEG response for each sample were converted to the frequency domain, and the log power and inter-hemispheric asymmetry were calculated for anterior, central and parietal electrodes. Different algorithms, combining different EEG features, were tested for predictive power regarding palatability and type of formula Results Theta inter-hemispheric activity at parietal electrodes predicted the behavioural assessment of palatability (R2 = 0.35). Moreover, the application of unsupervised learning methods, such as Support Vector Machines, on the log power at different bands from 0 to 12 Hz, could distinguish with up to 95.24% accuracy between flavoured and non-altered solutions. Conclusions This technology can be used in formulation studies that are attempting to enhance the organoleptic properties of a formulation.

However, precise connection between the structure and magnetism in actinide-based materials is currently unclear. In this investigation, we established such structure-property links by assembling and mining two datasets that aggregate, respectively, the results of high-throughput DFT simulations and experimental measurements for the families of uranium and neptunium based binary compounds. Various regression algorithms were utilized to identify correlations among accessible attributes (features or descriptors) of the material systems and predict their cation magnetic moments and general forms of magnetic ordering. Descriptors representing compound structural parameters and cation f-subshell occupation numbers were identified as most important for accurate predictions.

Based on investigation FCMLSM is well suited segmentation method and Random Forest is the most optimum classifier for this problem. This method gives accuracy of 97% and with minimum classification error. The time taken to detect Tumour is approximately 2 mins for an examination (30 slices).", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5370/JEET.2015.10.2.670", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Electrical Engineering & Technology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2160287905", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["62649228", "206438725", "17375885", "2296020", "14972671", "6716458", "11412617", "2018752", "27576942", "12849354", "5928676", "9505101", "13308693", "12460258"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53518037"}

The ML-IT2-FELM uses a hierarchical learning scheme that consists of multiple layers of IT2 Fuzzy Autoencoders (FAEs), followed by a final classification layer based on an IT2-FELM architecture. The core building block in the ML-IT2-FELM is the IT2-FELM, which is a generalised model of the Interval Type-2 Radial Basis Function Neural Network (IT2-RBFNN) and that is functionally equivalent to a class of simplified IT2 Fuzzy Logic Systems (FLSs). Each FAE in the ML-IT2-FELM employs an output layer with a direct-defuzzification process based on the Nie-Tan algorithm, while the IT2-FELM classifier includes a Karnik-Mendel type-reduction method (KM). Real data was collected using three inertial measurements units attached to the thigh, shank and foot of twelve healthy participants. The validation of the ML-IT2-FELM method is performed with two different experiments. The first experiment involves the recognition of three different walking activities: Level-Ground Walking (LGW), Ramp Ascent (RA) and Ramp Descent (RD). The second experiment consists of the recognition of stance and swing phases during the gait cycle. In addition, to compare the efficiency of the ML-IT2-FELM with other ML fuzzy methodologies, a kernel-based ML-IT2-FELM that is inspired by kernel learning and called KML-IT2-FELM is also implemented. The results from the recognition of walking activities and gait events achieved an average accuracy of 99.98% and 99.84% with a decision time of 290.4ms and 105ms, respectively, by the ML-IT2-FELM, while the KML-IT2-FELM achieved an average accuracy of 99.98% and 99.93% with a decision time of 191.9ms and 94ms.

Apart from learning distinct experiences correctly, significant or recurring experiences are expected to be learned better and be retrieved easier. In order to achieve this objective, this paper proposes a user preference-based dual-memory adaptive resonance theory network model, which makes use of a user preference to encode memories with various strengths and to learn and forget at various rates. Over a period of time, memories undergo a consolidation-like process at a rate proportional to the user preference at the time of encoding and the frequency of recall of a particular memory. Consolidated memories are easier to recall and are more stable. This dual-memory neural model generates distinct episodic memories and a flexible semantic-like memory component. This leads to an enhanced retrieval mechanism of experiences through two routes.

Furthermore, in comparison of the SVR, the proposed method only utilizes fewer hyperparameters to construct model, and the overlap factor can be chosen in relatively smaller value than SVR to further reduce more computational time. First of all, distilling the original input space into several regions with fuzzy partition by applying Gustafson-Kessel clustering algorithm (GKCA) is a foundation for data reduction and the overlap factor is introduced to reduce the size of subsets. Following that, those subset regression models (SRMs) which can be simultaneously solved by LSSVR are integrated into an overall output of the estimated nonlinear system by fuzzy weighted.

In this research, we present new data-driven models based on Statistical Learning Theory that were used to forecast flows at two time scales: seasonal flow volumes and hourly stream flows. The models, known as Support Vector Machines, are learning systems that use a hypothesis space of linear functions in a Kernel induced higher dimensional feature space, and are trained with a learning algorithm from optimization theory. They are based on a principle that aims at minimizing the generalized model error (risk), rather than just the mean square error over a training set. Due to Mercer's condition on the kernels the corresponding optimization problems are convex and hence have no local minima. Empirical results from these models showed a promising performance in solving site-specific, real-time water resources management problems.

To achieve this goal, we first used patients\u2019 temporal data in their fine-grain form as opposed to coarse-grain form. Second, we devised novel spike detection features to extract temporal patterns that improve the performance of cost prediction. Third, we evaluated the effectiveness of different types of temporal features based on cost information, visit information and medical information for the prediction task. Materials and methods We used three years of medical and pharmacy claims data from 2013 to 2016 from a healthcare insurer, where the first two years were used to build the model to predict the costs in the third year. To prepare the data for modeling and prediction, the time series data of cost, visit and medical information were extracted in the form of fine-grain features (i.e., segmenting each time series into a sequence of consecutive windows and representing each window by various statistics such as sum). Then, temporal patterns of the time series were extracted and added to fine-grain features using a novel set of spike detection features (i.e., the fluctuation of data points). Gradient Boosting was applied on the final set of extracted features. Moreover, the contribution of each type of data (i.e., cost, visit and medical) was assessed. We benchmarked the proposed predictors against extant methods including those that used coarse-grain features which represent each time series with various statistics such as sum and the most recent portion of the values in the entire series. All prediction performances were measured in terms of Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Results Gradient Boosting applied on fine-grain predictors outperformed coarse-grain predictors with a MAPE of 3.02 versus 8.14 (p Conclusions Leveraging fine-grain temporal patterns for healthcare cost prediction significantly improves prediction performance. Enhancing fine-grain features with extraction of temporal cost and visit patterns significantly improved the performance.

A few such examples include hormone\u2013receptor binding, signal transduction, chaperone activity, antigen-antibody interactions. The disruptions of PPIs may therefore lead to the development of human inherited diseases. There are different analytical techniques to identify amino acid residues in protein interfaces. But they are time consuming, labour intensive and above all very expensive. As an alternative approach to the analytical methods, we have tried to develop machine learning tools to differentiate between protein interface and non-interface amino acid residues. We used sequence- and structure-based features derived from a set of protein hetero-complex structure files from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). We have built supervised predictors based on Random Forests (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We have evaluated them with 10-fold cross-validations. Both of our sequence and structure based RF predictors performed better than SVM based ones. The most predictive sequence- and structure- based features are the attributes which measure sequence conservation at a specified amino acid residue and various other measurements of the amino acid residue's neighbouring charge distributions. Our sequence- and structure-based RF classifiers have been validated by evaluating them against the protein complexes with experimentally proven interaction sites. Our predictors are found to detect the protein interface residues in practice.Availability: http://www.sblest.org/ppi", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.protcy.2013.12.337", "venue": null, "journal": "Procedia Technology", "mag_id": "2022323068", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["30390370"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:108518386"}

It has been demonstrated that information contained in electroencephalography (EEG) signal can be used to identify driving drowsiness. To date, most of work focused on the detection of drowsiness within a session. This hampers the generalization of the trained model to a following session conducted after a few days. As we know, EEG is non-stationary and changes dramatically across sessions, which leads to a great challenge how to establish a model that has a good performance across sessions. In this study, we combined boosting strategy and transfer learning method to establish a model for identifying driving drowsiness states from alertness states based on the features of power spectral density (PSD). The model trained using the data collected a few days ago (session1) was tuned using very small portion of the data collected in the current session can achieve a good performance as tested in the current session (session2). The results demonstrated that the proposed boosting transfer learning method significantly outperformed the support vector machine (SVM) and AdaBoost methods.

Although simply replaying all the previous training samples can alleviate this catastrophic forgetting problem, it not only may pose privacy risks, but also may require huge computing and memory resources, which makes this solution infeasible for resource-constrained IoT devices. In this paper, we propose IL4IoT, a lightweight framework for incremental learning for IoT devices. The framework consists of two cooperative parts: a continually updated knowledge-base and a task-solving model. Through this framework, we can achieve incremental learning while alleviating the catastrophic forgetting issue, without sacrificing privacy-protection and computing-resource efficiency.

The forecasting accuracy of existing methods is universally pretty low. On the basis of full analysis of aircraft assembly's feature, this study proposes a forecasting model based on support vector machine (SVM), which is optimized by particle swarm optimization. It can carry out quantitative prediction of the process' man-hour during aircraft's assembly. Firstly, we decompose aircraft's assembly work by the concept of work breakdown structure. Further, the process parameters related to man-hour were listed and we made necessary correlation analysis of these historical data. Parameters with high contribution are then used as input of forecasting model. A new forecasting model utilizing SVM is proposed, which carries out the process as the minimum research granularity. Its performance is compared with back propagation neural network. The process of automatic drilling & riveting is adopted as an example in order to present and validate the model. Experimental results reflect that SVM has high forecast precision and good fitness, so that it is suitable for small sample prediction.

In our discussion, we attempt to clarify the distinction between reasoning and problem solving, present major theories of reasoning and problem solving, and emphasize the importance of background knowledge in both of these forms of thinking. In discussing the importance of knowledge in reasoning, for example, we offer evidence from studies of expert problem solving that illustrate the importance of background knowledge in facilitating the selection of strategies for successful performance. Moreover, we identify a recurring challenge for theories of reasoning and problem solving, namely, the frame problem (Dennett, 1990; Fodor, 1983). The frame problem involves deciding which beliefs from a multitude of different beliefs to consider when solving a task or when updating beliefs after an action has occurred. Finally, we conclude by suggesting that successful reasoning might be akin to expert problem solving\u2014an iterative and systematic process of pattern detection and classification.

This is an important problem since structured data is amenable to efficient query processing. CRFs are a class of discriminative probabilistic models that are gaining acceptance as an effective computing machinery for text segmentation. An important aspect of CRFs is learning model parameters from labeled training data. Labeling can be a labor intensive process. One can avoid the labeling step by using structured reference tables whose data domains and that of the input text data given for segmentation, coincide. In other words the labels in the training data drawn from reference tables \u201ccome for free\u201d. Inspired by recent work on their use for training HMMs, we developed an unsupervised technique for text segmentation with CRFs using reference tables. Assuming text sequences to be segmented come in batches and sequences in a batch conform to the same attribute order, we build CRF models for each attribute in the reference table, use them to decide the attribute order of a batch of input sequences, derive labeled training data from the reference table according to that order, and train a global CRF model to segment the input sequences in the batch.

Therefore, it is important to monitor such crowd motion for danger warning and prevention. In this work, we utilize a recently introduced framework for simultaneous crowd and structural monitoring based on a novel combination of sensing technologies that includes the employment of structurally mounted Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) Fiber Optic Sensors (FOSs) in conjunction with individually held wearable sensing devices incorporating Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). We propose effective approaches for the estimation of crowd flow and load on pedestrian bridges using advanced machine learning techniques with sensor data extracted from both structural sensors and wearable devices. A key novelty of the approaches presented is the utilization of sensor fusion at both the input and feature level within the machine learning methods used. The machine learning approaches include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM); they are first applied on each of the sensing sources, FOSs and IMUs, individually and then extended for multi-modal data fusion at both the input and feature levels. Data fusion enriches the learning models and enhances the system efficiency and robustness against noise and input data time-shifting errors. The proposed approaches are validated using experimental measurements from a crowd replication scenario run on a small-scaled test bridge. The trained machine learning models demonstrate effectiveness in crowd attribute classification for motion speed and load designation, along with a regression model for load estimation.

Our work aims to interpret Gongchepu automatically into western musical notation-staff, which is more easily accepted by the public. The interpretation consists of two parts: pitch interpretation and rhythm interpretation. The pitch interpretation is easily to solve because there is a certain correspondence between the pitch notation of Gongchepu and staff.

Many feature selection algorithms have been developed including the support vector machine recursive feature elimination procedure (SVM-RFE) and its variants. Support vector machine RFEs are greedy methods that attempt to find superlative possible combinations leading to binary classification, which may not be biologically significant. To overcome this limitation of SVM-RFE, we propose a novel feature selection algorithm, termed as \u201csigFeature\u201d (https://bioconductor.org/packages/sigFeature/), based on SVM and t statistic to discover the differentially significant features along with good performance in classification. The \u201csigFeature\u201d R package is centered around a function called \u201csigFeature,\u201d which provides automatic selection of features for the binary classification. Using six publicly available microarray data sets (downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus) with different biological attributes, we further compared the performance of \u201csigFeature\u201d to three other feature selection algorithms. A small number of selected features (by \u201csigFeature\u201d) also show higher classification accuracy. For further downstream evaluation of its biological signature, we conducted gene set enrichment analysis with the selected features (genes) from \u201csigFeature\u201d and compared it with the outputs of other algorithms. We observed that \u201csigFeature\u201d is able to predict the signature of four out of six microarray data sets accurately, whereas the other algorithms predict less data set signatures.

In this paper, a novel deep ReID CNN is designed, termed Omni-Scale Network (OSNet), for omni-scale feature learning. This is achieved by designing a residual block composed of multiple convolutional feature streams, each detecting features at a certain scale. Importantly, a novel unified aggregation gate is introduced to dynamically fuse multi-scale features with input-dependent channel-wise weights. To efficiently learn spatial-channel correlations and avoid overfitting, the building block uses both pointwise and depthwise convolutions. By stacking such blocks layer-by-layer, our OSNet is extremely lightweight and can be trained from scratch on existing ReID benchmarks.

However, a single descriptor may be insufficient for the visual classification task, due to the high level of intra-class variability coupled with low inter-class distance. Although several studies have investigated methods for combining multiple descriptors by ELM, they predominantly apply a simple concatenation of descriptors before classifying them. This type of descriptor fusion may impose problems of descriptor compatibility, high dimensionality and restricted accuracy. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical descriptors fusion strategy at the decision level (\u201clate-fusion\u201d), which relies on ELM ensembles (ELM-E). The proposed method, denoted as H-ELM-E, effectively combines multiple complementary descriptors by a two-level ELM-E based architecture, which ensures that a more informative descriptors will gain more impact on the final decision. In the first level, a separate ELM-E classifier is trained for every image descriptor. In the second level, the output scores from the previous level are aggregated into the mid-level representation which is conducted to an additional ELM-E classifier. The exhaustive experimental evaluation confirmed that the proposed hierarchical ELM-E based strategy is superior to the single-descriptor methods as well as \u201cearly fusion\u201d of multiple descriptors, for the visual classification task.

This data combination provides an opportunity for biologists to study behaviour at a previously unknown level of detail and accuracy; however, continuously recorded data are of little use unless the resulting large volumes of raw data can be reliably translated into actual behaviour. We address this problem by applying a Support Vector Machine and a Hidden-Markov Model that allows us to classify an animal's behaviour using a small set of field observations to calibrate continuously recorded activity data. Such classified data can be applied quantitatively to the behaviour of animals over extended periods and at times during which observation is difficult or impossible. We demonstrate the usefulness of the method by applying it to data from six cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Cumulative activity data scores were recorded every five minutes by accelerometers embedded in GPS radio-collars for around one year on average. Direct behaviour sampling of each of the six cheetah were collected in the field for comparatively short periods. Using this approach we are able to classify each five minute activity score into a set of three key behaviour (feeding, mobile and stationary), creating a continuous behavioural sequence for the entire period for which the collars were deployed. Evaluation of our classifier with cross-validation shows the accuracy to be , but that the accuracy for individual classes is reduced with decreasing sample size of direct observations. We demonstrate how these processed data can be used to study behaviour identifying seasonal and gender differences in daily activity and feeding times.

In this work we perform an exhaustive study of the performance of the different ECA rules when applied to pattern recognition of time-independent input signals using a RC scheme. Once the different ECA rules have been tested, the most accurate one (rule 90) is selected to implement a digital circuit. Rule 90 is easily reproduced using a reduced set of XOR gates and shift-registers, thus representing a high-performance alternative for RC hardware implementation in terms of processing time, circuit area, power dissipation and system accuracy. The model (both in software and its hardware implementation) has been tested using a pattern recognition task of handwritten numbers (the MNIST database) for which we obtained competitive results in terms of accuracy, speed and power dissipation.

The investigation of said instabilities is concerned with the highly non-linear dynamics. Currently, three main methods are used for understanding of such phenomenon - namely analytical models, experiments and simulations - and all of them are primarily investigated and correlated using human expertise. In this work we claim and demonstrate that a major portion of this research effort could and should be analysed using recent breakthrough advancements in the field of Computer Vision with Deep Learning (CVDL, or Deep Computer-Vision). Specifically, we target and evaluate specific state-of-the-art techniques - such as Image Retrieval, Template Matching, Parameters Regression and Spatiotemporal Prediction - for the quantitative and qualitative benefits they provide. In order to do so we focus in this research on one of the most representative instabilities, the Rayleigh-Taylor one, simulate its behaviour and create an open-sourced state-of-the-art annotated database (RayleAI). Finally, we use adjusted experimental results and novel physical loss methodologies to validate the correspondence of the predicted results to actual physical reality to prove the models efficiency.

Now, the incorporation of prior knowledge into SVMs is the key element that allows to increase the performance in many applications. This paper gives a review of the current state of research regarding the incorporation of two general types of prior knowledge into SVMs for classification. The particular forms of prior knowledge considered here are presented in two main groups: class-invariance and knowledge on the data. The first one includes invariances to transformations, to permutations and in domains of input space, whereas the second one contains knowledge on unlabeled data, the imbalance of the training set or the quality of the data. The methods are then described and classified into the three categories that have been used in literature: sample methods based on the modification of the training data, kernel methods based on the modification of the kernel and optimization methods based on the modification of the problem formulation. A recent method, developed for support vector regression, considers prior knowledge on arbitrary regions of the input space. It is exposed here when applied to the classification case. A discussion is then conducted to regroup sample and optimization methods under a regularization framework.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2007.04.010", "venue": "ICPR (2)", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2039813705", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["319536", "207774682", "60954369", "2698102", "961425", "38581559", "10151608", "14727192", "85843", "93037", "20951", "70866", "6256522", "15081966", "3075333", "18697401", "49743910", "5805926", "35292337", "9792148", "18504373", "14591650", "60532258", "59863287", "118035271", "1536643", "2682584", "3870480", "14542261", "60282629", "1826882", "16186013", "17389921", "8473401", "10656220", "5667586", "3893740", "120597338", "14047864", "62245742", "9756494", "58747689", "15109515", "6674407", "64543020", "46950182", "35730151", "14849462", "44806563", "4659176", "8857323", "14500006", "10531091", "7138354", "28637672", "16268556", "17470669", "18426278", "6066634", "5553697", "14657550"], "inbound_citations": ["209951873", "15494107", "14473645", "195800699", "3253634", "155094160", "14004415", "8855320", "17455203", "59231158", "17000036", "12103870", "4588533", "10082944", "56090140", "17072469", "32163366", "52165787", "13165882", "209428648", "10120088", "18919594", "20850869", "4849833", "15021853", "14120313", "16415557", "14311103", "2990073", "9995095", "14245426", "61715218", "7221563", "3404576", "19684152", "19684152", "16933886", "1680155", "12413891", "27380104", "204800405", "14894961", "199086171", "8242556", "8780099", "215032738", "2483888", "17503986", "4664197", "28713274", "14028502", "32692849", "17134596", "55447471", "28555151", "2517101", "15040317", "13154624", "53677755", "203174291", "57427913", "20218585", "18824454", "215726901", "14124639", "10168801", "15814980", "209489269", "31394528", "14905204", "11515798", "14434538", "5828493", "17249211", "18397465"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:7923463"}

In this paper, we propose a hybrid algorithm to improve the classification success rate of MI-based electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in BCIs. The proposed scheme develops a novel cross-correlation based feature extractor, which is aided with a least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) for two-class MI signals recognition. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed classifier, we replace the LS-SVM classifier by a logistic regression classifier and a kernel logistic regression classifier, separately, with the same features extracted from the cross-correlation technique for the classification. The proposed approach is tested on datasets, IVa and IVb of BCI Competition III. The performances of those methods are evaluated with classification accuracy through a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. We also assess the performance of the proposed method by comparing it with eight recently reported algorithms. Experimental results on the two datasets show that the proposed LS-SVM classifier provides an improvement compared to the logistic regression and kernel logistic regression classifiers.

Low-dimensional demonstration not only delivers a compact tractable search space, but it is efficient to capture general human pose variations. The key contribution of this work is an algorithm of Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) for pose optimization in latent space of human motion. Firstly, we learn the human motion model in low-dimensional latent space using nonlinear dimension reduction technique charting based on hierarchical strategy. Increased dependence provision is carried out using hierarchy strategic measures in charting, which improves accuracy in higher flexibility and adaptation.

In tests, the performance of CNNs is compared to another deep learning application called Long-Short term Memory Networks and Support Vector Machine classifiers with different kernels as well as Naive Bayes classifier. In applications, two concepts (gender classification and emotion classification) have been considered with respect to both instants (single feature extracted from single epoch) and subjects (large number of features extracted from single subject in an emotional state). The resulting performance of the proposed method has also been examined for longer segment statement of 12 s. Experimental data was downloaded from an internationally publicly available dataset called DREAMER. The results show that healthy young females differ from males in amusement such that the difference becomes higher when subject classification is performed. Regarding the combined features extracted from females and males, the other emotional states are clearly discriminated from baseline with considerably high accuracy levels by using CNNs in both instant and subject classification manners. The results reveal that emotion formation is mostly influenced by individual experiences rather than gender. In detail, local neuronal complexity is mostly sensitive to the affective valance rating.

It is known that the eigenvalue distribution of the spatial correlation matrix calculated from a multiple microphone input reflects information on the number and relative power of sound sources. However, in a reverberant sound field, the feature of the number of sources in the eigenvalue distribution is degraded by the room reverberation. In the Support Vector Machines approach, the eigenvalue distribution is classified into two classes (overlapping speech segments and single speech segments). In the Support Vector Regression approach, the relative power of sound sources is estimated by using the eigenvalue distribution, and overlapping speech segments are detected based on the estimated relative power. The salient feature of this approach is that the sensitivity of detecting overlapping speech segments can be controlled simply by changing the threshold value of the relative power. The proposed method was evaluated using recorded data of an actual meeting.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1093/ietfec/e89-a.8.2158", "venue": "IEICE Transactions", "journal": "IEICE Transactions", "mag_id": "2003522884", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["14362546", "48682", "146984383", "9216400", "12004453", "17594593", "11520006", "48217"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:27156083"}

We also examined Principal Component Analysis, using PC scores as input features for the classifiers but the performance was not comparable to other classifiers' results.

However, the generalization ability of SVM is limited when processing classification of high-resolution remote sensing images. One chief reason for this is that the Euclidean distance-based distance matrix in traditional SVM treats different samples equally and overlooks the global distribution of samples. To construct a more effective SVM-based classification method, this paper proposes a multi-scale Mahalanobis kernel-based SVM classifier. In this new method, we first introduce a Mahalanobis distance kernel to improve the global cognitive learning ability of SVM. Then, the Mahalanobis distance kernel is embedded to the multi-scale kernel learning (MSKL) to construct a novel multi-scale Mahalanobis kernel, in which the parameters are optimized by a bio-inspired algorithm, named differential evolution. Finally, the new method is extended to the classification of high-resolution remote sensing images based on the spatial-spectral features. The comparison experiments of five public UCI datasets and two high-resolution remote sensing images verify that the Mahalanobis distance-based method can obtain more accurate classification results than that of the Euclidean distance-based method. In addition, the proposed method produced the best classification results in all the experiments. The global cognitive learning ability of Mahalanobis distance-based method is stronger than that of the Euclidean distance-based method. In addition, this study indicates that the optimized MSKL are potential for the interpretation and understanding of complicated high-resolution remote sensing scene.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s12559-019-09631-5", "venue": "Cognitive Computation", "journal": "Cognitive Computation", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2920531641", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11603031", "64543020", "52910113", "53093622", "215208000", "14607075", "14004071", "7494670", "2133158", "19522384", "54452059", "215192304", "56147960", "30280861", "4705466", "126599528", "125365108", "4063477", "125048640", "19091218", "6752163", "11489285", "47325215", "9296691", "14890981", "18102555", "25566901", "46598491", "36609382", "126368748", "125743782", "132327426", "18059551", "5297867", "42762788", "4712279"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:71146398"}

Methods: Support Vector Machine (SVM) based method is used to construct the model to predict distant failure using 143 lung cancer patients underwent SBRT at our institute. Meanwhile, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Logistic Regression (LR) based methods are applied for comparisons. The clinical parameters for each patient include demographic parameters (4), tumor characteristics (6), treatment faction schemes (2) and pretreatment medicines (6). The total number of clinical parameters is 18. The model construction method consists of two steps: (1) selecting optimal parameter set by a new Clonal Selection Algorithm (CSA); and (2) constructing SVM, ANN and LR based models for predicting distant failure in lung SBRT. Selecting optimal parameter set is considered as a combinatorial optimization problem. The proposed CSA method is one of the evolutionary algorithms that can obtain global optimal solutions, overcoming the limitation of the ranking based selection method that lead to local optimization. In addition, to overcome the effect of imbalanced data in training process, a Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is applied. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy are used to evaluate the performance of the constructed models. Results: The accuracies for ANN, LR and SVM are 70.59%, 72.04%, 75.47%, respectively. The sensitivities for ANN, LR and SVM are 76%, 60.47% and 82%, while the specificities for the three models are 58.14%, 69.77% and 60.47%.

Of 842 spring locations found, 70% (589) were implemented for model training, and the rest of them were used to evaluate the models. The mentioned models were run and groundwater potential maps (GPMs) were produced. At last, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was plotted to evaluate the efficiency of the methods. The results of the current study denoted that RFGA, and RF methods had better efficacy than different kernels of SVM model. Area under curve (AUC) of ROC value for RF and RFGA was estimated as 84.6, and 85.6%, respectively. AUC of ROC was computed as SVM- linear (78.6%), SVM-polynomial (76.8%), SVM-sigmoid (77.1%), and SVM- radial based function (77%).

Here the representation is in the form of templates, a sequence of feature vectors. Typical representation in speech community Mel-Frequency CepstralCoe cients (MFCC) carry both speech-specific and speaker-specific information, so the need for better representation.

However, end-to-end learning that is capable of maximizing the impact of deep learning has yet to receive much attention due to the endemic challenge of neuroimaging caused by the scarcity of data. Thus, this study presents an approach meant to encourage the end-to-end learning of a volumetric convolutional neural network (CNN) model for four binary classification tasks (AD vs. normal control (NC), progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI) vs. NC, stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI) vs. NC and pMCI vs. sMCI) based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and visualizes its outcomes in terms of the decision of the CNNs without any human intervention. In the proposed approach, we use convolutional autoencoder (CAE)-based unsupervised learning for the AD vs. NC classification task, and supervised transfer learning is applied to solve the pMCI vs. sMCI classification task. To detect the most important biomarkers related to AD and pMCI, a gradient-based visualization method that approximates the spatial influence of the CNN model\u2019s decision was applied. To validate the contributions of this study, we conducted experiments on the ADNI database, and the results demonstrated that the proposed approach achieved the accuracies of 86.60% and 73.95% for the AD and pMCI classification tasks respectively, outperforming other network models.

Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) generalizes this problem setting by making weaker assumptions about the labeling information. While each pattern is still believed to possess a true label, training labels are associated with sets or bags of patterns rather than individual patterns. More formally, given is a set of patterns x1, ...,xn grouped into bags X1, ..., Xm, with Xj = {xi : i \u2208 Ij} and Ij \u2286 {1, ..., n}. With each bag Xj is associated a label Yj \u2208 {\u22121, 1}. These labels are interpreted in the following way: if a bag has a negative label Yj = \u22121, all patterns in that bag inherit the negative label. If on the other hand, Yj = 1, then at least one pattern xi \u2208 Xj is a positive example of the underlying concept. The MIL scenario has many interesting applications: One prominent application is the classification of molecules in the context of drug design (Dietterich, Lathrop, & LozanoPerez 1997). Here, each molecule is represented by a bag of possible conformations. Another application is in image retrieval where images can be viewed as bags of local image patches (Maron & Ratan 1998) or image regions. Algorithms for the MIL problem were first presented in (Dietterich, Lathrop, & Lozano-Perez 1997; Auer 1997; Long & Tan 1996). These methods (and analytical results) are based on hypothesis classes consisting of axisaligned rectangles. Similarly, methods developed subsequently (e.g., (Maron & Lozano-Perez 1998; Zhang & Goldman 2002)) have focused on specially tailored machine learning algorithms that do not compare favorably in the limiting case of bags of size 1 (the standard classification setting).

Helitrons belong to the transposable elements (TEs) class II which transpose via a rolling circle mechanism; they are known as potential insertional mutagens. Given that these transposable elements do not have typical characteristics, their identification remains restricted to biological experiments. In addition, their distribution in the same genome is not uniform, which makes their classification a difficult task. Indeed, in the case of helitrons, the frequency of apparition in the same genome differs from one helitron type to another. In this framework, we propose two-steps based on-method to automatically identify and classify the helitron types. The spectral analysis method is then used to characterize these elements. This is done by the Smoothed Discrete Fourier Transform (SDFT) which permits the global localization of latent periodicities in helitrons\u2019 signals. For each helitron type, we prove the presence of various periodicities indicating the existence of microsatellites and minisatellites. As an example, the short repetitive sequences with a size equal to 3 bp are found in the helitrons: HelitronY1_CE and HelitronY1A. In a second step, machine learning is used to classify the helitron families (10 classes) in the C.elegans genome. Subsequently, a prediction method of helitron types is proposed using the combination of features extracted from numerical helitron sequences (the Frequency Chaos Game Signals: FCGS2) and a machine learning technique (the Random Forest: RF). The helitrons features are obtained by the analysis techniques: SDFT (32 values) or CWT (Continuous Wavelet Transform, 64 values). Here, the helitrons database is randomly split into two datasets: training (80%) and testing (20%). As for the machine learning method, we use the Random Forest algorithm under the data analytics platform KNIME. In our prediction system, the features corresponding to the same genome (C.elegans) were proven to be sufficient for successful categorization of helitron families. The accuracy scores over 100 fold cross validation ranged from 78% to 94% with an overall score of 90%.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.bspc.2019.101579", "venue": "Biomed.

Excellent solutions have been demonstrated mostly in image processing applications which involve large, continuous output spaces. There is almost no application of these powerful tools to problems having small dimensional output spaces. Regression problems involving the inductive learning of a map, $y=f(x)$, $f:\\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^m$, with $m$ small (e.g., $m=1$ or just a few) is one good case in point. The standard approach to solve regression problems is to probabilistically model the output $y$ as the sum of a mean function $m(x)$ and a noise variable $\\sigma$; it is also usual to take the noise to be a Gaussian. These are done for convenience sake so that the likelihood of observed data is expressible in closed form. In the real world, on the other hand, stochasticity of the output is usually caused by missing or noisy input variables. Such a real world situation is best represented using an implicit model in which an extra noise vector, $z$ is included with $x$ as input. CGAN is naturally suited to design such implicit models. This paper makes the first step in this direction. Through several artificial and real world datasets, we demonstrate CGAN to be an effective approach for solving regression problems.

The sensitivity of these techniques to the input variables is investigated by testing data sets which include different numbers and types of laser metrics, and by reducing their dimension with principal component and independent component analyses. Whereas usual variables only reflect the vertical distribution, we also integrate the entropy of the horizontal distribution of the point cloud in the laser metrics. The results show that SVR prediction models are of similar accuracy with multiple-regression models but are more robust regarding the metrics included in the data sets.

Research in this field has concentrated on the use of heuristics and supervised machine learning methods to detect trip ends, trip itineraries, travel mode and trip purpose. Until now approaches to inference have relied on the use of fully-validated data. However, respondent burden associated with validation lowers participation rates and reduces the amount of precisely validated data because some people do not validate their trips or misreport them. ::: This thesis consists of two studies. In the first study I propose the application of a semi-supervised method to mode detection from smartphone travel survey data. Semi-supervised methods let researchers and planners use both validated and un-validated data. I compare the accuracy of three popular supervised methods (Decision Tree, Random Forest and Logistic Regression) with a simple semi-supervised method (Label Propagation with KNN kernel). Simple features such as speed, duration and length of trip and closeness of start and end points to transit network are used for model estimation. The results show that the semi-supervised method outperforms the supervised methods in the presence of high proportions of un-validated data and better predicts the observations in the test set. Furthermore, the run-time of the best model among the supervised methods was on average almost 16 times longer than the average run-times of the semi-supervised method. ::: In the second study, I develop a method to infer transit itineraries from smartphone travel survey data. Since the application of semi-supervised algorithms in travel surveys and transit itinerary detection are both in the early stages of development, a supervised approach is taken to tackle the problem of transit itinerary detection. To this end, trip features were extracted from smartphone collected data and transit network information available in the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) format.

Several watermarking techniques were recently proposed by embedding robust watermark into digital images. In general, most of the algorithms focus only on limited attacks to determine the watermark robustness. This study demonstrates an improved watermarking scheme based on encryption of the watermark image by utilising Discrete Rajan Transform (DRT) which is backed by Support Vector Machine (SVM). The encrypting technique is worked out by splitting the actual image into four segments, followed by shifting every individual row in each segment and employing DRT to calculate coefficients of the new rows. SVM, as a classifier, backs the extraction of the watermark image process by enhancing the watermark image detection with maximum possible correlation. Various original images as well as watermark images were employed to evaluate the proposed scheme. Furthermore, the evaluation process for the performance is conducted by experimenting with various attacks as well with normal operation. The experimental results prove that the proposed scheme results in considerable enhancement of security and robustness, making it ideal for security needed applications.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.compeleceng.2017.12.029", "venue": "Comput.

Recent advances in attention mechanism proposed several attention blocks to adaptively recalibrate the feature response.

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective building block for ResNeXt-style backbones, namely discriminative local representation (DLR) module, which allows discriminative local representation learning for multi-scale feature information across multi-parallel branches. Our DLR module contains two sub-modules: channel selective module (CSM) and spatial selective module (SSM). Given an intermediate feature map, the CSM first selectively generates the channel-wise attention maps and recalibrates the response from different branches according to the weight vector calculated by softmax layer. And then, the SSM further captures the spatial discriminative information at different scales respectively and emphasizes the interdependent channel maps. Besides, we place a high-order item during the process of multi-branch fusion and residual connection to enhance the intensity of structure nonlinearity. Various DLR modules can be stacked to a deep convolution network named DLRNet. To validate our DLRNet, we conduct comprehensive experiments on classification benchmarks (i.e. CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet-1K), as well as two publicly available fine-grained datasets (i.e. CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Dogs).

They may not be suitable for odor signal identification. This paper proposes a Sparse Representation-based Classification (SRC) method for breath sample identification. The sparse representation expresses an input signal as the linear combination of a small number of the training signals, which are from the same category as the input signal. The selection of a proper set of training signals in representation, therefore, gives us useful cues for classification. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed method. The first one was to distinguish diabetes samples from healthy ones. The second one aimed to classify these diseased samples into different groups, each standing for one blood glucose level. To illustrate the robustness of this method, two different feature sets, namely, geometry features and principle components were employed.

The assumption that failure always occurs in local bands, the so called 'fracture zones', with the remaining regions of the structure largely unaffected has been visually verified. Researchers agreed that the identification of the weakest link in the trabecular framework can lead to the prediction of the fracture zone and consequently of the failure event. In this paper, a decision support system (DSS) is proposed for the automatic identification of fracture zone. Initially, an automatic methodological approach based on image processing is applied for the automatic identification of trabecular bone fracture zone in micro-CT datasets, after mechanical testing. Then, a local analysis of the whole specimen is performed on order to compare the structure (Volumes of Interest -VOI) of the broken region to the unbroken one. As a result, for every VOI, 29 morphometrical parameters were computed and used as initial features to the proposed DSS. The DSS comprises of two main modules: the feature selection module and the classifier. The feature selection module is used for reducing the initial size of the input features' subset (29 features) and for keeping the most informative features in order to increase the classification's module performance. To this end, the Sequential Floating Forward Selection (SFFS) algorithm with Fuzzy C-Means evaluation criterion was implemented. For the classification, several classification algorithms including the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), the Support Vector Machines (SVM), the Naive Bayesian (NB), the k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and the k-Means (KM) have been used.

Box 20537, 1678 Nicosia, Cyprus. Abstract Conceptual change can be accounted for at various levels of explanation. The cognitive level (Marr\u2019s computational level), the representational (Marr\u2019s \u201calgorithmic\u201d), and the implementational level. In this paper, we offer a dynamical account of types of conceptual change at the representational level. Our aim is to show that some classes of neural models can implement the types of change that we have proposed elsewhere. First we briefly describe at the cognitive level certain types of change that purport to account for some of the kinds of conceptual change. Then we lay forth the framework of dynamical connectionism; we discuss the representational level realizations of the cognitive level and claim that these can be depicted as points in the system\u2019s activational landscape. We offer, third, a dynamical account of some types change and we claim that conceptual change can be modeled as a process of modification, appearance of new and disappearance of attractors and/or basins of attraction that shape the system\u2019s landscape. Finally, we discuss the kinds of mechanisms at the representational level that could produce the types of change observed at the cognitive level, as modeled by means of dynamic connectionism. Introduction Conceptual change can be accounted for at various levels of explanation. Following Marr (1980), one can distinguish between three levels: the computational, the algorithmic, and the implementational level of explanation of cognitive systems. We prefer the term \u201ccognitive\u201d to \u201ccomputational\u201d, and the term \u201crepresentational\u201d to \u201calgorithmic\u201d, since there are accounts of cognition that deny the algorithmic nature of mental operations. At the cognitive level, one can discuss cognitive operations that apply to information-processing content (such as addition and subtraction), operations that apply to structures as wholes, such as differentiation or coalescence (Carey, 1985; Chi, 1992), or, conceptual combination, generalization and abduction, and hypothesis formation (Thagard, 1992). This level addresses the issue of the functions computed by the information processing system. At the representational level one can examine the algorithmic processes that realize conceptual change at the cognitive level by transforming representations, such as Newell and Simon\u2019s (1972) \u201cproblem behavior graph\u201d in production systems. In the connectionist paradigm one can study the processes of the emergence of new attractors, and repositioning of points realizing representational states in high-dimensional state spaces (Horgan and Tienson, 1996), or the changes in the connection weights and network structure (Elman et al., 1996; Schultz et. al., 1995; Plunkett & Sinha, 1992). In this paper, we will discuss a theory of different types of cognitive change and their implementation at the representation level. Our aim is to show how certain classes of neural networks could implement some of the types of change that the authors have proposed (Demetriou and Raftopoulos, 1999). First, we will summarize these types of change. In the second part we will sketch the framework for the dynamics of change, relying on the dynamical interpretation of connectionist networks to explore possible means of modeling the stipulated types. In the third part we offer a dynamical account of some types change and we claim that conceptual change can be modeled as a process of modification, appearance of new and disappearance of attractors and/or basins of attraction that shape the system\u2019s landscape. Finally, we discuss the kinds of mechanisms at the representational level that could produce the types of cognitive change. To that end we will employ neural networks whose behavior can be viewed as falling under one or the other of our kinds of change, and describe the behavior that neural networks should exhibit if they are to implement type of change. Types of Change Demetriou and Raftopoulos (1999) previously published a theory of conceptual change that addresses the issue of how a learning system makes the transition from one state to another. The theory provides a detailed analysis of the types of change that are observed both in cognitive development and during learning.

The proposed approach has been verified on an autonomous vehicle platform. Curb information is used to divide pedestrian candidates into two classes, i.e., on-road and out of road.Tracking aided recognition strategy is used to improve the true positive rate, for example, for those on-road candidates, who have been recognized as pedestrians in former frame are classified to be pedestrians directly.This may increase the true positive rate for candidates who become too close or too far from moving autonomous vehicle in the following frames, where only a few laser beams are irradiated on pedestrians.Hash table is used for searching and comparison in the segmentation procedure to increase the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.The pedestrian recognition and tracking system is integrated with the autonomous vehicle platform which provides timely prediction of pedestrian motions.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.robot.2016.11.014", "venue": "Robotics Auton.

The Luc Yen district in Yen Bai province (Vietnam) has been selected as a case study. LSSVM and MADT are effective machine learning techniques of classification applied in other fields but not in the field of landslide hazard assessment. For this, Landslide inventory map was first constructed with 95 landslide locations identified from aerial photos and verified from field investigations. These landslide locations were then divided randomly into two parts for training (70 % locations) and validation (30 % locations) processes. Secondly, landslide affecting factors such as slope, aspect, elevation, curvature, lithology, land use, distance to roads, distance to faults, distance to rivers, and rainfall were selected and applied for landslide susceptibility assessment. Subsequently, the LSSVM and MADT models were built to assess the landslide susceptibility in the study area using training dataset. Finally, receiver operating characteristic curve and statistical index-based evaluations techniques were employed to validate the predictive capability of these models. As a result, both the LSSVM and MADT models have high performance for spatial prediction of landslides in the study area.

A non-parametric dependency measure (MI) based spectral segmentation is proposed instead of linear and parametric dependency measure to take care of both linear and nonlinear inter-band dependency for spectral segmentation of the HS bands. Then morphological profiles are created corresponding to segmented spectral features to assimilate the spatial information in the spectral-spatial classification approach. Two non-parametric classifiers, Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Gaussian kernel and Random Forest (RF) are used for classification of the three most popularly used HS datasets. Results of the numerical experiments carried out in this study have shown that SVM with a Gaussian kernel is providing better results for the Pavia University and Botswana datasets whereas RF is performing better for Indian Pines dataset.

We consider a family of spatial verification methods and decompose them into fundamental constraints imposed on pairs of feature correspondences. Encompassing such constraints leads us to propose a new method, which takes the best of existing techniques and functions as a unified Ensemble of pAirwise GEometric Relations (EAGER), in terms of both spatial contexts and between-image transformations. We also introduce a novel and robust reranking method, in which the object instances localized by EAGER in high-ranked database images are reissued as new queries. EAGER is extended to develop a smoothness constraint where the similarity between the optimized ranking scores of two instances should be maximally consistent with their geometrically constrained similarity. Reranking is newly formulated as two label propagation problems: one is to assess the confidence of new queries and the other to aggregate new independently executed retrievals.

It only considers the punishment constraints, but does not introduce the within-class and between-class constraint projections. A novel robust discriminative support vector machines algorithm with pairwise constraint projections called CPSVM is discussed for linearly separable and linearly non-separable datasets. CPSVM can preserve the structure of the original samples data as well as the pairwise constraints in the projective feature spaces. The central idea is to find a projective vector such that can assure the maximum margin of SVM hyperplane, and simultaneously considers improving the tightness among the distances between the similar patterns under the must-link constraints, while expanding the distances between those dissimilar pairs under the cannot-link constraints after the restricted data are projected onto the projection vector in the high-dimensional kernel spaces. The projection process can make the nonlinear data separable in the feature spaces.

In order to solve the problem of labeling samples difficulty and costly, poor sample validity, and continuous iterative learning in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image classification, we propose an online active extreme learning machine (OA-ELM) algorithm to combine the strengths and make up the weaknesses of OS-ELM and AL-ELM, which improves both efficiency and generalization ability.

Specifically, OA-ELM reduces time and memory cost for training via extended recursive least squares for optimization. It also improves accuracy using informative training samples selected by proposed discrepancy sampling (DS), which modifies an active query method called margin sampling (MS). Before applying MS to ELM, real-valued outputs of ELM need to be converted into probabilistic outputs first.

In this work, we computed a set of 6,553 input features and used them to compute random features to approximate three types of kernels, Gaussian, Laplacian and Cauchy. We compared their performance using an SVM in the context of the DCASE Task 1 - Acoustic Scene Classification. Experiments show that both, input and random features outperformed the DCASE baseline by an absolute 4%. Moreover, the random features reduced the dimensionality of the input by more than three times with minimal loss of performance and by more than six times and still outperformed the baseline. Hence, random features could be employed by state of the art approaches to compute low-storage features and perform faster kernel computations.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1801.02690", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2782919737", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["659648", "10988833", "12506569", "4971175", "6590871", "11041828", "10769575", "2915490", "877929", "53007193", "11081749", "1440386", "17377212", "8726667"], "inbound_citations": ["52288148", "52405302", "198119217"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21446171"}

This work describes an iterative algorithm for estimating optimal viewpoints, so called next-best-views (NBVs). The goal is to incrementally construct a topological network from the scene during the consecutive acquisition of several views. Our approach is a hybrid method between a surface-based and a volumetric approach with a continuous model space. Hence, a new scan taken from an optimal position should either cover as much as possible from the unknown object surface in one single scan, or densify the existing data and close possible gaps. Based on the point density, we recover the essential and structural information of a scene based on the Growing Neural Gas (GNG) algorithm. From the created graph representation of topological relations, the density of the point cloud at each network node is estimated by approximating the volume of Voronoi cells. The NBV Finder selects a network node as NBV, which has the lowest point density. Our NBV method is self-terminating when all regions reach a predefined minimum point density or the change of the GNG error is zero. For evaluation, we use a Buddha statue with a rather simple surface geometry but still some concave parts and the Stanford Dragon with a more complex object surface containing occluded and concave parts.

Although those approaches have been very successful, they require significant quantities of historical data, often over extended periods of time, to train machine learning models and achieve accurate predictions. New buildings and buildings with newly installed meters have small historical datasets that are insufficient to create accurate predictions. Transfer learning methods have been proposed as a way to use cross-domain datasets to improve predictions. However, these methods do not consider the effects of seasonality within domains. Consequently, this paper proposes Hephaestus, a novel transfer learning method for cross-building energy forecasting based on time series multi-feature regression with seasonal and trend adjustment. This method enables energy prediction with merged data from similar buildings with different distributions and different seasonal profiles. Thus, it improves energy prediction accuracy for a new building with limited data by using datasets from other similar buildings.

However, toxicological testing, either in vitro or in vivo, is time-consuming, labour intensive and expensive. An alternative to the classic experiments is the use of computational (in silico) approaches, such as machine learning. For machine learning, it is assumed that substances with comparable structure or molecular features also exhibit the comparable pharmacological or toxicological action. Based on the comparison of substances with known pharmacological or toxicological action to substances with unknown properties, models, which were generated using machine learning methods, are able to predict the action of the latter substances. ::: The aim of this work was the development of predictive machine learning models for the estimation of risk of hepatotoxicity and genotoxicity. These models were then applied on two different substance groups and the outcome was compared to available literature data. ::: The acute hepatotoxic potential of over 600 different pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) was evaluated using the methods Random Forest and artificial Neural Networks. The predicted qualitative hepatotoxicity of both models was highly correlated. Furthermore, specific structural motives showed different hepatotoxic potential. Overall, the obtained results fitted well with already published in vitro and in vivo data on the acute hepatotoxic properties of PAs. ::: The genotoxic/ mutagenic potential of PAs was addressed using six different machine learning methods (LAZAR (Lazy Structure-Activity Relationships), Support Vector Machines, Random Forest and two Deep Learning Networks). Even though the models achieved only low to moderate accuracy rates, the best model clearly showed structural specific differences in the predicted genotoxic potential. ::: Furthermore, the acute hepatotoxic potential of 165 protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs) was predicted using Random Forest and artificial Neural Networks. The models confirmed clinical observations that PKIs have in general a high probability for inducing hepatotoxicity. However, interestingly, there seemed to be a target specific difference, with inhibitors of Janus kinases having the lowest hepatotoxic probability of 60-67%. ::: The greatest challenge is the performance of the models. This has to be validated e.g. by cross-validation before the model can be used on the substances of interest.

In this paper, the proposed tracking method adopts the classification posterior probability of Support Vector Machine (SVM) to relate the observation likelihood of particle filter for efficient tracking. However, previous works only employ the final output label of SVM for classification. Due to no existing TCO vision dataset available in public, we establish a dataset including TCO videos and extracted human samples to train the classifier and test the proposed tracking method. Moreover, we adjust tracking window distribution of particle filter to fit the characteristic of catadioptric omnidirectional vision which is the size of target in omni-image depends on the distance between target image and the center of catadioptric omnidirectional image.

In this paper, we present an efficient yet practical system, IMOD, to incrementally train an existing object detection model such that it can detect new object classes without losing its capability to detect old classes. The key component of IMOD is a novel incremental learning algorithm that trains end-to-end for one-stage object detection deep models only using training data of new object classes. Specifically, to avoid catastrophic forgetting, the algorithm distills three types of knowledge from the old model to mimic the old model's behavior on object classification, bounding box regression and feature extraction. In addition, since the training data for the new classes may not be available, a real-time dataset construction pipeline is designed to collect training images on-the-fly and automatically label the images with both category and bounding box annotations. We have implemented IMOD under both mobile-cloud and mobile-only setups.

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides information on crop types for US cropland as a Cropland Data Layer (CDL). However, CDL is only available at the end of the year after the crop growing season. Therefore, CDL is unable to support in-season research and decision-making regarding crop loss estimation, yield estimation, and grain pricing. The USDA mostly relies on field survey and farmers\u2019 reports for the ground truth to train image classification models, which is one of the major reasons for the delayed release of CDL. This research aims to use trusted pixels as ground truth to train classification models. Trusted pixels are pixels which follow a specific crop rotation pattern. These trusted pixels are used to train image classification models for the classification of in-season Landsat images to identify major crop types. Six different classification algorithms are investigated and tested to select the best algorithm for this study. The Random Forest algorithm stands out among selected algorithms. This study classified Landsat scenes between May and mid-August for Iowa. The overall agreements of classification results with CDL in 2017 are 84%, 94%, and 96% for May, June, and July, respectively. The classification accuracies have been assessed through 683 ground truth data points collected from the fields. The overall accuracies of single date multi-band image classification are 84%, 89% and 92% for May, June, and July, respectively.

Nevertheless, some redundant and irrelevant features in monitoring data are usually not conducive to identify fault state but significantly reduce the correct rate of diagnosis and increase the computational complexity and memory storage space. The existing filter feature selection approaches usually need to provide the number of selected features in advance, which brings an extra burden to decision makers. To make up for this deficiency, this paper proposes a feature selection method based on fuzzy Bayes risk (FBR) to generate an optimal feature subset automatically without having to preset the feature number. A heuristic forward greedy feature selection algorithm based on the proposed fuzzy Bayes risk theory is designed. Subsequently, a data-driven fault diagnosis strategy is designed by employing FBR and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Finally, numerical experiments on UCI data and the fault diagnoses of satellite power system are carried out to illustrate the superiority and applicability of the proposed method.

The magnitude of the disease remains unknown. In fact, it is a significant health problem in many other developing countries.

Classification is a machine learning technique used to predict the correlation between data samples and classes. There are several classification techniques, among which are: Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) and Naive Bayes (NB) Classifier. Feature Selection for the classification of cancer data means discovering feature values and profiles of diseased and healthy samples. It also means using this knowledge to predict the state of new samples. In this paper, we have proposed an approach for feature selection based on using SVM in three different ways. First, using SVM as a classifier to build a model based on the training data. The purpose is to measure the accuracy of the model in predicting the category of the test data compared with other classifiers. Second, using SVM as a learner, where data is clustered via K-Means into 3, 4 and 5 clusters. Different classifiers are then applied to the clustered data such as SVM, K-NN and NB. A number of 2 validation methods are used to help predict the accuracy of each classifier. These methods are: the 10-Fold Cross Validation (CV) and the Leave-One-Out. Third, using SVM for feature weighting, by predicting feature importance relative to a target class.

Gene expression profiling has identified a number of breast cancer signatures that are useful for prognostic and therapeutic strategies. The dimension and complexity of genomic data demand advanced predictive models that can distinguish subtle phenotypes. We have developed tools that can generate thousands of potential gene expression signatures that have very good performance in retrospective subtyping of breast cancer samples, many of which are likely to suffer from misclassifications in independent validation data. We therefore attempted to use additional modalities to further characterize these signatures in order to filter out the spurious ones. Previously, we were successful in using clinical prognostic indices (Nottingham Prognostic Index, St. Gallen, and NCI) to improve gene expression signature discovery. In this work, we investigated the use of DNA methylation information with gene expression to improve gene expression signature discovery and refine breast cancer subtyping. Immuno-histological-based subtypes of luminal or basal were assigned to 104 breast cancer samples for which gene expression data was publicly available. Additionally, we obtained DNA methylation profiles for 60 of the samples using an advanced DNA methylation (MOMA) technology. These samples were clustered into the two subtypes based on their methylation profiles. We use a Genetic Algorithm-based feature selection method for Support Vector Machine classification (GA-SVM) to identify gene expression signatures. To assess the reproducibility of the signatures, we repeat our analysis over 100 independent trials, randomly selecting samples for signature discovery and validation. In the first leg of our study, we identified gene expression signatures using only the gene expression data to guide the discovery process. This was then compared with the second leg of our study, where the discovery of gene expression signatures was aided by the methylation subtyping. Here the subtyping performance of a gene expression signature was evaluated both with respect to the immuno-histological subtypes and the methylation-based subtyping.

Direct measurement of individual CH4 emissions is logistically demanding and expensive, and correlated traits (proxies) or models can be used instead as a means to predict emissions. However, most predictive models tend to be specific and are valid mainly within the circumstances under which they were developed. Robust prediction models that work across countries and production environments may be built by combining heterogeneous data from several sources. However, combining heterogeneous individual animal observations on CH4 proxies from several sources is challenging and reports are scant in literature. The main objective of this study was to combine heterogeneous individual animal observations on CH4 proxies to develop robust enteric CH4 prediction models. Data on dairy cattle CH4 emissions and related proxies from 16 herds were made available by 13 research centers across 9 European countries within the Methagene EU COST Action FA1302 consortium on \u201cLarge-scale methane measurements on individual ruminants for genetic evaluations\u201d. After a through edition and harmonization, the final dataset comprised 48,804 observations from 2,391 cows. Random Forest (RF) models were used to predict CH4 emissions and to estimate the relative importance of proxies for across-country predictions. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to detect potential data stratifications. Milk yield, milk fat, DIM, BW, herd and country of origin appeared to be the most relevant proxies in the prediction model. An overall prediction accuracy of 0.81 was estimated from the combined heterogeneous data. This study is a first attempt to develop methods and approaches to combine heterogeneous individual animal data on proxies for CH4 to build robust models for prediction of CH4 emissions across diverse production systems and environments. The methodology outlined here can be extended to combining heterogeneous data, pedigree information and genome-wide dense marker information for estimation of genetic parameters and prediction of breeding values for traits related to dairy system CH4 emissions.

Evidently, even modest reductions in hospital care costs matter. A 2009 study showed that nearly $30.8 billion in hospital care cost during 2006 was potentially preventable, with heart diseases being responsible for about 31% of that amount. Methods Our goal is to accurately and efficiently predict heart-related hospitalizations based on the available patient-specific medical history. To the best of our knowledge, the approaches we introduce are novel for this problem. The prediction of hospitalization is formulated as a supervised classification problem. We use de-identified Electronic Health Record ( EHR ) data from a large urban hospital in Boston to identify patients with heart diseases. Patients are labeled and randomly partitioned into a training and a test set. We apply five machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM), AdaBoost using trees as the weak learner, logistic regression, a naive Bayes event classifier, and a variation of a Likelihood Ratio Test adapted to the specific problem. Each model is trained on the training set and then tested on the test set. Results All five models show consistent results, which could, to some extent, indicate the limit of the achievable prediction accuracy. Our results show that with under 30% false alarm rate, the detection rate could be as high as 82%.

In the last few years, Machine learning classification techniques have been emerging for crop classification. Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a platform to explore the multiple satellite data with different advanced classification techniques without even downloading the satellite data. The main objective of this study is to explore the ability of different machine learning classification techniques like, Random Forest (RF), Classification And Regression Trees (CART) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for crop classification. High Resolution optical data, Sentinel-2, MSI (10 m) was used for crop classification in the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) farm for the Rabi season 2016 for major crops. Around 100 crop fields (~400 Hectare) in IARI were analysed. Smart phone-based ground truth data were collected. The best cloud free image of Sentinel 2 MSI data (5 Feb 2016) was used for classification using automatic filtering by percentage cloud cover property using the GEE. Polygons as feature space was used as training data sets based on the ground truth data for crop classification using machine learning techniques. Post classification, accuracy assessment analysis was done through the generation of the confusion matrix (producer and user accuracy), kappa coefficient and F value. In this study it was found that using GEE through cloud platform, satellite data accessing, filtering and pre-processing of satellite data could be done very efficiently. In terms of overall classification accuracy and kappa coefficient, Random Forest (93.3%, 0.9178) and CART (73.4%, 0.6755) classifiers performed better than SVM (74.3%, 0.6867) classifier.

However, in order to achieve good results in a new domain, it is generally demanded to fine-tune a pre-trained deep architecture using new labeled data coming from the target application domain. The fine-tuning procedure is also required when the domain application settings change, e. g., when a camera is moved, or a new camera is installed. This implies the collection and pixel-wise la-beling of images to be used for training, which slows down the deployment of semantic segmentation systems in real industrial scenarios and increases the industrial costs. Taking into account the aforementioned issues, in this paper we propose an approach based on Adversarial Learning to perform scene adaptation for semantic segmentation. We frame scene adaptation as the task of predicting semantic segmentation masks for images belonging to a Target Scene Context given labeled images coming from a Source Scene Context and unlabeled images coming from the Target Scene Context.

However, a major limitation of GANs is that training relies on passing gradients from the discriminator through the generator via back-propagation. This makes it fundamentally difficult to train GANs with discrete data, as generation in this case typically involves a non-differentiable function. These difficulties extend to the reinforcement learning setting when the action space is composed of discrete decisions. We address these issues by reframing the GAN framework so that the generator is no longer trained using gradients through the discriminator, but is instead trained using a learned critic in the actor-critic framework with a Temporal Difference (TD) objective.

Our approach is to realize the deletion by incremental learning without destroying the previously trained network but by incorporating some new hidden units so as to inhibit all the actual outputs for the trained patterns to be deleted. Fahlman-Lebiere (FL) learning algorithm is particularly suitable for this purpose since this algorithm can gradually add the required number of new hidden units. Previous studies show that the addition of categories and patterns can be performed by incremental learning [9], [10]. In this paper, we apply FL algorithm to the deletion of some of the trained patterns by incremental learning. Investigation shows that FL network realizing this deletion task has better generalization ability than Backpropagation (BP) network due to the attainment of well-saturated hidden outputs in FL network.

It can be graded into five levels of severity according to international protocol. However, optimizing a grading model to have strong generalizability requires a large amount of balanced training data, which is difficult to collect particularly for the high severity levels. Typical data augmentation methods, including random flipping and rotation, cannot generate data with high diversity. In this paper, we propose a diabetic retinopathy generative adversarial network (DR-GAN) to synthesize high-resolution fundus images which can be manipulated with arbitrary grading and lesion information. Thus, large-scale generated data can be used for more meaningful augmentation to train a DR grading and lesion segmentation model. The proposed retina generator is conditioned on the structural and lesion masks, as well as adaptive grading vectors sampled from the latent grading space, which can be adopted to control the synthesized grading severity. Moreover, a multi-scale spatial and channel attention module is devised to improve the generation ability to synthesize details. Multi-scale discriminators are designed to operate from large to small receptive fields, and joint adversarial losses are adopted to optimize the whole network in an end-to-end manner. With extensive experiments evaluated on the EyePACS dataset connected to Kaggle, as well as our private dataset (SKA - will be released once get official permission), we validate the effectiveness of our method, which can both synthesize highly realistic (1280 x 1280) controllable fundus images and contribute to the DR grading task.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1912.04670", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2998240002", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["26657811", "55213000", "186718", "4438983", "26747365", "52274689", "195441638", "206594692", "52177403", "8574504", "52305483", "1033682", "11758569", "12803511", "206770979", "52889459", "204028322", "52289143", "16628328", "52272195", "49215665", "5076744", "2298645", "51628313", "54447649", "41805341", "52180375", "3719281", "2607360", "54217124", "1687220", "47252984", "211022860", "6576859", "6789015", "326772", "50784066"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:209140699"}

The texturing of height maps is usually performed as a post-processing step - with software requiring access to the height and gradient of the terrain in order to generate a set of conditions for colouring slopes, flats, mountains etc. With further additions such as biomes specifying which predominant texturing the region should exhibit such as grass, snow, dirt etc. much like the real-world. These methods combined with a height map generation algorithm can create impressive terrain renders which look visually stunning - however can appear somewhat repetitive. Previous work has explored the use of variants of Generative Adversarial Networks for the learning of elevation data through real-world data sets of world height data. In this paper, a method is proposed for learning not only the height map values but also the corresponding satellite image of a specific region. This data is trained through a non-spatially dependant generative adversarial network, which can produce an endless amount of variants of a specific region. The textured outputs are measured using existing similarity metrics and compared to the original region, which yields strong results. Additionally, a visual and statistical comparison of other deep learning image synthesis techniques is performed. The network outputs are also rendered in a 3D graphics engine and visualised in the paper. This method produces powerful outputs when compared directly with the training region, creating a tool that can produce many different variants of the target terrain.

Extracting discriminative representations of images is the real crux of this task. Directly utilizing the results of fully connected layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is one of the best feature extraction methods. However, the fully connected layer is only supervised by the softmax loss, which only aims to maximize the accuracy of object classification and hardly pays attention to the spatial distribution of features, especially the intra-class and inter-class feature distances which are of great importance in semantic-based image retrieval. To compensate the performance degradation due to this reason, we try to address the spatial distribution of the features by two different loss functions. The first loss function jointly combines the softmax loss and the center loss in the training of the CNNs, which simultaneously ensures that the features of images with different contents are separable and the features of images in the same class are close. The second loss function is defined as an improved center loss which not only penalizes the distance between the obtained deep feature and the feature center of its own class, but also encourages a far distance between the feature and the feature centers of any other classes.

Where image availability was sub-optimal, we tested whether winter images help to improve classification accuracy. Our approach yielded accurate mono-temporal maps (on average > 95% overall accuracy), and change maps (on average 93.5%). The additional use of winter imagery improved classification accuracy by about 2%. Our results suggest that Russia's temperate forests underwent substantial changes during the observed period. Overall, forested areas increased by 4.5%, but the changes in forested area varied over time: a decline in forest area between 1990 and 1995 (\u2212 1%) was followed by an increase in overall forest area in recent years (+1.4%, 2005\u20132010), possibly caused in part by forest regrowth on abandoned farmlands. Disturbances varied greatly among administrative regions, suggesting that differences in socioeconomic conditions strongly influence disturbance rates.

Here we propose to start exploring the space between local and global graph kernels, striking the balance between both worlds. Specifically, we introduce a novel graph kernel based on the $k$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm. Unfortunately, the $k$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm scales exponentially in $k$. Consequently, we devise a stochastic version of the kernel with provable approximation guarantees using conditional Rademacher averages. On bounded-degree graphs, it can even be computed in constant time.

In particular, DeepGL begins by deriving a set of base features from the graph (e.g., graphlet features) and automatically learns a multi-layered hierarchical graph representation where each successive layer leverages the output from the previous layer to learn features of a higher-order. Contrary to previous work, DeepGL learns relational functions (each representing a feature) that naturally generalize across-networks and are therefore useful for graph-based transfer learning tasks. Moreover, DeepGL naturally supports attributed graphs, learns interpretable inductive graph representations, and is space-efficient (by learning sparse feature vectors). In addition, DeepGL is expressive, flexible with many interchangeable components, efficient with a time complexity of O(|E|), and scalable for large networks via an efficient parallel implementation. Compared with recent methods, DeepGL is (1) effective for across-network transfer learning tasks and large (attributed) graphs, (2) space-efficient requiring up to 6x less memory, (3) fast with up to 182x speedup in runtime performance, and (4) accurate with an average improvement in AUC of 20% or more on many learning tasks and across a wide variety of networks.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3184558.3191524", "venue": "WWW", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2798932700", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11482293", "13451392", "64898962", "10574408", "5865347", "1044293", "13622087", "16689401", "322265", "207238980", "13675759", "3144218", "7036086", "3074096", "5959482", "16447573", "4990281", "1430801", "3051291", "4783118", "2980810", "10141934", "15380232", "12469192", "34526687", "206756462", "8399404", "9237797", "207238964", "31062300", "2196507"], "inbound_citations": ["207756958", "52281196", "195316438", "118686695", "202640791", "199373362", "72940825", "52941263", "210929990", "213010956", "49903351", "53219978", "53691235", "52054915", "53286643", "118721501", "120397368", "120397368", "201625275", "212647862", "198954004"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13786164"}

The emergence of inexpensive 2.5D depth cameras has enabled the extraction of the articulated human body pose. However, human hand skeleton extraction still stays as a challenging problem since the hand contains as many joints as the human body model. The small size of the hand also makes the problem more challenging due to resolution limits of the depth cameras. Moreover, hand poses suffer from self-occlusion which is considerably less likely in a body pose. This paper describes a scheme for extracting the hand skeleton using random regression forests in real-time that is robust to self- occlusion and low resolution of the depth camera. In addition to that, the proposed algorithm can estimate the joint positions even if all of the pixels related to a joint are out of the camera frame. The performance of the new method is compared to the random classification forests based method in the literature. Moreover, the performance of the joint estimation is further improved using a novel hierarchical mode selection algorithm that makes use of constraints imposed by the skeleton geometry. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on datasets containing synthetic and real data, where self-occlusion is frequently encountered.

This study develops a new framework for computer-aided detection of pulmonary nodules thorough a fully-automatic analysis of Computed Tomography (CT) images. In the present work, the multi-layer CT data is fed into a pre-processing step that exploits an adaptive diffusion-based smoothing algorithm in which the parameters are automatically tuned using an adaptation technique. After multiple levels of morphological filtering, the Regions of Interest (ROIs) are extracted from the smoothed images. The Statistical Region Merging (SRM) algorithm is applied to the ROIs in order to segment each layer of the CT data. Extracted segments in consecutive layers are then analyzed in such a way that if they intersect at more than a predefined number of pixels, they are labeled with a similar index. The boundaries of the segments in adjacent layers which have the same indices are then connected together to form three-dimensional objects as the nodule candidates.

Tumour exists as a mass in the brain. Hence detection of the tumour is more important before providing the respective treatment. This paper deals with improved system for brain tumour detection and classification. Medical imaging is an essential phase in the detection of malignancy within the human body. In case of cancer, imaging becomes inevitable as the mode of treatment itself relies on nature of the tumour. The fundamental modalities employed in clinic includes the Computed Tomography (CT), Ultrasound, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). In CT scan images due to poor soft tissue contrast, extraction of the tumour segment becomes difficult and it is also challenging to detect lesions. As with ultrasound it cannot be used for detection of cancer and lacks accuracy. Hence MRI images are taken into consideration which overcomes these limitations and allows functional imaging. By using MRI, cancer staging can also be determined. An MRI image of the brain tumour is taken as the input which is segmented and classified sequentially. Each step employs well defined algorithms paving its way to provide accurate results even for haphazard MRI images. It bates the problem of analysing the poor quality MRI images. Segmentation method using adaptive k-means clustering divides the MRI image into multiple segments from which a meaningful extract of the brain tumour is obtained. Finally, the segmented image is classified using Support Vector Machine classifier. This classifier determines the type of the tumour.

Face image reading for age estimation is an intuitive way after classifying face images into several predefined age groups. Age estimation can be regarded as a multiclass problem due to the variation of given individuals determined by genes and several external factors. There are various applications from age estimation, such as forensic and image detection. To approximate and detect the age of each person, the implementation of age estimation algorithm is essential. Many proposed algorithms contain several methods to build the whole mechanism. However, the implementation of SVM combined with optimization is not explored yet. Using an optimization algorithm supposedly can improve accuracy of age estimation algorithm. Based on that fact, we apply GA and PSO for this goal due to their simplicity and powerful ability. GA and PSO are used for this study to make the comparison between both optimizations. This work derives the results for both with optimization and without optimization to prove whether the approach has been successfully realized or not. In the proposed scheme, we conducted age range estimation with five predefined classes and combined several techniques of extracting estimation information from image data, such as Local Gabor Binary Patterns (LGBP) for filtering, Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for feature extraction, Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification, as well as Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for optimization. Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization were used to find the most suitable parameters to carry out the SVM method. Experimental results show that our proposed hybrid method can raise the estimation accuracy compared to other schemes.

The class of intense MCs, called polar lows, are accompanied by extremely strong surface winds and heat fluxes and thus largely influencing deep ocean water formation in the polar regions. Accurate detection of polar mesocyclones in high-resolution satellite data, while challenging, is a time-consuming task, when performed manually. Existing algorithms for the automatic detection of polar mesocyclones are based on the conventional analysis of patterns of cloudiness and they involve different empirically defined thresholds of geophysical variables. As a result, various detection methods typically reveal very different results when applied to a single dataset. We develop a conceptually novel approach for the detection of MCs based on the use of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). As a first step, we demonstrate that DCNN model is capable of performing binary classification of 500 \u00d7 500 km patches of satellite images regarding MC patterns presence in it. The training dataset is based on the reference database of MCs manually tracked in the Southern Hemisphere from satellite mosaics. We use a subset of this database with MC diameters falling in the range of 200\u2013400 km. This dataset is further used for testing several different DCNN setups, specifically, DCNN built \u201cfrom scratch\u201d, DCNN based on VGG16 pre-trained weights also engaging the Transfer Learning technique, and DCNN based on VGG16 with Fine Tuning technique. Each of these networks is further applied to both infrared (IR) and a combination of infrared and water vapor (IR + WV) satellite imagery. The best skills (97% in terms of the binary classification accuracy score) is achieved with the model that averages the estimates of the ensemble of different DCNNs.

In this paper, we consider how to leverage the virtually ubiquitous USB interface to uniquely identify computers based on the characteristics of their hardware, firmware, and software stacks. We collect USB data on a corpus of over 250 machines with a variety of hardware and software configurations, and through machine learning classification techniques we demonstrate that, given a period of observation on the order of tenths of a second, we can differentiate hosts based on a variety of attributes such as operating system, manufacturer, and model with upwards of 90% accuracy. Over longer periods of observation on the order of minutes, we demonstrate the ability to distinguish between hosts that are seemingly identical; using Random Forest classification and statistical analysis, we generate fingerprints that can be used to uniquely and consistently identify 70% of a field of 30 machines that share identical OS and hardware specifications. Additionally, we show that we can detect the presence of a hypervisor on a computer with 100% accuracy and that our results are resistant to concept drift, a spoofing attack in which malicious hosts provide fraudulent USB messages, and relaying of commands from other machines.

Despite an assumption that face verification systems based on fisherface is thought to be more accurate than eigenface system, recent studies reveal that the idea is not always true. In this research, in order to leverage on the strength of both eigenface and fisherface techniques, a fusion of these two techniques by using different fusion method is examined. Four fusion methods, namely, sum-rule, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Linear Support Vector Machines (Linear SVM), and Gaussian Support Vector Machines (Gaussian SVM) are considered.

For dealing with the problem that genetic algorithm are hardly applied to community detection, we propose a genetic algorithm with ensemble learning (GAEL) for detecting community structure in complex networks. GAEL replaces its traditional crossover operator with a multi-individual crossover operator based on ensemble learning. Therefore, GAEL can avoid the problems that are brought by traditional crossover operator which is only able to mix string blocks of different individuals, but not able to recombine clustering contexts of different individuals into new better ones. In addition, the local search strategy, which makes mutated node be placed into the community where most of its neighbors are, is used in mutation operator. At last, a Markov random walk based method is used to initialize population in this paper, and it can provide us a population of accurate and diverse clustering solutions. Those diverse and accurate individuals are suitable for ensemble learning based multi-individual crossover operator.

Many existing models address this problem by positing a hierarchy of processing units, mirroring the roughly hierarchical structure of naturalistic tasks themselves. Although intuitive, such an approach has led to a number of difculties, including a reliance on overly rigid sequencing mechanisms and a limited ability to address both learning and context sensitivity in behavior. We consider here an alternative framework in which the representation of temporal context depends on learned, recurrent connections within a network that maps from environmental inputs to actions. Applying this approach to the specic, and in many ways prototypical, everyday task of coffee-making, we examine its ability to account for several central characteristics of normal and impaired human performance. The model learns to deal e xibly with a complex set of sequencing constraints, encoding contextual information at multiple time-scales within a single, distributed internal representation. Mildly degrading this context representation leads to errors resembling the everyday islips of actioni that normal individuals commit under distraction. More severe degradation leads to a pattern of disorganization resembling that observed in action disorganization syndrome, a variety of apraxia. Analysis of the model\u2019s function yields novel, testable predictions relevant to both normal and apraxic performance.

In detail, the neighboring joint density features of the DCT coefficients are extracted; then Support Vector Machines (SVM) are applied to the features for detection. To improve the evaluation of JPEG resized detection, we utilize the shape parameter of generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) of DCT coefficients to measure the image complexity. The study shows that our method is highly effective in detecting JPEG images resizing and splicing forgery.

The essential contribution of this work is the realization of the transfer learning scheme that can extract shared intrinsic representations from the same type of objects in different domains; so that given a few samples, the classifier trained in the source domain can be directly applied to the target domain without having to collect more ground truth labels from the target domain.

In this thesis we study the problem of visual image and video understanding and specifically, we address the problem via designing and implementing novel multi-modal and structured representation learning approaches, both of which are fundamental research hot-spots in machine learning. Multi-modal representation learning involves relating information from multiple input sources, and the structured representation learning works on exploring rich structural information hidden in the data for robust feature learning.

In essence, the multilabel learning aims at learning a predictive function from feature space to a label space. The predictive function learning procedure can be regarded as a feature selection procedure and as a classifier construction procedure. For feature selection, we extract features for each label based on the learned positive and negative feature-label correlations. The positive and negative relationships can illustrate which labels can and cannot be well presented by the corresponding features, respectively, due to the semantic gap. For classifier construction, we perform sample-specific and label-specific classifications. The interlabel and interinstance correlations are combined in these two kinds of classifications. These two correlations are learned from both input features and output labels when the output labels are too sparse to reveal the informative correlation. However, there exists the semantic gap when combining input and output spaces to mine the labelwise relationship. The semantic gap can be bridged by the learned feature-label correlation.

Active learning (AL) is a way to deal with the above problem by asking for the labels of the most \u201cinformative\u201d data points. To reduce the amount of human labeling effort while maintaining the SVMs performance, in this work we propose an uncertainty sampling-based active learning approach for SVMs to annotate the most uncertain unlabeled instances, i.e., an algorithm to select the most informative instances for SVMs learning process. During the SVMs active learning process, to reduce annotation effort while maintaining the SVMs classification performance, we firstly employ the decision margin of SVMs output as the initial uncertainty measure to select the most uncertain instances, to further reduce the number of unlabeled instances to be annotated, we employ the Ratio of Center-Distance to select the boundary vectors of SVMs. We provide a theoretical motivation for the algorithm.

Drywalls are a very particular case of detectable objects, because the walls\u2019 extents mostly do not fit in the sensor of the camera system.

Hence, three different states, namely the installation of panels, plastering and painting are analyzed.

This adversarial nature makes security applications different from the classical machine learning problems; for instance, an adversary (attacker) might change the distribution of test data and violate the data stationarity, a common assumption in machine learning techniques. Since machine learning methods are not inherently adversary-aware, a classifier designer should investigate the robustness of a learning system under attack. In this respect, recent studies have modeled the identified attacks against machine learning-based detection systems. Based on this, a classifier designer can evaluate the performance of a learning system leveraging the modeled attacks. Prior research explored a gradient-based approach in order to devise an attack against a classifier with differentiable discriminant function like SVM. However, there are several powerful classifiers with non-differentiable decision boundary such as Random Forest, which are commonly used in different security domain and applications. In this paper, we present a novel approach to model an attack against classifiers with non-differentiable decision boundary. In the experimentation, we first present an example that visually shows the effect of a successful attack on the MNIST handwritten digits classification task. Then we conduct experiments for two well-known applications in the security domain: spam filtering and malware detection in PDF files.

In this paper, we seek to leverage labeled data from multiple source domains to enhance classification performance in a target domain where the target data are received in an online fashion. This problem is known as the online transfer learning problem. To achieve this, we propose novel online transfer learning paradigms in which the source and target domains are leveraged adaptively.

The classifier is first trained on software history, and then used to predict if an impending change causes a bug. Drawbacks of existing classifier-based bug prediction techniques are insufficient performance for practical use and slow prediction times due to a large number of machine learned features. This paper investigates multiple feature selection techniques that are generally applicable to classification-based bug prediction methods. The techniques discard less important features until optimal classification performance is reached. The total number of features used for training is substantially reduced, often to less than 10 percent of the original. The performance of Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers when using this technique is characterized on 11 software projects. Naive Bayes using feature selection provides significant improvement in buggy F-measure (21 percent improvement) over prior change classification bug prediction results (by the second and fourth authors [28]). The SVM's improvement in buggy F-measure is 9 percent. Interestingly, an analysis of performance for varying numbers of features shows that strong performance is achieved at even 1 percent of the original number of features.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TSE.2012.43", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2050496630", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["18683182", "53248664", "16296713", "7433897", "250721", "121988657", "2613001", "2165520", "7953114", "198120286", "14691851", "3116168", "6073636", "14639907", "4467142", "15047616", "14656471", "2427083", "5155714", "11960780", "21256056", "14525572", "206854545", "47388286", "8190856", "207587242", "13295968", "32800624", "60567601", "9725955", "209842899", "7311285", "36601646", "1957065", "10267782", "41284969", "16074379", "16068943", "6117989", "18493939", "17334513", "2401607", "5832984", "206778457", "14590852", "1304328"], "inbound_citations": ["2017285", "6138799", "201620614", "96432888", "18505688", "122358226", "52303757", "13774939", "52846798", "4845691", "14609370", "53348943", "209179056", "4602280", "43721704", "23759448", "1092950", "52194924", "53486190", "118682217", "202155492", "84187345", "10991699", "49648152", "10873796", "1918895", "55357917", "14468574", "44144537", "6311268", "12010395", "199501712", "53296687", "125165001", "52301512", "201889732", "199571796", "10792564", "3249996", "14448790", "16175213", "211207773", "69959759", "17280484", "4634301", "1675102", "14171646", "13693392", "28254601", "49339269", "22125228", "53524221", "58954351", "53286665", "8174905", "10429378", "51815932", "64889100", "203640764", "57362999", "1918395", "17002372", "23860279", "53413164", "10092092", "49668071", "198929906", "25358894", "11067362", "47020167", "30539450", "4614056", "3761015", "53410564", "52901808", "204745532", "31801173", "50774788", "44214787", "291524", "202146519", "204769297", "14494991", "43790479", "6949873", "44174999", "54745419", "28169454", "49430693", "12332144", "174800771", "14598139", "174800610", "6494803", "29877636", "12141772", "2503162", "10243866", "21740449", "214685908", "64651553", "46981568"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6139109"}

We first evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classifiers. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on four texture and five object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest.

This allows industrial users to increase efficiency and manageability while reducing cost and effort. Furthermore, the fourth industrial revolution, creating the so-called Industry 4.0, opens a variety of novel use and business cases in the industrial environment. However, this progress comes at the cost of an enlarged attack surface of industrial companies. Operational networks that have previously been phyiscally separated from public networks are now connected in order to make use of new communication capabilites. This motivates the need for industrial intrusion detection solutions that are compatible to the long-term operation machines in industry as well as the heterogeneous and fast-changing networks. In this work, process data is analysed. The data is created and monitored on real-world hardware. After a set up phase, attacks are introduced into the systems that influence the process behaviour. A time series-based anomaly detection approach, the Matrix Profiles, are adapted to the specific needs and applied to the intrusion detection. The results indicate an applicability of these methods to detect attacks in the process behaviour. Furthermore, they are easily integrated into existing process environments. Additionally, one-class classifiers One-Class Support Vector Machines and Isolation Forest are applied to the data without a notion of timing.

Following this methodology, we also propose a new feature selection algorithm, namely Pavicd (Probabilistic Attribute-Value for Class Distinction). Experiments in fourteen microarray cancer datasets reveal that Pavicd obtains the best performance in terms of running time and classification accuracy when using Ripper-k and C4.5 as classifiers.

Finally, the final haze-free image was obtained according to the degradation model. Experimental results show that the method has obvious advantages in its detail recovery and color retention. In addition, it effectively improves the quality of sensor images.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC6111301", "pubmed_id": "30096891", "doi": "10.3390/s18082606", "venue": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "journal": "Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2885674904", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["45152878", "127916157", "13219269", "206764748", "2700315", "4331715", "18774783", "14684722", "36985105", "130994", "63220496", "2429897", "14092238", "19248960", "17763780", "15385066", "6966375", "18711209", "14391271"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:51956866"}

Therefore, an Intrusion detection system (IDS) is a secure mechanism, which is aimed to identify and prevent from unapproved access, as it maintains harmless and protects network systems. Keeping these limitations, we present an approach called DBDNN, which combines Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCANSC) and the deep neural network (DNN). First, \u201csplit the given dataset into subsets depend on similarity features by core point\u201d, as in DBSCANSC. Secondly, \u201cthe distance between data points in training dataset and testing dataset calculated by using closely reachable points and which is fed input to deep neural network system\u201d. This study used KDD-Cupp99 datasets to check the implementation of the model. The experimental results indicate that the proposed DBSCANSC-DNN performs higher than Bayesian classifier (Bayes), Backpropagation Neural Networks (BPNN), Spectral Clustering and Deep Neural Networks (SCDNN) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM).

It has the goal of locating and removing a fault after a failure occurred during test. However, it is not a trivial task and generally consumes effort and time. Debugging techniques generally use testing information but usually they are very specific for certain domains, languages and development paradigms. Because of this, a Neural Network (NN) approach has been investigated with this goal. It is independent of the context and presented promising results for procedural code. However it was not validated in the context of Object-Oriented (OO) applications. In addition to this, the use of other Machine Learning techniques is also interesting, because they can be more efficient. With this in mind, the present work adapts the NN approach to the OO context and also explores the use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Results from the use of both techniques are presented and analysed. They show that their use contributes for easing the fault localization task.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/LATW.2009.4813783", "venue": "2009 10th Latin American Test Workshop", "journal": "2009 10th Latin American Test Workshop", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2124068357", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6934221", "13398381", "8001221", "152963", "18071800", "14073370", "62757144", "45892966", "16725931", "53876694", "11346789", "17046297", "60735092", "6039792", "109130516", "59823997", "18259651", "19697556", "29248733", "53662922", "61051762", "53224498", "3576620", "7135142", "10020696"], "inbound_citations": ["11402791", "53718120", "52902203", "6968664", "27882581", "7844555", "198147189", "906991", "44635638", "1708485", "5866699"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:31315609"}

Environmental models in forest areas have been benefited by the use of LiDAR-derived information in the last years. A multiple linear regression (MLR) with previous stepwise feature selection is the most common method in the literature to develop those models. MLR defines the relation between the set of field measurements and the statistics extracted from a LiDAR flight. Machine learning has emerged as a suitable tool to improve classic stepwise MLR results on LiDAR. Unfortunately, few studies have been proposed to compare the quality of the multiple machine learning approaches. This paper presents a comparison between the classic MLR-based methodology and regression techniques in machine learning (neural networks, support vector machines, nearest neighbour, ensembles such as random forests) with special emphasis on regression trees. The selected techniques are applied to real LiDAR data from two areas in the province of Lugo (Galizia, Spain).

Meanwhile agent-based systems provide frameworks to share knowledge from multiple agents in an open context. This thesis combines multi-agent knowledge sharing with ensemble methods to produce a new style of learning system for open environments. We now are surrounded by many smart objects such as wireless sensors, ambient communication devices, mobile medical devices and even information supplied via other humans. When we coordinate smart objects properly, we can produce a form of collective intelligence from their collaboration. Traditional ensemble methods and agent-based systems have complementary advantages and disadvantages in this context. Traditional ensemble methods show better classification performance, while agent-based systems might not guarantee their performance for classification. Traditional ensemble methods work as closed and centralised systems (so they cannot handle classifiers in an open context), while agent-based systems are natural vehicles for classifiers in an open context. We designed an open and social ensemble learning architecture, named J-model, to merge the conflicting benefits of the two research domains. The J-model architecture is based on a service choreography approach for coordinating classifiers. Coordination protocols are defined by interaction models that describe how classifiers will interact with one another in a peer-to-peer manner. The peer ranking algorithm recommends more appropriate classifiers to participate in an interaction model to boost the success rate of results of their interactions. Coordinated participant classifiers who are recommended by the peer ranking algorithm become an ensemble classifier within J-model. We evaluated J-model\u2019s classification performance with 13 UCI machine learning benchmark data sets and a virtual screening problem as a realistic classification problem. J-model showed better performance of accuracy, for 9 benchmark sets out of 13 data sets, than 8 other representative traditional ensemble methods.

We defined different interaction models for each specific classification task and the peer ranking algorithm was used across all the interaction models. Our research contributions to knowledge are as follows. First, we showed that service choreography can be an effective ensemble coordination method for classifiers in an open context. i Second, we used interaction models that implement task specific coordinations of classifiers to solve a variety of representative classification problems.

However, the sample usually has to be used throughout the synthesis stage. In contrast, the learned representation of the textures is more compact and discriminative, and can also yield good synthesis results. In this paper, we introduce a learned approach for texture synthesis based on support vector machines (SVM). This approach benefits from the merit of SVM that the sample texture pattern is learned using a model, and the sample itself can be discarded during the synthesis stage; the approach is also used to synthesize three-dimensional surface textures. Experimental results show that our approach is particularly effective in modeling and synthesizing near-regular or regular textures, which are difficult to achieve using traditional parametric texture synthesis methods.

{"paper_id": "125362804", "title": "Advances in nonnegative matrix factorization with application on data clustering", "authors": [{"first": "Jing", "middle": [], "last": "Wang", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Clustering is an important direction in many \ufb01elds, e.g., machine learning, data mining and computer vision. It aims to divide data into groups (clusters) for the purposes of summarization or improved understanding. With the rapid development of new technology, high-dimensional data become very common in many real world applications, such as satellite returned large number of images, robot received real-time video streaming, large-scale text database and the mass of information on the social networks (i.e., Facebook, twitter), etc, however, most existing clustering approaches are heavily restricted by the large number of features, and tend to be ine\ufb03cient and even infeasible. In this thesis, we focus on \ufb01nding an optimal low dimensional representation of high-dimensional data, based nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) framework, for better clustering. Speci\ufb01cally, there are three methods as follows: - Multiple Components Based Representation Learning Real data are usually complex and contain various components. For example, face images have expressions and genders. Each component mainly re\ufb02ects one aspect of data and provides information others do not have. Therefore, exploring the semantic information of multiple components as well as the diversity among them is of great bene\ufb01t to understand data comprehensively and in-depth. To this end, we propose a novel multi-component nonnegative matrix factorization. Instead of seeking for only one representation of data, our approach learns multiple representations simultaneously, with the help of the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) as a diversity term. HSIC explores the diverse information among the representations, where each representation corresponds to a component. By integrating the multiple representations, a more comprehensive representation is then established. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets have shown that MCNMF not only achieves more accurate performance over the state-of-the-arts using the aggregated representation, but also interprets data from di\ufb00erent aspects with the multiple representations, which is beyond what current NMFs can o\ufb00er. - Ordered Structure Preserving Representation Learning Real-world applications often process data, such as motion sequences and video clips, are with ordered structure, i.e., consecutive neighbouring data samples are very likely share similar features unless a sudden change occurs. Therefore, traditional NMF assumes the data samples and features to be independently distributed, making it not proper for the analysis of such data. To overcome this limitation, a novel NMF approach is proposed to take full advantage of the ordered nature embedded in the sequential data to improve the accuracy of data representation. With a L2,1-norm based neighbour penalty term, ORNMF enforces the similarity of neighbouring data. ORNMF also adopts the L2,1-norm based loss function to improve its robustness against noises and outliers. Moreover, ORNMF can \ufb01nd the cluster boundaries and get the number of clusters without the number of clusters to be given beforehand. A new iterative up- dating optimization algorithm is derived to solve ORNMF\u2019s objective function. The proofs of the convergence and correctness of the scheme are also presented. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets have demonstrated the e\ufb00ectiveness of ORNMF. - Diversity Enhanced Multi-view Representation Learning Multi-view learning aims to explore the correlations of di\ufb00erent information, such as di\ufb00erent features or modalities to boost the performance of data analysis. Multi-view data are very common in many real world applications because data is often collected from diverse domains or obtained from di\ufb00erent feature extractors. For example, color and texture information can be utilized as di\ufb00erent kinds of features in images and videos. Web pages are also able to be represented using the multi-view features based on text and hyperlinks. Taken alone, these views will often be de\ufb01cient or incomplete because di\ufb00erent views describe distinct perspectives of data. Therefore, we propose a Diverse Multi-view NMF approach to explore diverse information among multi-view representations for more comprehensive learning. With a novel diversity regularization term, DiNMF explicitly enforces the orthogonality of di\ufb00erent data representations. Importantly, DiNMF converges linearly and scales well with large-scale data. By taking into account the manifold structures, we further extend the approach under a graph-based model to preserve the locally geometrical structure of the manifolds for multi-view setting. Compared to other multi-view NMF methods, the enhanced diversity of both approaches reduce the redundancy between the multi-view representations, and improve the accuracy of the clustering results. - Constrained Multi-View Representation Learning To incorporate prior information for learning accurately, we propose a novel semi- supervised multi-view NMF approach, which considers both the label constraints as well as the multi-view consistence simultaneously. In particular, the approach guarantees that data sharing the same label will have the same new representation and be mapped into the same class in the low-dimensional space regardless whether they come from the same view. Moreover, di\ufb00erent from current NMF- based multi-view clustering methods that require the weight factor of each view to be speci\ufb01ed individually, we introduce a single parameter to control the distribution of weighting factors for NMF-based multi-view clustering. Consequently, the weight factor of each view can be assigned automatically depending on the dissimilarity between each new representation matrix and the consensus matrix. Besides, Using the structured sparsity-inducing, L2,1-norm, our method is robust against noises and hence can achieve more stable clustering results.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2810982894", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:125362804"}

Further, the non-stationary nature of EEG signals makes the task more difficult. Determination of epileptic focus is essential for the treatment of pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy. This requires accurate separation of focal and non-focal groups of EEG signals. Hence, an intelligent system that can detect and discriminate focal\u2013class (FC) and non\u2013focal\u2013class (NFC) of EEG signals automatically can aid the clinicians in their diagnosis. In order to facilitate accurate analysis of non-stationary signals, joint time\u2013frequency localized bases are highly desirable. The performance of wavelet bases is found to be effective in analyzing transient and abrupt behavior of EEG signals. Hence, we employ a novel class of orthogonal wavelet filter banks which are localized in time\u2013frequency domain to detect FC and NFC EEG signals automatically. We classify EEG signals as FC and NFC using the proposed wavelet based system. We compute various entropies from the wavelet coefficients of the signals.

In soft competitive learning each input signal is characterized by adapting in addition to the winner also some other neurons of the network. The GNN is also called the ANN with incremental learning. The artificial neural networks (ANN) mapping capability depends on the number of layers and the number of hidden layers in the structure of ANN. There is no formal way of computing network structure. Network structure is usually selected by trial-and-error method but it is time consuming process. Basically, we make use of two mechanisms that may modify the structure of the network: growth and pruning. In this paper, the competitive learning is firstly introduced; secondly the SOM topology and limitations of SOM are illustrated. Thirdly, a class of classical GNN with soft competitive learning is reviewed, such as Neural Gas Network (NGN), Growing Neural Gas (GNG), Self-Organizing Surfaces (SOS), Incremental Grid Growing (lGG), Evolve Self-Organizing Maps (ESOM), Growing Hierarchical Self-Organizing Map (GHSOM), and Growing Cell Structures (GCS).", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5120/2495-3372", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Computer Applications", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1983123911", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15709561", "15433082", "59847598", "59758775", "1526800", "37605601", "123948", "14507920", "108296383", "5957940", "950221", "274615", "39477", "15153673", "119643", "16030069"], "inbound_citations": ["50785961", "58925761"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6113259"}

Mexico has the world\u2019s fifth largest population of amphibians and the second country with the highest quantity of threatened amphibian species.

Recent studies have demonstrated that the risk of species decline depends on extrinsic and intrinsic traits, thus including both of them for assessing extinction might render more accurate assessment of threats. ::: ::: Methods. We harvested data from the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) and the published literature for Mexican amphibians, and used these data to assess the population trend of some of the Mexican species that have been assigned to the Data Deficient category of the IUCN using Random Forests, a Machine Learning method that gives a prediction of complex processes and identifies the most important variables that account for the predictions. ::: ::: Results. Our results show that most of the data deficient Mexican amphibians that we used have decreasing population trends. We found that Random Forests is a solid way to identify species with decreasing population trends when no demographic data is available. Moreover, we point to the most important variables that make species more vulnerable for extinction.

This question is important when applying human action classification to surveillance video that is noisy, crowded, complex and incomplete. In real-world scenarios, it is natural that a human can be occluded by an object while carrying out different actions. However, it is unclear how the performance of the proposed action descriptors are affected by the associated loss of information. In this paper, we evaluate and compare the classification performance of the state-of-art human local action descriptors in the presence of varying degrees of static occlusion. We consider four different local action descriptors: Trajectory (TRAJ), Histogram of Orientation Gradient (HOG), Histogram of Orientation Flow (HOF) and Motion Boundary Histogram (MBH). These descriptors are combined with a standard bag-of-features representation and a Support Vector Machine classifier for action recognition. We investigate the performance of these descriptors and their possible combinations with respect to varying amounts of artificial occlusion in the KTH action dataset.

This drastically reduces the sensitivity of the query -- often by several orders of magnitude -- which in turn reduces the amount of noise that must be added to preserve privacy. Our improved sensitivity is achieved by using \"smooth sensitivity\", which takes into account the specific data used in the query rather than assuming the worst-case scenario.

However, manufacturers and designers often misunderstand what consumers really want. Thus, acceptability evaluation and prediction is important in product development. This study developed an intelligent model to solve consumer acceptability problem in an attempt to evaluate consumer acceptability with better performance. The model adopted three well-known feature ranking methods to rank features of importance. In addition, it employed the Bayesian Network (BN), Radial Basis Function (RBF) Networks, Support Vector Machine\u2013Sequential Minimal Optimization (SVM\u2013SMO) and their ensembles to build prediction models.

The Weighted Majority algorithm and the randomized weighted majority (RWM) are the most well-known solutions to this problem, aiming to converge to the best expert. Since among some expert, the best one does not necessarily have the minimum error in all regions of data space, defining specific regions and converging to the best expert in each of these regions will lead to a better result.

We found 44 genes, identified using Support Vector Machine learning, which captured the diversity of complex innate immune responses with improved segregation between distinct stimuli.

The baseline model contained only user data and the augmented model contained both user and friends data. We employed five times two-fold cross-validation and the Wilcoxon signed rank test to validate our findings. The results suggest that the inclusion of friends data in our predictive model increases the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

Predicting the existence of bugs in source code changes could help developers detect and fix bugs immediately upon the completion of a change, which accelerates the bug fixing process and save the limited time and human resources effectively. However, because of altering nature in the underlying bug generation process, the concept used to depict the bug introducing patterns is drifting, which makes it difficult to predict latent bugs of source code changes accurately, especially in the long-term prediction scenario. In order to deal with this problem, a feature-based incremental learning framework is proposed. It is comprised of three components:(1) an incremental discretization method, which is used to transform the quantitive features in the corpus incrementally, (2) an incremental feature selection method, which is always keeping a subset with the most informative features, and (3) an incremental classification algorithm, which updates the classifier dynamically and considers the current best subset of features during prediction. This proposed approach is evaluated on three famous open source systems, Eclipse, Mozilla and jedit. The results show that our approach performs better than the non-incremental method in dealing with concept drift, with the consideration of keeping the value of both precision and recall stable at a suitable level over time.

The first attack allows membership inference without assumptions on the type of the generative model. Contrary to previous evaluation metrics for generative models, like Kernel Density Estimation, it only considers samples of the model which are close to training data records. The second attack specifically targets Variational Autoencoders, achieving high membership inference accuracy. Furthermore, previous work mostly considers membership inference adversaries who perform single record membership inference. We argue for considering regulatory actors who perform set membership inference to identify the use of specific datasets for training. The attacks are evaluated on two generative model architectures, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoen-coders (VAEs), trained on standard image datasets. Our results show that the two attacks yield success rates superior to previous work on most data sets while at the same time having only very mild assumptions. We envision the two attacks in combination with the membership inference attack type formalization as especially useful. For example, to enforce data privacy standards and automatically assessing model quality in machine learning as a service setups. In practice, our work motivates the use of GANs since they prove less vulnerable against information leakage attacks while producing detailed samples.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2478/popets-2019-0067", "venue": null, "journal": "Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2965527189", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6287870", "748227", "206590483", "195346843", "3412672", "207229839", "1033682", "3052834", "207190974", "18268744", "85488246", "5258236", "18466660", "10659969", "11758569", "10488675", "6844431", "2984526", "13583585", "702279", "16178966", "195346528"], "inbound_citations": ["210942951", "211132808", "214623088", "202539472", "209531691"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199546273"}

Moreover, many methods suffer from a drawback that they only use a single metric to evaluate disease similarity from an individual data source, which may result in biased conclusions without consideration of other aspects. In this study, we proposed a novel ontology-independent framework, namely RADAR, for learning representations for diseases to deduce their similarities from an integrative perspective. By leveraging the associations between diseases and disease-related biomedical entities, a disease similarity network was built under various metrics. Then a multi-layer disease similarity network was constructed by integrating multiple disease similarity networks derived from multiple data sources, where the representation learning was derived to provide a comprehensive evaluation of disease similarities.

A Random Forests machine learning model was built to automatically identify zooplankton in LOKI images. The model successfully distinguished between 114 different categories of zooplankton and particles. The high resolution taxonomical tree included many species, stages, as well as sub-groups based on animal orientation or condition in images. Results from a machine learning regression model of prosome length ( R 2 = 0.97 ) were used as a key predictor in the automatic identification model. Model internal validation of the automatic identification model on test data demonstrated that the model performed with overall high accuracy (86%) and specificity (86%). This was confirmed by confusion matrices for external testing results, based on automatic identifications for 2 complete stations. For station 101, from which images had also been used for training, accuracy and specificity were 85%. For station 126, from which images had not been used to train the model, accuracy and specificity were 81%. Further comparisons between model results and microscope identifications of zooplankton in samples from the two test stations were in good agreement for most taxa.

We further combine the holistic attention model, which focuses on the global consistency of the full human body, and the body part attention model, which focuses on the detailed description for different body parts. Hence our model has the ability to focus on different granularity from local salient regions to global semantic-consistent spaces. Additionally, we design novel Hourglass Residual Units (HRUs) to increase the receptive field of the network. These units are extensions of residual units with a side branch incorporating filters with larger receptive fields, hence features with various scales are learned and combined within the HRUs. The effectiveness of the proposed multi-context attention mechanism and the hourglass residual units is evaluated on two widely used human pose estimation benchmarks.

The identification of forest conditions for conservation in areas such as these is based on remote sensing techniques and classification methods.

The noise is the result of variations in terrain illumination resulting from complex topography and the mixture of different land cover types occurring at the sub-pixel level. Considering these issues, the selection of an optimum classification method to obtain accurate results is very important to support conservation activities. We carried out comparative non-parametric statistical analyses on the performance of several classifiers produced by three supervised machine-learning algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN). The SVM and RF methods were not significantly different in their ability to separate Andes mountain forest and shrubland land cover classes, and their best classifiers showed a significantly better classification accuracy (AUC values 0.81 and 0.79 respectively) than the one produced by the kNN method (AUC value 0.75) because the latter was more sensitive to noisy training data.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/rs10050782", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": "Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2804363015", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Geology"], "outbound_citations": ["130051971", "127590617", "129567154", "129099259", "120963229", "62527324", "9985555", "33542843", "16924438", "154890127", "129838630", "12411878", "18300910", "16808522", "129479680", "53694385", "56098160", "6906514", "8312711", "26333848", "62229412", "2357415", "53534362", "89141", "206787478", "13036541", "86115945", "10511727", "85256524", "122588669", "7553535", "120581754", "12231161", "129353090", "22630842", "62883674", "1117579", "82954532", "53124176", "119012412", "17531225", "120524587", "133714530", "127656397", "28637672", "73632754", "21940632", "13340986", "35485242"], "inbound_citations": ["144207661", "92668574", "53241814", "156055484"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:51965737"}

Recently, their class conditional extensions (e.g., conditional GAN (cGAN) and auxiliary classifier GAN (AC-GAN)) have attracted much attention owing to their ability to learn the disentangled representations and to improve the training stability. However, their training requires the availability of large-scale accurate class-labeled data, which are often laborious or impractical to collect in a real-world scenario. To remedy this, we propose a novel family of GANs called label-noise robust GANs (rGANs), which, by incorporating a noise transition model, can learn a clean label conditional generative distribution even when training labels are noisy. In particular, we propose two variants: rAC-GAN, which is a bridging model between AC-GAN and the label-noise robust classification model, and rcGAN, which is an extension of cGAN and solves this problem with no reliance on any classifier. In addition to providing the theoretical background, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our models through extensive experiments using diverse GAN configurations, various noise settings, and multiple evaluation metrics (in which we tested 402 conditions in total).", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1811.11165", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CVPR.2019.00257", "venue": "2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)", "journal": "2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2902649349,2962974744,2955193171", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["29767720", "6546734", "18828233", "2057420", "3481010", "52889459", "13890001", "5002792", "9417016", "1282515", "28111473", "12190952", "1033682", "10894094", "52065462", "195345871", "3707204", "6200260", "51876228", "16083709", "20954854", "44075864", "3568073", "8239952", "18268744", "211227", "3846544", "4053393", "1430496", "9996719", "12803511", "3366315", "423350", "1099052", "16406313", "11758569", "1515901", "1563370", "2181703", "58426597", "4321928", "16895865", "1687220", "8229065", "4544107", "8142135", "14989939", "6788443", "52049245", "41805341", "3699386", "206592873", "8858625", "7577075", "1082740", "6212000", "3162051", "3646966", "1277217", "29164161", "810708", "15876696", "4754947", "14924561", "206770979"], "inbound_citations": ["208309822", "209994181", "207904899", "211133282", "146120783", "209376451", "211020568", "204734150", "209202519", "208139191"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53774782"}

The aim is to learn the fine structural detail of medical images from high quality data sets acquired with long acquisition times or from bespoke devices and transfer that information to enhance lower quality data sets from standard acquisitions. We propose a framework for solving this problem using random forest regression to relate patches in the low-quality data set to voxel values in the high quality data set. Two examples in diffusion MRI demonstrate the idea. In both cases, we learn from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) data set, which uses an hour of acquisition time per subject, just for diffusion imaging, using custom built scanner hardware and rapid imaging techniques. The first example, super-resolution of diffusion tensor images (DTIs), enhances spatial resolution of standard data sets with information from the high-resolution HCP data. The second, parameter mapping, constructs neurite orientation density and dispersion imaging (NODDI) parameter maps, which usually require specialist data sets with two b-values, from standard single-shell high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) data sets with b = 1000 s mm\u2212 2.

For example, an algorithm may take as input a set of molecules, each labeled \"toxic\" or \"non-toxic\" and try to predict the toxicity of new molecules based on the function learned from the input. In the astronomy domain, one might try to predict the type of a star given a series of measurements of the star's brightness, based on a set of known stars and measurements of their brightness. The thesis investigates three aspects of machine learning algorithms that use linear classification functions that work implicitly in feature spaces by using similarity functions known as kernels. The first aspect is robustness to noise, that is learning when some of the labels in the known examples are not reliable. An extensive experimental evaluation reveals a surprising result, that the Perceptron Algorithm with margin is an excellent algorithm in such contexts, and it is competitive or better than more sophisticated alternatives. The second aspect is producing estimates of the confidence of predictions from such classifiers, especially Support Vector Machines. We explore this topic by proposing new methods and comparing them experimentally to existing approaches to this challenge. Finally we investigate kernels for the two applications mentioned above, time series from astronomy and molecules from biochemistry, where the data are not initially expressed in Euclidean space. In each case we provide an efficiently computable kernel function that captures a natural similarity between pairs of examples. An experimental evaluation shows that our kernels lead to excellent performance when used with Perceptron variants or Support Vector Machines.

Excellent LSSVR models were built with r = 0.998, standard error of prediction (SEP) = 0.111, for pH and r = 0.997, SEP = 0.256, for soluble solids content, and it can be found that the LSSVR models outperformed the PLS and RBF neural network models with higher accuracy and lower error. Six individual sensitive wavelengths for pH were obtained, and the corresponding pH determination model was developed with r = 0.994, SEP = 0.173, based on these six wavelengths. The soluble solids content determination model was also developed with r = 0.977, SEP = 0.173, based on seven individual sensitive wavelengths. The above results proved that Vis/NIR spectroscopy could be used to measure the pH and soluble solids content in tea beverages nondestructively, and LSSVR was an effective arithmetic for multivariate calibration regression and sensitive wavelengths selection.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11947-008-0101-y", "venue": null, "journal": "Food and Bioprocess Technology", "mag_id": "2000680628", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["97916407", "1055646", "9122914", "93879838", "17080108", "17162884", "215552080", "12366921", "104133607"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:95050327"}

At the same time there is a concerted effort in the machine learning community to expand the range of tasks in which learning can be applied as well as to utilize methods from other disciplines to accelerate learning. With this in mind, in the current work we suggest ways to enforce given constraints in the output of a GAN generator both for interpolation and extrapolation (prediction). For the case of dynamical systems, given a time series, we wish to train GAN generators that can be used to predict trajectories starting from a given initial condition. In this setting, the constraints can be in algebraic and/or differential form. Even though we are predominantly interested in the case of extrapolation, we will see that the tasks of interpolation and extrapolation are related. However, they need to be treated differently. For the case of interpolation, the incorporation of constraints is built into the training of the GAN. The incorporation of the constraints respects the primary game-theoretic setup of a GAN so it can be combined with existing algorithms. However, it can exacerbate the problem of instability during training that is well-known for GANs. We suggest adding small noise to the constraints as a simple remedy that has performed well in our numerical experiments. The case of extrapolation (prediction) is more involved. During training, the GAN generator learns to interpolate a noisy version of the data and we enforce the constraints. This approach has connections with model reduction that we can utilize to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the training. Depending on the form of the constraints, we may enforce them also during prediction through a projection step.

Since the information processing of different levels is completed in steps, the error generated from various steps will be accumulated and affect the accuracy of final results. However, because Deep Belief Network (DBN) model has the ability to automatically unsupervise learning of the advanced features from shallow text features, the model is employed to extract the academic activities transaction. In addition, we use character-based feature to describe the raw features of named entities of academic activity, so as to improve the accuracy of named entity recognition. In this paper, the accuracy of the academic activities extraction is compared by using character-based feature vector and word-based feature vector to express the text features, respectively, and with the traditional text information extraction based on Conditional Random Fields.

Decision-making models need accuracy for better outcomes. In this chapter, we have presented an application of Transfer Learning (TL) to detect open bone fracture using limited set of images. TL is a kind of self-evolving Deep Learning (DL) technique. In each iteration of TL, the model is improvised based on the knowledge transferred from the previously learned task. One of the research challenges in medical image analysis is the unavailability of large data set publicly. This data set is necessary for deep learning methods. There are many sources of image generation such as X-rays, CT scan, ECG, and Ultrasound. But, these images are not available to researchers due to privacy issue of the patients. In order to overcome this limitation of availability of large data set, we have used augmented data set. A small data set has been augmented to increase the image orientation and count. We have applied DL based Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) on medical images for overcoming the limitation of availability of large data set for training. We have attempted to solve the problem of open bone fracture detection using limited number of images. We have achieved this by applying Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) extractor on preprocessed radiograph images. SURF is a local feature descriptor and detector. The outcome of SURF extractor is then fed to per-trained models using transfer learning technique. Our proposed system would ease the manual process of identifying the presence and extremity of bone fracture. The proposed approach detects fracture from the given X-ray images with an accuracy of 98.8%. Comparative analysis shows that transfer learning gives significantly comparable results as compared to training model from scratch or even better in some cases.

The present study analyzed the extent to which treatment costs are related to patient-specific baseline variables (such as type and severity of the primary disease). ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: From 2000-2004, a bottom-up procedure was used to quantify total costs on 14 ICUs in nine German university hospitals. Results were combined with demographic data, and data indicating type (ICD-10 codes) and severity (ICU scoring systems) of the primary disease at ICU admission. Various statistical models were tested to identify that which best described the associations between baseline variables and costs. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: In all, 3803 critically ill patients could be examined. The median of treatment costs per patient was 3199 \u20ac (IQR 1768-6659 \u20ac). No model allowed an acceptably precise adjustment of costs; the estimated mean absolute prognostic error was at least 3860 \u20ac (mean relative prognostic error 66%), when we tested an Extreme Gradient Boosting Model. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Instruments which are currently available (cost adjustment based on patient-specific baseline variables) do not allow a standardization of costs, and an objective CUA of ICUs. Factors unknown at baseline may cause a large portion of treatment costs.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28623434", "doi": "10.1007/s00063-017-0315-8", "venue": "Medizinische Klinik, Intensivmedizin und Notfallmedizin", "journal": "Medizinische Klinik, Intensivmedizin und Notfallmedizin", "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195668741"}

We demonstrate single trial decoding of naturalistic stimuli based on scalp EEG acquired with user-friendly, portable, 32 dry electrode equipment. We show that Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers trained on a relatively small set of denoised (averaged) trials perform at par with classifiers trained on a large set of noisy samples. We propose a novel method for computing sensitivity maps on EEG-based SVM classifiers for visualization of the EEG signatures exploited by SVM classifiers. We apply the NPAIRS framework for estimation of map uncertainty. We show that effect size plots are similar for classifiers trained on small samples of denoised data and large samples of noisy data. We conclude that the average category classifier can successfully predict on single-trial subjects, allowing for fast classifier training, parameter optimization and unbiased performance evaluation.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1101/481630", "venue": null, "journal": "bioRxiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2902234532", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["1579709", "196677151", "11242236", "10505383", "15948894", "17038958", "8271268", "215179559", "54469209", "18354450", "14113767", "5008924", "9599171", "13032027", "10788863", "10659969", "8337658", "9753972", "1962625", "1609402", "14032142", "17635121", "1402496", "14752624", "54330437", "14546435", "4303570", "34029206"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:91495526"}
