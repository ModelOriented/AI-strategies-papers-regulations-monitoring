Such time series include information about changes in economic, weather and health values, as well as information about changes in values of operation sensors of technical objects during a quite long period. The most difficult task of classification of such long time series using probabilistic graphical models with hidden states is the selection of the optimum number of hidden states. This work proposes a method for automatic selection of the optimum number of hidden states of the model in the course of the model learning. The model proposed in the article and the methods of its learning are based on a combination of elements used in the metric and Bayesian approaches to classification. The basic NGGM purpose is to match hidden states of a graphical model and nodes (neurons) of the approximating grid. Comparative assessment of the quality of the proposed NGGM model classification with the currently most common time series classification models has been made: the HMM (Hidden Markov Model) and the HCRF (Hidden Conditional Random Fields) applied at the data sets from the UCI repository. The quality was assessed by the macro-average F-measure criterion using the k-fold cross-validation. As a result of classification quality analysis, it was noted that the proposed NGGM model showed better classification quality on the data set being a set of multiple, labeled samples of pen tip trajectories recorded whilst writing individual characters than the HCRF and HMM models.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5539/mas.v9n2p108", "venue": null, "journal": "Mathematical Models and Methods in Applied Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2097739559", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["64760951", "17884783", "17200429", "2376674", "67408370", "2436991", "1744924", "17388986", "14995779", "14835425", "59758775", "15784531", "123092888", "13618539", "13553050", "19012180"], "inbound_citations": ["212699788"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55928606"}

Recently, many devices provide a feature using handwritten as an input such as laptops, smartphones, and others, affecting handwritten recognition abilities become important thing.

The outcome of that recognizing system has to be quite accurate, the results of the process will impact on the entire process of understanding the Qur\u2019an lesson. Basically handwritten recognition problem is part of classification problem and one of the best algorithm to solve it is Support Vector Machine (SVM). By finding a best separate line and two other support lines between input space data in process of training, SVM can provide the better result than other classify algorithm. Although SVM can solve the classify problem well, SVM must be modified with kernel learning method to be able to classify nonlinear data. However, determining the best kernel for every classification problem is quite difficult. Therefore, some technique have been developed, one of them is Multi Kernel Learning (MKL). This technique works by combining some kernel function to be one kernel with an equation. This framework built an application to recognize handwritten arabic numeral character using SVM algorithm that modified with Kernel Learning Method. The result shows that the application can recognize data well with average value of Accuracy is 84,37%", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.22219/kinetik.v4i2.724", "venue": "Kinetik: Game Technology, Information System, Computer Network, Computing, Electronics, and Control", "journal": "Kinetik: Game Technology, Information System, Computer Network, Computing, Electronics, and Control", "mag_id": "2921564595", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:88483827"}

The capability of multi-season images of RapidEye, a new generation high spatial resolution (5 m) space-borne sensor containing an additional red-edge band, was evaluated for the classification of several wetland and dryland communities. RapidEye images were obtained for four seasons (winter, spring, summer and autumn) between 2011 and 2012 for a subtropical coastal region of South Africa. The separability of nine wetland and dryland communities was assessed for each season using the Partial Least Square Random Forest (PLS-RF) algorithm. The four-seasons approach yielded a higher overall classification accuracy (OA = 86 \u00b1 2.8%) when compared to using any single-season classification. The highest single-season accuracies were obtained in spring (80 \u00b1 2.9%), summer (80 \u00b1 3.1%), and autumn (79 \u00b1 3.4%) compared to the winter (66 \u00b1 3.1%).

This report introduces a robust framework for pose-free tracking of non-rigid face. Our method consists of two phases: training and tracking. In the training phase, a large offline synthesized database is built to train landmark appearance models using linear Support Vector Machine (SVM). In the tracking phase, a two-step approach is proposed: the first step, namely initialization, benefits 2D SIFT matching between the current frame and a set of adaptive keyframes to estimate the rigid parameters. The second step obtains the whole set of parameters (rigid and non-rigid) using a heuristic method via pose-wise SVMs. The combination of these aspects makes our method work robustly up to 90\u00b0 of vertical axial rotation. Moreover, our method appears to be robust even in the presence of fast movements and tracking losses. Comparing to other published algorithms, our method offers a very good compromise of rigid and non-rigid parameter accuracies. This study gives a promising perspective because of the good results in terms of pose estimation (average error is less than 4\u00b0on BUFT dataset) and landmark tracking precision (5.8 pixel error compared to 6.8 of one state-of-the-art method on Talking Face video).

For some brain functions, the network architectures can even be quite simple. Flip-flops are the basic building blocks of sequential logic systems. Certain flip-flops can be configured to function as oscillators. The novel flip-flops and oscillators proposed here are composed of two to six neurons, and their operation depends only on the minimal neuron capabilities of excitation and inhibition. These networks generate neural correlates of so many major phenomena of short-term memory and electroencephalography in such detail that the possibility of the brain producing the phenomena with fundamentally different network architectures is remote. For example, cascaded oscillators can produce the periodic activity commonly known as brainwaves by enabling the state changes of many networks simultaneously. (The function of such oscillator-induced synchronization in information processing systems is timing error avoidance.) Then the boundary separating the alpha and beta frequency bands is where \u03bcd and \u03c3d are the mean and standard deviation (in milliseconds) of delay times of neurons that make up the initial ring oscillators in the cascades.

These sources can include audio type (speech, music, background noise, ect.), speaker identity and channel characteristics. With the continually increasing number of larges volumes of spoken documents including broadcasts, voice mails, meetings and telephone conversations, diarization has received a great deal of interest in recent years which significantly impacts performances of automatic speech recognition and audio indexing systems. A subtype of audio diarization, where the speech segments of the signal are broken into different speakers, is speaker diarization. It generally answers to the question \"Who spoke when?\" and it is divided in two modules: speaker segmentation and speaker clustering. This chapter discusses the problem of automatically detecting speaker change points presented in a given audio stream, without prior acoustic information on the speakers. We introduce a new unsupervised speaker segmentation technique based on One Class Support Vector Machines (1-SVMs) robust to different acoustic conditions. We evaluated the robustness improvements of this method by segmenting different types of audio stream (broadcast news, meetings and telephone conversations) and comparing the results with model selection segmentation techniques based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC).", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5772/8540", "venue": "Signal Processing", "journal": "Signal Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2165706241", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5090074", "2991859", "1271131", "54040858", "18636269", "9027572", "16307433", "16887618", "13624754", "164599", "9596643", "156563", "279049", "15558505", "52869628", "6939934", "1138329", "15668642", "14777447", "122523543", "15406718", "11553829", "7937856", "64543020", "2198181", "8618917", "17059930"], "inbound_citations": ["18789512"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54193789"}

In nature, D. melanogaster is a fruit generalist, feeding on diets rich in simple carbohydrates. Other Drosophilids, however, have specialized on distinct resources. Drosophila mojavensis, for example, is endemic to the Sonoran Desert, where it feeds on necrotic cacti which are low in carbohydrates. Its close relative Drosophila arizonae is cactophilic as well, but is also found breeding in fruits containing simple sugars. Previous studies have shown that high-sugar diets negatively affect the larval development of D. mojavensis and increase their triglyceride content, compared to D. melanogaster. More general metabolic profiles, in response to these different diets, however, have yet to be produced for any of the species. In addition, because D. arizonae appears somewhat intermediate between D. melanogaster and D. mojavensis in its development times and survival under the above mentioned diets, its general metabolic profiles are also of interest. Thus, in the present study we ask to what extent the general metabolism of these three different Drosophila species is affected by diets of distinct protein-sugar ratios.

Theoretical properties of these statistical methods can be established, but only under the assumption of a fixed order of smoothness.

For fault prevention, many fault diagnostic methods based on vibration signals are available in the literature. However, the vibration signals are obtained by using different types of sensors, which can cause sensor installation issues and damage the rotating machinery. In addition, this kind of data acquisition through vibration signal induces a large amount of signal noise during machine operation, which will challenge the later fault diagnosis. A recent fault detection method based on infrared thermography (IRT) for rotating machinery avoids these issues. However, the corresponding literature is limited by the fact that the characteristics of the manual design cannot characterize the fault completely so that the diagnostic accuracy cannot exceed the diagnostic method based on the vibration signals. This paper introduces a popular image feature extraction method into the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery based on IRT for the first time. First, capturing the IRT images of the rotating machinery in different states, and then two popular feature extraction methods for IRT images, bag-of-visual-word, and convolutional neural network, are tested in turn. Finally, the extracted features are classified to implement the automatic fault diagnosis. The developed method is applied to analyze the experimental IRT images collected from bearings, and the results demonstrate that the developed method is more effective than the traditional methods based on vibration signals.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2893331", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2910029951", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["126310320", "13472202", "18925565", "5038723", "55155005", "111206101", "122217736", "125160241", "62694623", "107053945", "109454408", "125852633", "31594113", "125829653", "125392032", "62488931", "110083930", "26886480", "44915194", "122175292", "124784481", "31734694", "111217108", "15880915", "111065412", "17606900", "9257996", "4071727", "34398695", "130535382", "14361759", "5258236", "2420060", "19150408", "961425", "7587645"], "inbound_citations": ["210930402", "208037744", "202127559", "211146257", "115199410", "209376485"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59620640"}

This approach makes the detector highly dependent on the learner, which can be problematic in some situations, for example, when the learner includes adaptability mechanisms, when it is unable to converge, or when it shows a high overfitting. Ultimately, the concept drift is something that happens in the data, not learners, so detecting drifts indirectly through a learner\u2019s performance adds bias into the result. Besides, it makes the process highly inefficient. This paper proposes a new mechanism to detect concept drifts without supervising the learning process. The data distribution is summarized in univariate histograms based on which an on-line straightforward prediction is made. It proves us a measure that is monitored over time for detecting changes in data. The method is extremely efficient, as the time and space complexity to process each sample is linear to the number of input variables multiplied by the number of classes.

A regular transfer learning network occupies about 202.6 MB performing at up to 92 % accuracy rate for the scene recognition. It is revealed that deleting the layers is not reasonable. The network size is reduced by setting a fewer number of filters in the 17th and 20th layers of the AlexNet-based networks using a dichotomy principle or similar.

The classification of HSI is one of the most challenging tasks due to the large amount of spectral information and the presence of redundant and irrelevant bands. Although great progresses have been made on classification techniques, few studies have been done to provide practical guidelines to determine the appropriate classifier for HSI. In this paper, we investigate the performance of four supervised learning algorithms, namely, Support Vector Machines SVM, Random Forest RF, K-Nearest Neighbors KNN and Linear Discriminant Analysis LDA with different kernels in terms of classification accuracies. The experiments have been performed on three real hyperspectral datasets taken from the NASA\u2019s Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer Sensor AVIRIS and the Reflective Optics System Imaging Spectrometer ROSIS sensors. The mutual information had been used to reduce the dimensionality of the used datasets for better classification efficiency. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the SVM classifier with RBF kernel and RF produced statistically better results and seems to be respectively the more suitable as supervised classifiers for the hyperspectral remote sensing images.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.procs.2019.01.013", "venue": null, "journal": "Procedia Computer Science", "mag_id": "2918094137", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["202752755"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:86786655"}

Difficulties arise when State and action spaces are continuous as dassical RL algorithms are not feasible or convergent. Actor-critic approaches solve these issues by combining the convergence of policy-gradient methods with the representation power of function approximators, in a low variance estimation. Transfer Learning is the paradigm that addresses the problem of transferring past experience from different tasks when the agent is facing a new, unknown one. Its purpose is to develop algorithms that speed-up the new learning process by leveraging the past knowledge. Advances concerning TL in RL have been developed in the recent years, but most of them focus on transfer higher level information like value functions or policies. The Lipschitz continuity property, a stronger notion of continuity for the elements of the task, can provide enough information to create sample-level transfer mechanisms to extend the Actor-Critic methods. This thesis introduces two such mechanisms based on weighted estimators: one performs an optimistic selection of the weights and the other a pessimistic one. Both techniques are compared with a transfer mechanism based on Importance Sampling estimators. The optimistic approach produces good results in most of the experimental cases, showing itself as a promising alternative over the IS-based one and the no transfer scenario. The pessimistic approach, instead, tends to be too conservative on the selection of the weights, and offers no special improvements with respect to the no transfer scenario.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2912378398", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:86786708"}

Its rapidly growing worldwide popularity makes the notable social networking services like Twitter a potentially large information base. People use tweets to share opinions and sentiments about what is going on around them, and sentiment analysis of these short informal texts is now attracting increasing attentions. However, some distinct characteristics of tweets, such as the creative spelling and punctuation, genre-specific terminology, bring new challenges, more than simply applying the traditional information extraction technologies that have been proved successful in the Web corpus. In this thesis, we design a sentiment analysis system based on Support Vector Machine classication model, leveraging a variety of stylistic, lexical, and syntactic feature. With external resources like Tweet-NLP and emoticon dictionary, we propose a tweet-specific preprocessing method to handle the informal text genres of tweets. Besides, in order to extract contextual interactions among words for sentiment analysis, we incorporate dependency paring by Stanford Parser in our system, which give our system competitive advantage in SemEval-2015 Task10: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter. Our system placed sixth in the message-level task on the Twitter2015 test set, obtaining a macro-averaged F-score of 63.00. Finally, we compare the performance of classifier with different feature combinations by ablation experiments, and the results reveal that the syntactic feature and the lexical feature based on automatic tweet-specific sentiment lexicons are the most influential feature groups in our sentiment analysis system, providing gains of 2-7 percentage points on test datasets.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.14711/thesis-b1514648", "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2913283656", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:86814591"}

However, it is well known that local metric learning (i) can entail overfitting and (ii) face difficulties to compare two instances that are assigned to two different local models. In this paper, we address these two issues by introducing a novel metric learning algorithm that linearly combines local models (C2LM). Starting from a partition of the space in regions and a model (a score function) for each region, C2LM defines a metric between points as a weighted combination of the models. A weight vector is learned for each pair of regions, and a spatial regularization ensures that the weight vectors evolve smoothly and that nearby models are favored in the combination. The proposed approach has the particularity of working in a regression setting, of working implicitly at different scales, and of being generic enough so that it is applicable to similarities and distances. We prove theoretical guarantees of the approach using the framework of algorithmic robustness.

Modular models (MMs) designed to work on different parts of the hydrograph are preferred ways to implement such approach. Previous studies have suggested that better predictions of total streamflow could be obtained via modular Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) trained to perform an implicit baseflow separation. These MMs fit separately the baseflow and excess flow components as produced by a digital filter, and reconstruct the total flow by adding these two signals at the output. The optimization of the filter parameters and ANN architectures is carried out through global search techniques. Despite the favorable premises, the real effectiveness of such MMs has been tested only on a few case studies, and the quality of the baseflow separation they perform has never been thoroughly assessed. In this work, we compare the performance of MM against global models (GMs) for nine different gaging stations in the northern United States. Binary-coded swarm optimization is employed for the identification of filter parameters and model structure, while Extreme Learning Machines, instead of ANN, are used to drastically reduce the large computational times required to perform the experiments. The results show that there is no evidence that MM outperform global GM for predicting the total flow. In addition, the baseflow produced by the MM largely underestimates the actual baseflow component expected for most of the considered gages. This occurs because the values of the filter parameters maximizing overall accuracy do not reflect the geological characteristics of the river basins. The results indeed show that setting the filter parameters according to expert knowledge results in accurate baseflow separation but lower accuracy of total flow predictions, suggesting that these two objectives are intrinsically conflicting rather than compatible.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.08.008", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Hydrology", "mag_id": "1412975512", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["59541262", "203708940", "159137965", "159235061", "125949562", "159038053", "51419357", "4561014", "59251960", "124152565", "197532038", "143424429", "212742055", "135124372", "125987949", "42448397", "135354181", "135072586", "134672032", "52275891", "127323130", "55158587", "102330779", "134102055", "49421171", "4982707", "182203519", "126229286", "69258480", "133832933", "126284944", "209496892", "135218673", "197562088", "31880812", "155108339", "135301066", "158347203", "210914058", "69241751", "127166788", "3821365", "207828592", "134745581", "163164304", "51965790", "198992534", "67773027", "195248260", "5036532", "102354007", "55006966", "43982719", "158194624", "53116804", "57241053", "45284961", "182020553", "203127315", "69839567", "127403799", "133863167", "27207857", "126124836", "191172380"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:127939299"}

The target of a focused crawler (FC) is to retrieve pages related to a specific domain of interest (DOI). However, FCs may be hasted if bad links were injected into their crawling queue. Hence, they will be gradually skewed away from their DOI. This paper introduces an effective modification on the behavior of FCs by adding a domain distiller. Hence, before passing the retrieved page to the indexer or embedding its links into the crawling queue, the page must pass through a domain distiller. The proposed domain distiller relies on an Optimized Nave Bayes (ONB) classifier, which combines nave Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Initially, genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize the soft margins of SVM. Then the optimized SVM is employed to eliminate the outliers from the available training examples. Next, the pruned examples are used to train the traditional NB classifier. Moreover, ONB employs word sense disambiguation (WSD) to identify the accurate sense of each domain keyword extracted from the input page. This is accomplished by using a proposed domain ontology, which is called Disambiguation Domain Ontology (D2O). ONB has been tested against recent classification techniques. Experimental results have proven the effectiveness of ONB as it introduces the maximum classification accuracy.

For chemical property prediction, transfer learning models represent a promising approach for addressing the data scarcity limitations of many properties by utilizing potentially abundant data from one or more adjacent applications. Transfer learning models typically utilize a latent variable that is common to several prediction tasks and provides a mechanism for information exchange between tasks. For chemical applications, it is still largely unknown how correlation between the prediction tasks affects performance, the limitations on the number of tasks that can be simultaneously trained in these models before incurring performance degradation, and if transfer learning positively or negatively affects ancillary model properties. Here we investigate these questions using an autoencoder latent space as a latent variable for transfer learning models for predicting properties from the QM9 dataset that have been supplemented with semi-empirical quantum chemistry calculations. We demonstrate that property prediction can be counter-intuitively improved by utilizing a simpler linear predictor model, which has the effect of forcing the latent space to reorganize linearly with respect to each property. In data scarce prediction tasks, the transfer learning improvement is dramatic, whereas in data rich prediction tasks, there appears to be little to no adverse impact of transfer learning on prediction performance.

In the recognition of epileptic EEG signals, traditional intelligent methods usually assume that the training dataset and testing dataset have the same distribution, and the data available for training are adequate. However, these two conditions cannot always be met in practice, which reduces the ability of the intelligent recognition model obtained in detecting epileptic EEG signals. To overcome this issue, an effective strategy is to introduce transfer learning in the construction of the intelligent models, where knowledge is learned from the related scenes (source domains) to enhance the performance of model trained in the current scene (target domain). Although transfer learning has been used in EEG signal identification, many existing transfer learning techniques are designed only for a specific intelligent model, which limit their applicability to other classical intelligent models. To extend the scope of application, the generalized hidden-mapping transductive learning method is proposed to realize transfer learning for several classical intelligent models, including feedforward neural networks, fuzzy systems, and kernelized linear models. These intelligent models can be trained effectively by the proposed method even though the data available are insufficient for model training, and the generalization abilities of the trained model is also enhanced by transductive learning.

Typically, DRAM module is composed of DRAM ICs (integrated circuit). DRAM ICs with higher quality can be used to produce DRAM modules with higher quality. Generlly speaking, high quality DRAM ICs are more costly. Due the the cost down and material saving reason, some DRAM module manufacturers purchase batches DRAM ICs containing defective units, and then have the batch tested in order to select DRAM ICs for production of DRAM modules. Thus, this kind of DRAM module is suitable only for products not intended for work in harsh environments being sold in lower price markets. Due to the lower quality of the DRAM ICs, the actual quality of the DRAM module is not easily predicted. Predicting the yield rate of the DRAM module is thus an important issue for DRAM module manufacturers who purchase DRAM ICs with lower quality at lower prices. This study used support vector regression (SVR) to predict the yield rate of the DRAM modules produced using defective DRAM ICs. SVR is a very capable method and has been successfully applied across many fields. However, the parameters and input features differ depending on the application. Thus, a scatter search (SS) approach is proposed to obtain the suitable parameters for the SVR and to select the beneficial subset of features which result in a better prediction of the DRAM module yield rate. The experimental results showed that the performance is better than that of traditional stepwise regression analysis.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-1-84882-762-2_71", "venue": "Advanced Concurrent Engineering", "journal": "Advanced Concurrent Engineering", "mag_id": "80860381", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["28949163"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59660031"}

Genetic Algorithms (GA) have been used before to determine parameters of a network. Yet, GAs perform a finite search over a discrete set of pre-defined candidates, and cannot, in general, generate unseen configurations. In this paper, to move from exploration to exploitation, we propose a novel and systematic method that autonomously and simultaneously optimizes multiple parameters of any deep neural network by using a GA aided by a bi-generative adversarial network (Bi-GAN). The proposed Bi-GAN allows the autonomous exploitation and choice of the number of neurons, for fully-connected layers, and number of filters, for convolutional layers, from a large range of values. Our proposed Bi-GAN involves two generators, and two different models compete and improve each other progressively with a GAN-based strategy to optimize the networks during GA evolution. Our proposed approach can be used to autonomously refine the number of convolutional layers and dense layers, number and size of kernels, and the number of neurons for the dense layers; choose the type of the activation function; and decide whether to use dropout and batch normalization or not, to improve the accuracy of different deep neural network architectures. Without loss of generality, the proposed method has been tested with the ModelNet database, and compared with the 3D Shapenets and two GA-only methods.

The parameters representing the hyperplane are adopted as the representative of the class, which is unique. The second class is the global equivalent class which is derived by additional sign change and permutation on the components of the BF class representatives.

This paper introduces a novel machine learning approach to automatically extract DTMs from their corresponding DSMs. We first classify each point as being either ground or nonground, using supervised learning techniques applied to a variety of features. For the points which are classified as ground, we use the LiDAR measurements as an estimate of the surface height, but, for the nonground points, we have to interpolate between nearby values, which we do using a Gaussian random field. Since our model contains both discrete and continuous latent variables, and is a discriminative (rather than generative) probabilistic model, we call it a hybrid conditional random field.

Study Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Tertiary referral center. Patients: Seventy-five patients with vestibular dysfunction and 163 healthy controls were retrospectively recruited. The dataset included the velocity, the envelopment area, the power spectrum of the COP for three frequency ranges and the presence of peripheral vestibular dysfunction evaluated by caloric testing in 75 patients with vestibular dysfunction and 163 healthy controls. Main Outcome Measures: Various forms of machine learning algorithms including the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree, Bagging Classifier, and Logistic Regression were trained. Validation and comparison were performed using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and the recall of each algorithm using K-fold cross-validation. Results: The AUC (0.90 \u00b1 0.06) and the recall (0.84 \u00b1 0.07) of the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree were the highest among the algorithms tested, and both of them were significantly higher than those of the logistic regression (AUC: 0.85 \u00b1 0.08, recall: 0.78 \u00b1 0.07). The recall of the Bagging Classifier (0.82 \u00b1 0.07) was also significantly higher than that of logistic regression. Conclusion: Machine learning algorithms can be successfully used to predict vestibular dysfunction as identified using caloric testing with the dataset of the COP sway during posturography. The multiple algorithms should be evaluated in each clinical dataset since specific algorithm does not always fit to any dataset.

RF is a popular and useful tool for non-linear multi-variate classification and regression, which yields a good trade-off between robustness (low variance) and adaptiveness (low bias). Direct interpretation of a RF model is difficult, as the explicit ensemble model of hundreds of deep trees is complex. Nonetheless, it is possible to visualize a RF model fit by its mapping from feature space to prediction space. Hereby the user is first presented with the overall geometrical shape of the model structure, and when needed one can zoom in on local details. Dimensional reduction by projection is used to visualize high dimensional shapes. The traditional method to visualize RF model structure, partial dependence plots, achieve this by averaging multiple parallel projections. We suggest to first use feature contributions, a method to decompose trees by splitting features, and then subsequently perform projections. The advantages of forest floor over partial dependence plots is that interactions are not masked by averaging. As a consequence, it is possible to locate interactions, which are not visualized in a given projection.

A number of research programs at UCLA utilize connectionist modeling strategies, ranging from distributed and localist spreading-activation networks to semantic networks with symbolic marker passing. As a way of combining and optimizing the advantages offered by different paradigms, we have started to explore hybrid networks, i.e. multiple processing mechanisms operating on a single network, or multiple networks operating in parallel under different paradigms. Unfortunately, existing tools do not allow the simulation of these types of hybrid connectionist architectures. To address this problem, we have developed a tool which enables us to create and operate these types of networks in a flexible and general way. We present and describe the architecture and use of Descartes, a simulation environment developed to accomplish this type of integration. Introduction and Motivation Within the connectionist approach there are three paradigms, each having its own advantages and disadvantages: Distributed Connectionist Networks (DCNs), Localist Connectionist Networks (LCNs), and Marker-Passing Networks (MPNs). DCNs (such as the models in [Rumelhart & McClelland, 1986]) use simple, neuron-like processing elements which represent knowledge as distributed patterns of activation. DCNs, sometimes known as Parallel Distributed Processing or subsymbolic models, are interesting because they have learning rules that allow stochastic category generalization, they perform noise-resistant associative retrieval, and they exhibit robustness to damage. Distributed models, however, have (so far) been sequential at the knowledge level, lacking both the structure needed to handle complex conceptual relationships and the ability to handle dynamic variable bindings and to compute rules. LCNs (as exemplified by the models of [Waltz & Pollack, 1985] and [Shastri, 1988]) also use simple, neuron-like processing elements with numeric activation and output functions, but represent knowledge using semantic networks of conceptual nodes and their interconnections. Unlike DCNs, localist networks are parallel at the knowledge level and have structural relationships between concepts built into the connectivity of the network. Unfortunately, they lack the powerful learning and generalization capabilities of DCNs. They also have had difficulty with dynamic variable bindings and most other capabilities of symbolic models. MPNs (as exemplified by the models of [Charniak, 1986] and [Hendler, 1988]) also represent knowledge in semantic networks and retain parallelism at the knowledge level. Instead of spreading numeric activation values, MPNs propagate symbolic markers, and so support the variable binding necessary for rule application, while preserving the full power of symbolic systems. On the other hand, they do not possess the learning capabilities of DCNs or exhibit the inherent evidential constraint-satisfaction capabilities of LCNs. Hybrid Connectionist Models Research at UCLA has spanned the range from subsymbolic to symbolic connectionist models [Dyer, 1989]. A number of us have begun to construct hybrid architectures which use what we term Multiple Interacting Networks, or MINs, heterogeneous connectionist networks that communicate via shared elements. A neurophysiological approach [Nenov & Dyer, 1988] effectively uses MINs for visual/verbal association by modeling heterogeneous neuronal characteristics in separate networks. We have also been exploring the use of MINs for higher cognitive tasks, such as planning, creativity, story invention, and political negotiations. In political negotiations research, for instance, MINs are used to simulate the multiple perspectives of negotiating parties. Another approach is to build models that combine the bottom-up processing features of DCNs with the top-down processing features of LCNs and MPNs. Figure 1 shows Hiding Pot, an example wherein elements from each paradigm are combined using MINs. This allows us to approach a problem that would be difficult, if not impossible, using a single paradigm. Hiding Pot shows a simplified network built to understand the sentence, \"John put the pot inside the dishwasher because the police were coming.\"1 Network-A in Figure 1 utilizes an MPN to do role-binding and an LCN to activate and combine evidence for individual schemas. These then combine their functionality to support predictions and perform inferencing and disambiguation. One might also want to combine different connectionist approaches by having separate networks that communicate with each other, where each one performs a different cognitive task. Network-B in Figure 1 is a DCN, trained to recognize words from line segments [McClelland & Rumelhart, 1986, chap. 1]. By integrating these two approaches, we can simulate cognitive processes at the different levels of abstraction necessary for modeling reading and understanding. Network-A interacts with Network-B through shared lexical nodes. Once a word has been recognized, it passes activation to the concepts related to the word. For example, the node for concept John gets activation from the word node \"john\" which is shared by both networks. Activation then propagates along the chain of related concepts in the network as contextual evidence for disambiguation. Markers are passed over the role nodes across marker passing links between corresponding roles to represent role-bindings and perform the needed inferencing. While there are several existing connectionist simulators, none allows the simulation of multiple interacting hybrid networks, as in Hiding Pot, that integrate elements from more than one paradigm of connectionist modelling. We have developed the Descartes simulation environment specifically to address this kind of integration. Descartes enables researchers to design, simulate, and debug hybrid connectionist architectures that combine elements of distributed, localist, and marker-passing networks. Descartes Architecture Descartes is a package designed for simulating network processing, network interaction, and integration of networks into an overall processing environment. The system consists of two interactive components: network elements, such as nodes and links, their associations, and their functionality, and processing controllers, which organize network elements and coordinate their processing. The components of this architecture, as applied to Hiding Pot, are shown in Figure 2. 1. The inferencing and frame selection needed to understand sentences such as Hiding Pot is explained more thoroughly in [Lange & Dyer, 1989a] and [Lange & Dyer, 1989b], which describe Robin, a model of high-level inferencing using an LCN without marker-passing.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "117587600", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["46986525", "124142", "62663063", "13283101", "19153159", "58331216", "17836106", "27559749"], "inbound_citations": ["63580929", "357968", "14687886", "17414553", "16060305", "28840097", "16735689"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54132208"}

This is often done by adding a geometry-based regularization term in the objective function of a supervised learning model. In this case, a similarity graph is indispensable to exploit the geometrical relationships among the training data points, and the graph construction scheme essentially determines the performance of these graph-based learning algorithms. However, most of the existing works construct the graph empirically and are usually based on a single feature without using the label information. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised annotation approach by learning an optimized graph (OGL) from multi-cues (i.e., partial tags and multiple features), which can more accurately embed the relationships among the data points. Since OGL is a transductive method and cannot deal with novel data points, we further extend our model to address the out-of-sample issue. Extensive experiments on image and video annotation show the consistent superiority of OGL over the state-of-the-art methods.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "27552746", "doi": "10.1109/TIP.2016.2601260", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2513281263", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["14591124", "2768", "10747436", "3945785", "3007089", "554484", "15942064", "26498943", "207184031", "1052837", "508435", "16902615", "6035769", "4922586", "3239384", "207202940", "171130", "1433592", "16187052", "3975366", "32092054", "32566240", "3693305", "17871103", "18764978", "3172398", "344242", "33982236", "14697192", "8329460", "2105943", "6240314", "9702087", "7074492", "2643381", "207184031", "13407903", "15571753", "17064437", "16228361", "12212640", "7549717", "7462498", "16320499", "10290905", "5705701", "20808766", "9344331", "10031998", "12833578", "2829728", "14503841", "7016601", "14940757", "8220073", "8902853"], "inbound_citations": ["4023525", "4023525", "25497516", "51615798", "69307948", "62880080", "52272562", "51629981", "52050406", "31391464", "21780790", "208869769", "204228906", "57189218", "51890871", "54438899", "53862488", "160013159", "3510078", "4974602", "53236779", "201146408", "53588990", "2254770", "52048315", "28532912", "56480721", "198190820", "33726834", "39524656", "46955292", "10974232", "3698507", "7263355", "9713027", "9713027", "52974304", "3522623", "46897324", "4317657", "58010160", "49305582", "3438487", "27767604", "19326681", "45854355", "209896701", "52048612", "173188988", "46964543", "69278600", "4947627", "4365701", "208089962", "208649436", "77394765", "46957554", "52155868", "32423561", "72936460", "86396620"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2744581"}

Along with EEG recordings, inter-ictal discharges, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, structural placement of the epileptogenic zone and clinical description, are used in the study. The key step involved in the analysis, is to create an algorithm that shapes the problem into an appropriate machine learning framework, identifying the features, forward modeling of the extracted features and finally classifying them as epileptic seizures arising from the location on the right or left region of the brain. The feature extraction is done by independent component analysis (ICA) with spatially filtered eight spectral features per components. These features are classified using Support Vector Machines with radial basis function kernels (SVM) and Proximal SVM. A comparative study is done for evaluating specificity and sensitivity using segments of ICA data.

In this work, we model the progression from a counting-based strategy for addition to a recall-based strategy. The model consists of two networks working in parallel: a slower basal ganglia loop and a faster cortical network. The slow network methodically computes the count from one digit given another, corresponding to the addition of two digits, whereas the fast network gradually \"memorizes\" the output from the slow network. The faster network eventually learns how to add the same digits that initially drove the behavior of the slower network. Performance of this model is demonstrated by simulating a fully spiking neural network that includes basal ganglia, thalamus, and various cortical areas. Consequently, the model incorporates various neuroanatomical data, in terms of brain areas used for calculation and makes psychologically testable predictions related to frequency of rehearsal. Furthermore, the model replicates developmental progression through addition strategies in terms of reaction times and accuracy, and naturally explains observed symptoms of dyscalculia.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28019687", "doi": "10.1111/tops.12242", "venue": "Topics in cognitive science", "journal": "Topics in cognitive science", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2562615351,2786067931", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine", "Psychology"], "outbound_citations": ["140205603", "5799133", "16545209", "60125307", "15230674", "5943414", "3684955", "206987063", "14483411", "10945948", "39877717", "16066332", "144258200", "5938510"], "inbound_citations": ["209370881", "12188223", "64941290", "214873039"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:9896003"}

Flexible Analytic Wavelet Transform (FAWT) technique is used to decompose the ECG beats. Cross Information Potential (CIP) parameter is computed from the real values of detail coefficients of FAWT based decomposition. For CAD subjects mean value of CIP parameter is found higher in comparison to normal subjects. Thereafter, Student's t-test method and Kruskal\u2013Wallis statistical test are applied to check the discrimination ability of the extracted features. Further, the features are fed to Least Squares-Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) for performing the classification. Classification accuracy is computed at every decomposition level starting from the first level of decomposition. We have observed significant improvement in the classification accuracy up to fourth level of decomposition. At fifth level of decomposition classification accuracy is not improved significantly as compared to the fourth level of decomposition. Hence, we analysed the ECG beats up to fifth level of decomposition.

Weights derived from a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) were applied for feature selection and their moduli used to rank the input features based on their relative importance towards discriminating between physiological and pathological data patterns.

It is usually difficult to gather sufficient ARB data within a project. To overcome the limited availability of training data, several researchers have recently developed cross-project models for ARB prediction. A key point for cross-project models is to learn a good representation for instances in different projects. Nevertheless, most of the previous approaches neither consider the reconstruction property of new representation nor encode source samples' label information in learning representation. To address these shortcomings, we propose a Supervised Representation Learning Approach (SRLA), which is based on double encoding-layer autoencoder, to perform cross-project ARB prediction.

This paper explores a novel distributed in-memory computing architecture where most logic functions are executed within the memory, which significantly alleviates the bandwidth congestion issue and improves the energy efficiency. The proposed distributed in-memory computing architecture is purely built by domain-wall nanowire, i.e., both memory and logic are implemented by domain-wall nanowire devices. As a case study, neural network-based image resolution enhancement algorithm, called DW-NN, is examined within the proposed architecture. We show that all operations involved in machine learning on neural network can be mapped to a logic-in-memory architecture by nonvolatile domain-wall nanowire. Domain-wall nanowire-based logic is customized for in machine learning within image data storage. As such, both neural network training and processing can be performed locally within the memory. The experimental results show that the domain-wall memory can reduce 92% leakage power and 16% dynamic power compared to main memory implemented by DRAM; and domain-wall logic can reduce 31% both dynamic and 65% leakage power under the similar performance compared to CMOS transistor-based logic.

An increase in the ratio of positive to negative training instances was found to greatly influence most of the investigated evaluating parameters of ML methods in simulated virtual screening experiments. In a majority of cases, substantial increases in precision and MCC were observed in conjunction with some decreases in hit recall.

The solution makes use of the depth imagery acquired by the new Kinect 2 sensor that provides more depth resolution. The main novelty is the introduction of a Compressive Sensing step to reduce the dimension of a depth-based feature descriptor, called Depth Spatiograms of Quantized Patterns, which is very discriminative, but also too large for its practical application. The system is composed by three steps: 1) depth-based feature descriptor computation that robustly characterizes the hand gesture; 2) Compressive Sensing based dimensionality reduction that shortens the previous highly discriminative but also large feature vector with almost no information lost; and 3) Support Vector Machine based classification that recognizes the performed hand gestures.

Users follow informal languages in communicating through social media. The language of communication is often mixed in nature, where people transcribe their regional language with English and this technique is found to be extremely popular. Natural language processing (NLP) aims to infer the information from these text where Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging plays an important role in getting the prosody of the written text. For the task of PoS tagging on Code-Mixed Indian Social Media Text, we develop a supervised system based on Conditional Random Field classifier. In order to tackle the problem effectively, we have focused on extracting rich linguistic features. We participate in three different language pairs, ie. English-Hindi, English-Bengali and English-Telugu on three different social media platforms, Twitter, Facebook & WhatsApp. The proposed system is able to successfully assign coarse as well as fine-grained PoS tag labels for a given a code-mixed sentence.

The DKP, which is inspired by the Direct Parallel Perceptron, (Auer et al., 2008), uses a Gaussian kernel and a linear classifier (perceptron). The weight vector of this classifier in the feature space minimizes an error measure which combines the training error and the hyperplane margin, without any tunable regularization parameter. This weight vector can be translated, using a variable change, to the \u03b1-coefficients, and both are determined without iterative calculations. We calculate solutions using several error functions, achieving the best trade-off between accuracy and efficiency with the linear function. These solutions for the \u03b1 coefficients can be considered alternatives to the ELM with a new physical meaning in terms of error and margin: in fact, the linear and quadratic DKP are special cases of the two-class ELM when the regularization parameter C takes the values C=0 and C=\u221e. The linear DKP is extremely efficient and much faster (over a vast collection of 42 benchmark and real-life data sets) than 12 very popular and accurate classifiers including SVM, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Adaboost, Random Forest and Bagging of RPART decision trees, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbors, ELM, Probabilistic Neural Networks, Radial Basis Function neural networks and Generalized ART. Besides, despite its simplicity and extreme efficiency, DKP achieves higher accuracies than 7 out of 12 classifiers, exhibiting small differences with respect to the best ones (SVM, ELM, Adaboost and Random Forest), which are much slower. Thus, the DKP provides an easy and fast way to achieve classification accuracies which are not too far from the best one for a given problem.

Despite its widespread success, the SVM suffers from some important limitations, one of the most significant being that it makes point predictions rather than generating predictive distributions. Recently Tipping (1999) has formulated the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), a probabilistic model whose functional form is equivalent to the SVM. It achieves comparable recognition accuracy to the SVM, yet provides a full predictive distribution, and also requires substantially fewer kernel functions. The original treatment of the RVM relied on the use of type II maximum likelihood (the `evidence framework') to provide point estimates of the hyperparameters which govern model sparsity.

Topsoil (0\u20135 cm) SOC concentrations were surveyed in a coffee agroforestry watershed (0.9 km 2 ) on Andisols in Costa Rica with uniform farm management. We encountered high values and large spatial variations of SOC, from 48.1 to 172 g kg \u2212 1 in the dry combustion set (SOC ref ; n = 72) used for calibrating the visible-near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (VNIRS) samples (SOC VNIRS ; 350\u20132500 nm; n = 520). VNIRS using partial least squares regression was effective in predicting SOC ( R 2 = 0.85; a root mean square error (RMSE) = 12.3 g kg \u2212 1 ) and proved an effective proxy measurement. We assessed several topographic, vegetation and andic soil property variables, of which only the latter (metal\u2013humus complexes and allophanes) displayed strong correlations with SOC ref concentrations. We compared Random Forest and three geostatistical approaches for the interpolation of SOC in unsampled locations. Ordinary kriging with SOC ref yielded an RMSE of 28.0 g kg \u2212 1 . Random Forest was successful in incorporating many weakly and non-linearly correlated covariates with SOC (RMSE = 14.7 g kg \u2212 1 ), provided Al p (the sodium pyrophosphate extractable aluminum), the best predictor of SOC ( r = 0.85) but also the most costly variable to acquire. Co-kriging with Al p also showed high reduction in RMSE (16.0 g kg \u2212 1 ). Co-kriging with SOC VNIRS only showed marginal reduction in RMSE to 24.2 g kg \u2212 1 due to the presence of a high nugget effect. Local variability of SOC in this volcanic agroforestry watershed was dominated by andic properties whereas topographic or vegetation variables had very little impact.

This study also demonstrates the effects of different features and their usefulness in generating an accurate map of Phragmites locations. Accuracy assessment based on a a subset of training/testing samples to show classifier performance and b the entire ground reference GR map to show the quality of mapping is demonstrated. Kappa, overall accuracy OA, class accuracies, and their confidence intervals CIs are reported. An OA of 91% and kappa of 63 is achieved. The results of this study indicate that features such as MAPs are very useful in accurately mapping invasive Phragmites compared with existing region-based approaches.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1080/01431161.2016.1271480", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Remote Sensing", "mag_id": "2567495574", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["22959890", "52154275", "155125521", "104293562", "53226869", "196667557", "33502278"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:132627067"}

The proposed system defines some non-disjoint clusters of highly relevant features with the least inner-redundancy. For each cluster, a neural tree is implemented exploiting an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) together an inference engine in any node. The derived classification rules from ELM are stored in the rule-base of the inference engine to recognize the classes. A majority voting is used to unify the results of the different neural trees. This structure is refereed as the Forest of Extreme Learning Machines with Rule-base Transferring (FELM-RT). The contribution of FELM-RT is to decrease the duplicated computations by using two novel interaction models between the neural trees. In the first interaction model, namely Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model, each node can share its rule-base with the other nodes of the various neural trees. In the second that is referred as Server-to-Client (S2C) model, a neural tree that works on a cluster with the best relevancy and redundancy, shares the rules with the other neural trees. In both of the models, a fuzzy aggregation technique is used to adjust the certainty of the rules. The processing time of FELM-RT decreases essentially and it improves the classification accuracy. The high results of F-measure and G-mean, show that FELM-RT classifies the high-dimensional datasets without over-fitting. The comparison between FELM-RT and some state-of-the-art classifiers reveals that FELM-RT overcomes them specially on the datasets with more than 3 million features.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.eswa.2019.07.003", "venue": "Expert Syst.

The Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index was the most important predictor, being positively associated with fire severity. Evapotranspiration also positively influenced severity, although its importance was conditioned by the data source.

The first method, MIC, applies when predictive models are to be built simultaneously for multiple tasks (``simultaneous transfer'') that share the same set of features. MIC allows each feature to be added to none, some, or all of the task models and is most beneficial for selecting a small set of predictive features from a large pool of features, as is common in genomic and biological datasets. Our second method, TPC (Three Part Coding), uses a similar methodology for the case when the features can be divided into feature classes. Our third method, Transfer-TPC, addresses the ``sequential transfer'' problem in which the task to which we want to transfer knowledge may not be known in advance and may have different amounts of data than the other tasks. Transfer-TPC is most beneficial when we want to transfer knowledge between tasks which have unequal amounts of labeled data, for example the data for disambiguating the senses of different verbs.

Driven by the need for aesthetics and integration in building constructions, new BIPV products are developed, which opens the possibility to extend the usable area to almost any built surface. As a consequence of this, in the new era of BIPV applications, it is only natural that PV is installed on a surface that is regularly shaded. Furthermore, because of the increased capacity, it is expected, that the dependency of future buildings on on-site electricity generation will increase. These factors drive the need for accurate performance monitoring and fault detection methods, of which shade detection of PV applications is an essential element. A new method is developed, that relies on locally measured AC power and regionally measured irradiance data. By calculating the apparent Performance Ratio (aPR) and applying machine-learning algorithms on the measured AC power time series, locally shaded time periods can be identified, without local irradiance measurement. The method consists of 5 steps: Step1. Creating analemma graph of aPR \uf0e0 Step2. Eliminate data points, with cloud-shading. \uf0e0 Step3. Binarizing the remaining measurement points with an aPR-treshold. \uf0e0 Step4. Train Support Vector Machine (SVM) with the previously binarized dataset. \uf0e0 Step5. Use trained SVM to perform a soft-margin nonlinear classification of all data points recorded in the first step. With this method it is possible to distinguish between local and cloud-shading and - in case of a mono-pane installation - to plot the shading contour of the nearby objects, which is useful input for fault detection and monitoring of PV installations in an urban area.

Nonetheless, the anti-representationalist challenge is shown to be both important and progressive insofar as it forces us to see beyond the bare representational/non-representational dichotomy and to recognize instead a rich continuum of degrees and types of representationality.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/BF01063896", "venue": "Synthese", "journal": "Synthese", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1966035729", "mag_field_of_study": ["Philosophy", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["116949230", "125435915", "42196865", "17621549", "207507849", "141374117", "9494028", "170599132", "7069311", "170343102", "29043627", "124246966", "2709975", "1095872", "15485966", "62153173", "56499839", "30165868", "197660420", "56545568", "14498946", "146205620", "21546685", "18118567"], "inbound_citations": ["208297283", "3236576", "149917303", "13180707", "119842250", "43436859", "215453705", "842639", "13846857", "210116943", "195062629", "151627412", "141061250", "17993278", "16972592", "58905910", "10960013", "17750148", "3258552", "4350476", "7452212", "15167074", "144478878", "46978298", "12621450", "15549780", "62786692", "3205630", "147321722", "12340703", "54493439", "197866944", "17953383", "9513494", "170592680", "33690787", "149119565", "206065207", "17964850", "121063163", "199400753", "147836816", "176242880", "7743034", "1755230", "18683254", "144785966", "123482637", "38362843", "20062343", "12229565", "33929996", "78089851", "54511197", "143533881", "102486183", "55993264", "18194442", "215068238", "55006673", "14890114", "50053436", "2636168", "102484778", "56438524", "14770148", "120503548", "15349230", "31134320", "1162168", "16942215", "214725627", "595786", "16990972", "17672891", "15440349", "215596887", "14863125", "195808368", "46957959", "17530627", "214997387"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17136030"}

To address this issue, our main contribution in this paper is to propose an effective approach to learn a low dimensional gaze representation without gaze annotations, which to the best of our best knowledge, is the first work to do so. The main idea is to rely on a gaze redirection network and use the gaze representation difference of the input and target images (of the redirection network) as the redirection variable. A redirection loss in image domain allows the joint training of both the redirection network and the gaze representation network. In addition, we propose a warping field regularization which not only provides an explicit physical meaning to the gaze representations but also avoids redirection distortions. Promising results on few-shot gaze estimation (competitive results can be achieved with as few as <=100 calibration samples), cross-dataset gaze estimation, gaze network pretraining, and another task (head pose estimation) demonstrate the validity of our framework.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1911.06939", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2987661509", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16976956", "203904878", "152282920", "52967476", "51866262", "207914801", "12528622", "396361", "78414", "6974958", "7351664", "148571665", "3927563", "32155474", "16489508", "6851753", "109740466", "6099034", "980236", "52059049", "206768600", "898079", "195499789", "152282503", "52291364", "14950708", "13976049", "17955393", "146121028", "286832", "9531279", "8229065", "10505366", "16104238", "15500329", "1118547", "11305396", "11611523", "206895517", "11987969", "52228617", "6096277", "26302", "43150931", "15413642", "198917989", "53542201", "109936956", "5040430", "11896746", "1180324", "20747508"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208138568"}

While deep transfer learning can usually boost the performance with better accuracy and faster convergence, transferring weights from inappropriate networks hurts training procedure and may lead to even lower accuracy. In this paper, we consider deep transfer learning as minimizing a linear combination of empirical loss and regularizer based on pre-trained weights, where the regularizer would restrict the training procedure from lowering the empirical loss, with conflicted descent directions (e.g., derivatives). Following the view, we propose a novel strategy making regularization-based Deep Transfer learning Never Hurt (DTNH) that, for each iteration of training procedure, computes the derivatives of the two terms separately, then re-estimates a new descent direction that does not hurt the empirical loss minimization while preserving the regularization affects from the pre-trained weights. Extensive experiments have been done using common transfer learning regularizers, such as L2-SP and knowledge distillation, on top of a wide range of deep transfer learning benchmarks including Caltech, MIT indoor 67, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. The empirical results show that the proposed descent direction estimation strategy DTNH can always improve the performance of deep transfer learning tasks based on all above regularizers, even when transferring pre-trained weights from inappropriate networks. All in all, DTNH strategy can improve state-of-the-art regularizers in all cases with 0.1%--7% higher accuracy in all experiments.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1911.07489", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICDM.2019.00068", "venue": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)", "journal": "2019 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3003448987,2988133370", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["4728838", "43993788", "206597351", "6161478", "3698230", "118828957", "206594692", "7200347", "7824159", "8197602", "4704285", "3603048", "47259365", "29150626", "37308416", "17195923", "15193013", "740063", "7910040", "2723173", "597779", "10940950", "3761015", "1055111", "8849206", "206596723", "362467", "829159", "13754818", "2608922"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208139528"}

For musical instrument classification, it is verified that the pitch-frequency cepstral coefficients (PFCCs) as short-term features are better than the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). We select the PFCCs and the partials amplitudes as short-term feature to generate note features by integration models respectively.

Typically, the bit rate of an MP3 file is used as a relative measure of audio quality, however, this check fails if the audio has been transcoded from a lower bit rate to a higher bit rate. In this paper, we propose a method of detecting the original lower bit rate of a given audio file by analyzing its high frequency spectrum. Using a Support Vector Machine classifier and five classes of bit rates (CBR 128 kbps, 192 kbps, 256 kbps, 320 kbps, and VBR-0), our algorithm returned an average success rate of 97% in correctly detecting the original compressed bit rate of an audio file in the absence of any coding format knowledge other than the audio signal itself. Furthermore, our algorithm also detected the original lower bit rates of 320 kbps MP3s transcoded from 128 kbps and 192 kbps sources with a success rate of 99%.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/1597817.1597828", "venue": "MM&Sec '09", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1986494988", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15084593", "15008707", "2397805", "14878605", "2443126"], "inbound_citations": ["12561403", "10545745", "20733046", "62840917", "2811928", "6870398", "52876720", "14515488", "19799738", "912904", "24193397", "45756899", "52085101"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11473284"}

Early diagnosis process significantly affects follow-up of the disease. As in other diseases, it is important to classify the data in cancer cases to determine whether the person belongs to healthy-patient or high-low risk groups. For this purpose, machine learning based on artificial intelligence can be used as a very effective method to follow both the progress and the treatment response process of such diseases and to reveal important features of data sets. In this publication, breast cancer diagnosis was carried out using Principal Component Analysis-Support Vector Machine (PCA-SVM) and proposed parallel Principal Component Analysis-Linear Discriminant Analysis-Support Vector Machine (PCA-LDA-SVM) model classifier algorithms, by LabVIEW. LabVIEW, known as Virtual Instrument (VI), is a graphical programming language. The durableness of the used algorithms is analyzed using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, rand index, False Positive Rate (FPR), False Discovery Rate (FDR), False Negative Rate (FNR), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) parameters and status detection. The obtained results are compared with each other. After training, of the 140 data used in the test set, 130 were used for the test performance analysis and 10 data were used for the status determination of the newly entered data. Performance analysis has been examined for Polynomial and Gaussian kernel functions. The proposed parallel model provides improvement especially for the Polynomial kernel function.

They can be significant yield detractors as a consequence of occupying substantial die area, creating placement and routing blockages, and having stringent Vccmin and power integrity requirements. Achieving timing-correctness for embedded memories in advanced nodes is costly (e.g., closing the design at multiple (logic-memory) cross-corners). Further, multiphysics (e.g., crosstalk, IR, etc.) signoff analyses make early understanding and prediction of timing (-correctness) even more difficult. With long tool and design closure subflow runtimes, design teams need improved prediction of embedded memory timing failures, as early as possible in the implementation flow. In this work, we propose a learning-based methodology to perform early prediction of timing failure risk given only the netlist, timing constraints, and floorplan context (wherein the memories have been placed). Our contributions include (i) identification of relevant netlist and floorplan parameters, (ii) the avoidance of long P&R tool runtimes (up to a week or even more) with early prediction, and (iii) a new implementation of Boosting with Support Vector Machine regression with focus on negative-slack outcomes through weighting in the model construction.

The aim of this thesis was to study two relevant properties of photonic delay systems with direct applications in current information processing and encryption systems: consistency and unpredictability. We characterized the ability of laser systems with delay to exhibit, on the one hand, reliable complex dynamics when an external stimulus is applied, and on the other hand, unpredictable complex behavior, depending on the operating conditions. Consistency properties have been studied as a necessary condition for the implementation of Reservoir Computing schemes. The property of unpredictability has been exploited in the application of random bit generation. ::: - Contens : For the characterization of the consistency properties, we used three different experiments based on a semiconductor laser systems with delay that followed the drive-response scheme. Through the analysis of the responses to a repeated drive, a consistent or inconsistent behavior can be identified. ::: In the first setup, we investigated consistency of a semiconductor laser to its own time-delayed feedback, so that the drive was the self-generated complex signal, and the response system was the semiconductor laser itself. A high accuracy in the repetition of the drive was achieved with the design of a fiber-optic setup with two feedback loops. This allowed us the extraction of measures like the sub-Lyapunov exponent. ::: We extended the study to the use of a semiconductor laser system with excitability properties subject to electrical input pulse trains. Here, two different pulse trains modulating the pump current of the laser were used as drives, while the semiconductor laser with delayed feedback operating in the chaotic regime of Low Frequency Fluctuations acted as response system. The purpose of this experiment was to study the possibility and requirements to induce a consistent response, particularly the power drop-out, with the injection of a short pulse. ::: To complement the investigations on consistency, the last drive-response scheme used was an electro-optic intensity oscillator driven by 3 scalar signals: an harmonic waveform, a sequence of pulses, and recorded time-traces from the autonomous dynamics. Under certain conditions, the response system can show hysteresis and coexistence of multistable states. ::: We introduced new tools to quantify consistency and identified common features of the setups investigated. Our study showed that when the autonomous dynamics were periodic or period doubled, a consistent response was obtained independent of the drive. In cases of bistable dynamics, new sorts of consistency were discovered, like reproducible time-position transitions between the two states. ::: The last Chapter of this thesis was devoted to the use of the unpredictable dynamics for the generation of random bits. A semiconductor laser with polarization rotated feedback was utilized to provide chaos characterized by randomness-like features, including a flat broad spectrum, suppression of the delay echoes of the autocorrelation function and no recurrences in the temporal oscillations. Nevertheless, we found that other factors like the data acquisition and the postprocessing of the signal also affected the randomness of the finally generated bits. The validity of our guidelines was proven with our random bit generator, enhancing its generation rate up to 160Gbit/s. ::: - Conclus : With this work, we explored the emerging complex behavior in laser systems with delay. In particular, we characterized their ability to display a consistent behavior, and deterministic chaos that can lead to unpredictable dynamics. We introduced new tools and measures to quantify consistency, and guidelines for an optimum performance of a random bit generator. Altogether, our results represent a significant contribution to the areas where these two properties play a role, such as information processing and secure optical communications.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2731496749", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:195943725"}

It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes. A Data mining technique is employed for overcoming the hurdles for the prediction of hourly rental bike demand. This paper discusses the models for hourly rental bike demand prediction. Data used include weather information (Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, Visibility, Dewpoint, Solar radiation, Snowfall, Rainfall), the number of bikes rented per hour and date information. The paper also explores an filtering of features approach to eliminate the parameters which are not predictive and ranks the features based on its prediction performance.

Tertiary institutions thus have a common interest in identifying students at risk of failing or dropping out. Previous research studies have identified factors that influence success/failure which include, but are not limited to, the students' personal information, academic background and social environment. This study aims to use the emerging field of Educational Data Mining as a preventative measure rather than reiterate factors that influence success. The first year student data collected and stored in the School of Computer Science at the University of the Witwatersrand has been utilised in this study. The study used the students' first semester/midyear mark to predict success/failure at the end of the academic year. This will assist in identifying students at risk of failing and could assist with early intervention. A modified version of the CRISP-DM methodology was used. The investigation was broken down into two phases: training and test phase. In the training phase, student data from the years 2009 to 2011 were modelled using the WEKA Explorer GUI. Three classifiers: J48 classifier, Naive Bayes and Decision Table, were used for modelling and were also compared. Using both the run information from WEKA and performance metrics, the J48 classifier was shown to be the better performing algorithm in the training phase. This algorithm was then integrated into the back-end of the Success Or Failure Determiner (SOFD) tool, which was created specifically for this study. In the test phase 92% of the instances were predicted correctly. Furthermore 23 of the 25 students who failed were flagged. The research findings indicated that the midyear mark can be considered as a factor which correctly predicts the Computer Science I final year marks. After further investigation with larger sample sizes, the tool can be used practically in the school of Computer Science to identify students at risk of failing.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-03844-5_54", "venue": "MIKE", "journal": null, "mag_id": "643963716", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["204247450", "111383032", "3228239", "21695910", "57646610"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:46532733"}

In brief, the original COSP is divided into a more stable constitutive series using discrete wavelet transform (DWT). These respective sub-series are then forecasted using ARIMA and LSSVM combination method and lastly, all forecasted components are combined back together to acquire the original forecasted series. The datasets consist of monthly COSP series from West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent North Sea (Brent). To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, several comparisons are made with the single forecasting approaches, a hybrid forecasting approach and also some existing forecasting approaches that utilize COSP series as the dataset by comparing the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) acquired. From the results, the proposed approach has managed to outperform the other approaches with smaller MAE and RMSE values which signify better forecasting accuracy.

Given the limited resources available, and that vector control is the key approach for prevention in Singapore, it is important that public health professionals know where resources should be invested in. This study aims to stratify the spatial risk of dengue transmission in Singapore for effective deployment of resources. ::: ::: ::: Methodology/principal findings ::: Random Forest was used to predict the risk rank of dengue transmission in 1km2 grids, with dengue, population, entomological and environmental data. The predicted risk ranks are categorized and mapped to four color-coded risk groups for easy operation application. The risk maps were evaluated with dengue case and cluster data. Risk maps produced by Random Forest have high accuracy. More than 80% of the observed risk ranks fell within the 80% prediction interval. The observed and predicted risk ranks were highly correlated (\u22650.86, P <0.01). Furthermore, the predicted risk levels were in excellent agreement with case density, a weighted Kappa coefficient of more than 0.80 (P <0.01). Close to 90% of the dengue clusters occur in high risk areas, and the odds of cluster forming in high risk areas were higher than in low risk areas. ::: ::: ::: Conclusions ::: This study demonstrates the potential of Random Forest and its strong predictive capability in stratifying the spatial risk of dengue transmission in Singapore.

Generally, a specially designed projection and reconstruction transfer functions bridging multiple domains for heterogeneous knowledge sharing are wanted. However, we argue that the existing subspace reconstruction based domain adaptation algorithms neglect the class prior, such that the learned transfer function is biased, especially when data scarcity of some class is encountered. Different from those previous methods, in this article, we propose a novel class-wise reconstruction-based adaptation method called Class-specific Reconstruction Transfer Learning (CRTL), which optimizes a well modeled transfer loss function by fully exploiting intra-class dependency and inter-class independency. The merits of the CRTL are three-fold. 1) Using a class-specific reconstruction matrix to align the source domain with the target domain fully exploits the class prior in modeling the domain distribution consistency, which benefits the cross-domain classification. 2) Furthermore, to keep the intrinsic relationship between data and labels after feature augmentation, a projected Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (pHSIC), that measures the dependency between data and label, is first proposed in transfer learning community by mapping the data from raw space to RKHS. 3) In addition, by imposing low-rank and sparse constraints on the class-specific reconstruction coefficient matrix, the global and local data structure that contributes to domain correlation can be effectively preserved. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art representation-based domain adaptation methods.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper achieving provable results regarding FHP. We provide both lower and upper bounds to this NP-hard problem. First, we give a simple randomized algorithm whose running time is n O(1= 2 ) where is the optimal separation margin.

When learning large hypergraphs, converting them to graphs to employ the distributed graph frameworks is a common approach, yet it results in major efficiency drawbacks including an inflated problem size, the excessive replicas, and the unbalanced workloads. To avoid such drawbacks, we take a different approach and propose HyperX, which is a thin layer built upon Spark. To preserve the problem size, HyperX directly operates on a distributed hypergraph. To reduce the replicas, HyperX replicates the vertices but not the hyperedges. To balance the workloads, we investigate the hypergraph partitioning problem aiming at minimizing the space and the communication cost subject to two separate constraints on the hyperedge and the vertex workloads.

Here we use the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) integrated with a recurrent model for this purpose. Long short-term memory blocks are used as hidden units. Also, the CNN-derived features are employed in a recurrent model with a CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) layer to get the output.

Background and objectivesThe present study proposes an intelligent system for automatic categorization of Pap smear images to detect cervical dysplasia, which has been an open problem ongoing for last five decades. MethodsThe classification technique is based on shape, texture and color features. It classifies the cervical dysplasia into two-level (normal and abnormal) and three-level (Negative for Intraepithelial Lesion or Malignancy, Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion and High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion) classes reflecting the established Bethesda system of classification used for diagnosis of cancerous or precancerous lesion of cervix. The system is evaluated on two generated databases obtained from two diagnostic centers, one containing 1610 single cervical cells and the other 1320 complete smear level images. The main objective of this database generation is to categorize the images according to the Bethesda system of classification both of which require lots of training and expertise. The system is also trained and tested on the benchmark Herlev University database which is publicly available. In this contribution a new segmentation technique has also been proposed for extracting shape features. Ripplet Type I transform, Histogram first order statistics and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix have been used for color and texture features respectively. To improve classification results, ensemble method is used, which integrates the decision of three classifiers. Assessments are performed using 5 fold cross validation. ResultsExtended experiments reveal that the proposed system can successfully classify Pap smear images performing significantly better when compared with other existing methods.

Over the last few decades several antibacterial peptides have successfully approved as drug by FDA, which has prompted an interest in these antibacterial peptides. In our recent study we analyzed 999 antibacterial peptides, which were collected from Antibacterial Peptide Database (APD). We have also developed methods to predict and classify these antibacterial peptides using Support Vector Machine (SVM).ResultsDuring analysis we observed that certain residues are preferred over other in antibacterial peptide, particularly at the N and C terminus. These observation and increased data of antibacterial peptide in APD encouraged us to again develop a new and more robust method for predicting antibacterial peptides in protein from their amino acid sequence or given peptide have antibacterial properties or not. First, the binary patterns of the 15 N terminus residues were used for predicting antibacterial peptide using SVM and achieved accuracy of 85.46% with 0.705 Mathew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Then we used the binary pattern of 15 C terminus residues and achieved accuracy of 85.05% with 0.701 MCC, latter on we developed prediction method by combining N & C terminus and achieved an accuracy of 91.64% with 0.831 MCC. Finally we developed SVM based model using amino acid composition of whole peptide and achieved 92.14% accuracy with MCC 0.843. In this study we used five-fold cross validation technique to develop all these models and tested the performance of these models on an independent dataset. We further classify antibacterial peptides according to their sources and achieved an overall accuracy of 98.95%. We further classify antibacterial peptides in their respective family and got a satisfactory result.ConclusionAmong antibacterial peptides, there is preference for certain residues at N and C terminus, which helps to discriminate them from non-antibacterial peptides. Amino acid composition of antibacterial peptides helps to demarcate them from non-antibacterial peptide and their further classification in source and family. Antibp2 will be helpful in discovering efficacious antibacterial peptide, which we hope will be helpful against antibiotics resistant bacteria.

Though IoT devices are vulnerable to both hardware and software malware attacks, the impact of hardware vulnerabilities will be significant since the devices once fabricated cannot be modified or updated. Among the major hardware vulnerabilities, hardware malware also known as hardware trojan (HT) is critical as it can control, modify, disable or monitor the key information in the device. While many techniques have been explored in the literature to detect HT at the gate level netlist, their computational complexity is very high and detection accuracy is relatively low. In order to reduce the computational complexity and improve the detection accuracy, a novel approach is proposed in this work to detect HT in the gate level netlist using Hamming weight model and unsupervised anomaly based detection method. The leakage power supply current signatures for both HT-free and HT-infected circuits are derived from Hamming weights of the random input sequence. The current signatures are then normalized and applied to one class support vector machine which acts as an anomaly detector to identify the HT-infected circuits. The process parameter and environmental noise variations are considered while characterizing the gates for different Hamming weights.

The salvage treatment decision is usually made dynamically based on the patient's evolving history of disease status and other time-dependent clinical covariates. A multi-center prostate cancer observational study has provided us data on longitudinal prostate specific antigen (PSA) measurements, time-varying salvage treatment, and cancer recurrence time. These data enable us to estimate the best dynamic regime of salvage treatment, while accounting for the complicated confounding of time-varying covariates present in the data. A Random Forest based method is used to model the probability of regime adherence and inverse probability weights are used to account for the complexity of selection bias in regime adherence. The optimal regime is then identified by the largest restricted mean survival time. We conduct simulation studies with different PSA trends to mimic both simple and complex regime adherence mechanisms. The proposed method can efficiently accommodate complex and possibly unknown adherence mechanisms, and it is robust to cases where the proportional hazards assumption is violated. We apply the method to data collected from the observational study and estimate the best salvage treatment regime in managing the risk of prostate cancer recurrence.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5466876", "pubmed_id": "27893926", "doi": "10.1111/biom.12621", "venue": "Biometrics", "journal": "Biometrics", "mag_id": "2558050804", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["58570506", "206499399", "198985649"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3600237"}

Different types of social ties have essentially different influences on people. Awareness of the types of social ties can benefit many applications, such as recommendation and community detection. For example, our close friends tend to move in the same circles that we do, while our classmates may be distributed into different communities. Though a bulk of research has focused on inferring particular types of relationships in a specific social network, few publications systematically study the generalization of the problem of predicting social ties across multiple heterogeneous networks. In this work, we develop a framework referred to as TranFG for classifying the type of social relationships by learning across heterogeneous networks. The framework incorporates social theories into a factor graph model, which effectively improves the accuracy of predicting the types of social relationships in a target network by borrowing knowledge from a different source network. We also present several active learning strategies to further enhance the inferring performance. To scale up the model to handle really large networks, we design a distributed learning algorithm for the proposed model. We evaluate the proposed framework (TranFG) on six different networks and compare with several existing methods. TranFG clearly outperforms the existing methods on multiple metrics. For example, by leveraging information from a coauthor network with labeled advisor-advisee relationships, TranFG is able to obtain an F1-score of 90p (8p--28p improvements over alternative methods) for predicting manager-subordinate relationships in an enterprise email network.

Therefore, the study of protein function can be facilitated by predictions of protein location. Protein location can be predicted either from the sequence of a protein alone by identification of targeting peptide sequences and motifs, or by homology to proteins of known location. A third approach, which is complementary, exploits the differences in amino acid composition of proteins associated to different cellular locations, and can be useful if motif and homology information are missing. Here we expand this approach taking into account amino acid composition at different levels of amino acid exposure. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Our method has two stages. For stage one, we trained multiple Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to score eukaryotic protein sequences for membership to each of three categories: nuclear, cytoplasmic and extracellular, plus extra category nucleocytoplasmic, accounting for the fact that a large number of proteins shuttles between those two locations. In stage two we use an artificial neural network (ANN) to propose a category from the scores given to the four locations in stage one. The method reaches an accuracy of 68% when using as input 3D-derived values of amino acid exposure. Calibration of the method using predicted values of amino acid exposure allows classifying proteins without 3D-information with an accuracy of 62% and discerning proteins in different locations even if they shared high levels of identity. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: In this study we explored the relationship between residue exposure and protein subcellular location.

Randomization-based techniques for classifier ensemble construction, like Bagging and Random Forests, are well known and widely used. They consist of independently training the ensemble members on random perturbations of the training data or random changes of the learning algorithm. We argue that randomization techniques can be defined also by directly manipulating the parameters of the base classifier, i.e., by sampling their values from a given probability distribution. A classifier ensemble can thus be built without manipulating the training data or the learning algorithm, and then running the learning algorithm to obtain the individual classifiers. The key issue is to define a suitable parameter distribution for a given base classifier. This also allows one to re-implement existing randomization techniques by sampling the classifier parameters from the distribution implicitly defined by such techniques, if it is known or can be approximated, instead of explicitly manipulating the training data and running the learning algorithm. In this work we provide a first investigation of our approach, starting from an existing randomization technique (Bagging): we analytically approximate the parameter distribution for three well-known classifiers (nearest-mean, linear and quadratic discriminant), and empirically show that it generates ensembles very similar to Bagging.

The former identifies and filters out unobserved frames, and the latter fills up the filtered parts by retrieving coherent alternatives from training data. Hidden Conditional Random Fields (HCRFs) are then used to recognize the filtered and completed actions.

The proposed algorithm first partitions the training data into several pair-wise disjoint clusters. Then, the representatives of these clusters are used to train an initial support vector machine, based on which we can approximately identify the support vectors and non-support vectors. After replacing the cluster containing only non-support vectors with its representative, the number of training data can be significantly reduced, thereby speeding up the training process. The proposed ClusterSVM has been tested against the popular training algorithm SMO on both the artificial data and the real data, and a significant speedup was observed.

Identifying unknown drug interactions is of great benefit in the early detection of adverse drug reactions. Despite existence of several resources for drug-drug interaction (DDI) information, the wealth of such information is buried in a body of unstructured medical text which is growing exponentially. This calls for developing text mining techniques for identifying DDIs. The state-of-the-art DDI extraction methods use Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with non-linear composite kernels to explore diverse contexts in literature. While computationally less expensive, linear kernel-based systems have not achieved a comparable performance in DDI extraction tasks. In this work, we propose an efficient and scalable system using a linear kernel to identify DDI information. The proposed approach consists of two steps: identifying DDIs and assigning one of four different DDI types to the predicted drug pairs. We demonstrate that when equipped with a rich set of lexical and syntactic features, a linear SVM classifier is able to achieve a competitive performance in detecting DDIs. In addition, the one-against-one strategy proves vital for addressing an imbalance issue in DDI type classification.

This paper focuses on the application of an ensemble classification approach based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for PMDR problem. The proposal method comprises four stages: (1) the pedestrian moving direction dataset generation, (2) the online data augmentation process, (3) the single CNN models and (4) the ensemble CNN models. Firstly, in order to obtain considerable number of features which fit the proposal problems, an original pedestrian dataset is produced. Afterwards, five single CNN models, as initial single strong classifiers, are built based on Cross-Validation. And the proposal online data augmentation is used during training process. Finally, the tuned single CNN models form ensemble CNN models by the proposal ensemble strategy and then, the best ensemble CNN model is selected for their performance evaluation. This paper highlights how ensemble learning technique like Averaging can dramatically improves the performance of a CNN based classification system.

Filtering and feature selection can have large impact on classifier accuracy and area under the curve (AUC), as noisy data can confuse classifier and lead it to catch wrong patterns in training data. The common approach in data filtering is using proximity graphs. However, the problem of the optimal filtering parameters selection is still insufficiently researched. In this paper filtering procedure based on k-nearest neighbours proximity graph was used. Filtering parameters selection was adopted as the solution of outlier minimization problem: k-NN proximity graph, power of distance and threshold parameters are selected in order to minimize outlier percentage in training data. Then performance of six commonly used classifiers (Logistic Regression, Na\u00efve Bayes, Neural Network, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree) and one heterogeneous classifiers combiner (DES-LA) are compared with and without filtering. Dynamic ensemble selection (DES) systems work by estimating the level of competence of each classifier from a pool of classifiers. Only the most competent ones are selected to classify a given test sample. This is achieved by defining a criterion to measure the level of competence of base classifiers, such as, its accuracy in local regions of the feature space around the query instance. In our case the combiner is based on the local accuracy of single classifiers and its output is a linear combination of single classifiers ranking. As results of filtering, accuracy of DES-LA combiner shows big increase for low-accuracy datasets. But filtering doesn\u2019t have sufficient impact on DES-LA performance while working with high-accuracy datasets. The results are discussed, and classifiers, which performance was highly affected by pre-processing filtering step, are defined. The main contribution of the paper is introducing modifications to the DES-LA combiner, as well as comparative analysis of filtering impact on the classifiers of various type.

Thetraining algorithms findthe hyperplane bymaximizing themargin whichisdefined as theminimal distance between ahyperplane andthedata.

AnSVM isordinarily usedasabinary classifier that separates aspace into twoareas byaseparating hyperplane. Theseparating hyperplane isnotexplicitly given. Itis represented bythecombination ofabunch ofdata whichare called thesupport vectors (SVs). Meanwhile, thereal data are often notlinearly separable intheinput space. Toovercome this, data aremapped into ahigh dimensional feature space, inwhich thedata aresparse andpossibly moreseparable. In practice, themapping isalso notexplicitly given. Instead, a kernel function isincorporated tosimplify thecomputation of theinner product value ofthetransformed data inthefeature space. Thatis, choosing akernel function implies defining themapping fromtheinput space tothefeature space.

New empirical work is presented showing dissociations between implicit and explicit memory performance. Recently proposed explanations for such data lead to a new connectionist learning procedure: CALM (Categorizing and Learning Module), which can learn with or without supervision, and shows practical advantages over many existing procedures. Specific experiments are simulated by a network model (ELAN) composed of CALM modules. A working memory extension to the model is also discussed that could give it symbol manipulation abilities.

In this work, an attitude monitoring approach is proposed to diagnose the fault of the delta 3D printer using support vector machines (SVM). An attitude sensor was mounted on the moving platform of the printer to monitor its 3-axial attitude angle, angular velocity, vibratory acceleration and magnetic field intensity. The attitude data of the working printer were collected under different conditions involving 12 fault types and a normal condition. The collected data were analyzed for diagnosing the health condition. To this end, the combination of binary classification, one-against-one with least-square SVM, was adopted for fault diagnosis modelling by using all channels of attitude monitoring data in the experiment. For comparison, each one channel of the attitude monitoring data was employed for model training and testing. On the other hand, a back propagation neural network (BPNN) was also applied to diagnose fault using the same data. The best fault diagnosis accuracy (94.44%) was obtained when all channels of the attitude monitoring data were used with SVM modelling.

Current PD therapies are based on dopamine replacement, and given that bradykinesia is the symptom that best correlates with the dopaminergic deficiency, the knowledge of its fluctuations may be useful in the diagnosis, treatment and better understanding of the disease progression. This paper evaluates a machine learning method that analyses the signals provided by a triaxial accelerometer placed on the waist of PD patients in order to automatically assess bradykinetic gait unobtrusively. This method employs Support Vector Machines to determine those parts of the signals corresponding to gait. The frequency content of strides is then used to determine bradykinetic walking bouts and to estimate bradykinesia severity based on an epsilon-Support Vector Regression model. The method is validated in 12 PD patients, which leads to two main conclusions. Firstly, the frequency content of the strides allows for the dichotomic detection of bradykinesia with an accuracy higher than 90%. This process requires the use of a patient-dependant threshold that is estimated based on a leave-one-patient-out regression model. Secondly, bradykinesia severity measured through UPDRS scores is approximated by means of a regression model with errors below 10%. Although the method has to be further validated in more patients, results obtained suggest that the presented approach can be successfully used to rate bradykinesia in the daily life of PD patients unobtrusively. A method is proposed to detect and rate bradykinetic gait in an unobtrusive way.A waist-worn triaxial accelerometer, SVM and strides' frequency content are employed.Detection accuracy based on a leave-one-patient-out (LOPO) evaluation is 92%.Severity estimation error through LOPO is ~10%.Results suggest the method can unobtrusively rate bradykinesia in patients' daily life.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28351715", "doi": "10.1016/j.compbiomed.2017.03.020", "venue": "Computers in biology and medicine", "journal": "Computers in biology and medicine", "mag_id": "2604019843", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["69764126", "13873860", "160009635", "208185620", "85532003", "208498573", "52911150", "5077977", "207888303", "202580754", "27853133", "215238884", "20536920", "53084293", "92993964", "195878738"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:206916496"}

Then, faults were simulated in normal data to get 100 samples of each fault, in which one sample is composed of 1000 data elements. A support vector machine (SVM) was used for data classification in a one-versus-rest manner. The statistical time-domain features, extracted from a sample, were used as a single observation for training and testing SVM. The number of features varied from 5 to 10 to examine the effect on accuracy of SVM. Three different kernel functions used to train SVM include linear, polynomial, and radial-basis function kernels. The fault occurrence event in fault samples was chosen randomly in some cases to replicate a practical scenario in industrial systems. The results show that an increase in the number of features from 5 to 10 hardly increases the total accuracy of the classifier. However, using ten features gives the highest accuracy for fault classification in an SVM. An increase in the number of training samples from 40 to 60 caused an overfitting problem. The $k$ -fold cross-validation technique was adopted to overcome this issue. The increase in number of data elements per sample to 2500 increases the efficiency of the classifier.

{"paper_id": "6762339", "title": "Editorial: Neural plasticity for rich and uncertain robotic information streams", "authors": [{"first": "Andrea", "middle": [], "last": "Soltoggio", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Frank", "middle": ["van", "der"], "last": "Velde", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Models of adaptation and neural plasticity are often demonstrated in robotic scenarios with heavily pre-processed and regulated information streams to provide learning algorithms with appropriate, well timed, and meaningful data to match the assumptions of learning rules. On the contrary, natural scenarios are often rich of raw, asynchronous, overlapping and uncertain inputs and outputs whose relationships and meaning are progressively acquired, disambiguated, and used for further learning. Therefore, recent research efforts focus on neural embodied systems that rely less on well timed and pre-processed inputs, but rather extract autonomously relationships and features in time and space. The bio-inspired focus does not seek the most effective machine learning method to solve those problems, it rather points toward a better understanding of problem solving mechanisms in neural systems, which can in turn also provide viable solutions to difficult problems. ::: ::: Realistic models of plasticity must account for delayed rewards (Soltoggio et al., 2013a), noisy and ambiguous data (Soltoggio et al., 2013b), and emerging and novel input features during online and value learning (Krichmar and Rohrbein, 2013). Those factors have indeed been an emerging focus of search (e.g., Sporns and Alexander, 2003; Lungarella and Sporns, 2006; Martius et al., 2013), with a growing number of studies that cannot be reviewed in this short editorial. Such approaches model the progressive acquisition of knowledge by neural systems through experience in environments that may be affected by ambiguities, uncertain signals, delays, or novel features (Pugh et al., 2014; Soltoggio, 2015). This Research Topic in Frontiers in Neurorobotics explored fundamental properties and dynamics of neural learning systems that are naturally immersed in a rich information flow. We are pleased with the contributions collected in this Research Topic, each of which addresses key topics in this emerging and important field of research. ::: ::: One overarching problem in this field is that of making sense of large amounts of data from sensory systems in order to recognize particular situations and perform basic tasks. Parisi and colleagues took a self-organizing neural approach to action recognition using human pose-motion features. The Growing When Required (GWR) networks manifest a high-level structural plasticity that regulates network complexity in relation to the task (Parisi et al., 2015). Such a bio-inspired approach recorded state-of-the-art performance on a dataset of full-body actions captured with a depth sensor, with competitive results in a public benchmark of domestic daily actions. ::: ::: Another source of large, noisy and uncertain data is found in robotic tactile sensors. Chou et al. (2015) deployed a specific robot called CARL-SJR with a full-body tactile sensory area. CARL-SJR encourages people to communicate with it through gentle touch, and provides feedback to users by displaying bright colors on its surface. The time-delayed and uncertain nature of the interactions poses challenges to the formation of correct associations between stimuli, rewards and actions. The approach devised by Chou et al. (2015) experiments with a strongly bio-inspired architecture of spiking neurons with neuromodulated plasticity. The model abstracts brain areas such as the primary somatosensory cortex, prefrontal cortex, striatum, and the insular cortex to process noisy data generated directly from CARL-SJR's tactile sensory area. The result is a robust learning mechanism that reliably forms correct associations and preferences for directions without heavily pre-processed inputs. ::: ::: Uncertainty and large amount of data are also found in collaborative multi-robot scenarios in which multiple robots work alongside humans. Galbraith and colleagues propose a motor babbling approach to learn a complex set of relations and interactions with the 11-degrees-of-freedom RoPro Calliope mobile robot (Galbraith et al., 2015). Motor babbling of its wheels and arm enabled the Calliope to learn how to relate visual and proprioceptive information to achieve hand-eye-body coordination. ::: ::: Motor control is a problem in which neural plasticity results in high level of adaptation, adjusting neural systems to operate in combination with specific bio-mechanical structures and morphologies. (Burms et al., 2015) demonstrated the utility of modulated Hebbian plasticity in embodied computation for compliant robotics. In such scenarios, control policies are generally unknown due to the partial offload of control policies to morphological computation. Modulated Hebbian plasticity was shown to lead to hybrid controllers that naturally integrate the computations that are performed by the robot's body into a neural network architecture. Those results demonstrate the potential of universal applicability of plasticity rules to complex control problems. ::: ::: A similar problem was tackled in Dasgupta et al. (2015) in which they used distributed recurrent neural networks with synaptic adaptation to find a range of complex behaviors for walking robots. In particular, their approach demonstrated a remarkable flexibility in designing control systems that can work with multi-legged robots. A Central Pattern Generator is used to feed a self-adaptive reservoir network, which in turn provides motor control through a read-out integration unit. These results contribute to demonstrate the efficacy and continuous advancement of plastic neural models in complex input-output control scenarios. ::: ::: The overall vision provided by these research papers outlines an increasingly more effective deployment of plastic neural models to tackle complex perception and control problems in which noise, uncertainty and delays pose a challenge to many algorithms. This vision matches the intuition of bioinspired neurorobotics approaches that propose advanced, plastic neural systems as viable models when sensory-motor information flows approach the richness and complexity found in the behavior of biological systems.

A novel fault diagnosis method based on the Ensemble Multi-Fault Features Indexing (EMFFI) approach is proposed for the condition monitoring of gearboxes. Different from traditional methods of signal analysis in the one-dimensional space, this study employs a supervised learning method to determine the faults of a gearbox in a two-dimensional space using the classification model established by training the features extracted automatically from diagnostic vibration signals captured. The proposed method mainly includes the following steps. First, the vibration signals are transformed into a bi-spectrum contour map utilizing bi-spectrum technology, which provides a basis for the following image-based feature extraction. Then, Speeded-Up Robustness Feature (SURF) is applied to automatically extract the image feature points of the bi-spectrum contour map using a multi-fault features indexing theory, and the feature dimension is reduced by Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Finally, Random Forest (RF) is introduced to identify the fault types of the gearbox.

For feature extraction, an explicit guided filter is proposed to extract the eight block-based directional features from the high-quality finger vein contours obtained from noisy, non-uniform, low-contrast finger vein images without introducing any segmentation process. An FC-ELMs consist of eight single ELMs, each trained with a block feature with a pre-defined direction to enhance the robustness against variation of the finger vein images, and an output layer to combine the outputs of the eight ELMs. For the structured training of the vein patterns, the FC-ELMs are designed to first train small differences between patterns with the same angle and then to aggregate the differences at the output layer.

The complexity of this process depends on both the properties of data (non-stationary spectral signatures of classes, intrinsic high dimensionality) and the practical constraints in ground-truth data collection (which result in a small ratio between the number of training samples and spectral channels). Among the methods proposed in the literature for classification of hyperspectral images, semisupervised procedures (which in tegrate in the learning phase both labeled and unlabeled samples) and systems based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) seem to be particularly promising. In this paper we introduce a novel Progressive Semisupervised SVM technique (PS 3 VM) designed for the analysis of hyperspectral remote sensing data, which exploits a semisupervised process according to an iterative procedure. The proposed technique improves the one presented in [1,2], exhibiting three main advantages: i) an adaptive selection of the number of iterations of the semi-supervised learning pro cedure; ii) an effective model- selection strategy; iii) a high stability of the learning procedure. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, an extensive experimental analysis was carried out on an hyperspectral image acquired by the Hyperion sensor over the Okavango Delta (Botswana).

Due to the high dimensionality of microarray data sets, choosing reliable feature selection and classification algorithms with a high degree of accuracy and a low complexity is a crucial task in bioinformatics. Toward this goal, this paper aims to maximize the cancer classification accuracy using two reliable ensemble-based classifiers namely the ensemble of naive bayes and the ensemble of k-nearest neighbor. Simulation results show that our classifiers have considerably better accuracy than some conventional classification techniques such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and artificial neural networks in the field of multicategory microarray cancer classification based on fourteen cancer data set. However, the run time of the introduced ensemble-based classifiers is longer when the schemes use whole features. To reduce the time complexity while preserving the same classification accuracy as before, we use the recursive feature elimination based on the multiple support vector machine classifier to select more informative genes before applying the ensemble-based classifiers. Numerical evaluations show at least 30% improvement in the classification accuracy of our schemes when compared to the SVM-one versus one rule. In addition, our schemes are much more robust to the feature elimination and display a high accuracy in the case of low number of features.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599553", "venue": "2013 21st Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)", "journal": "2013 21st Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1998770015", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["9577508", "15467622", "82608152", "12929471", "34605562", "45176259", "15623274", "1069019", "14797500", "33683506", "119479891", "9186915", "45810617", "9542809", "17210997", "5175359", "6644398"], "inbound_citations": ["38036448", "19073137", "9563626", "505248"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2917645"}

Results highlighted the robustness of the above feature selection methods when used in conjunction with the random forest algorithm for analyzing hyperspectral data. Overall, the Boruta feature selection algorithm provided the best results.

Classification results were, however, significantly lower for P. patula seedlings, with a training error of 24.00%, independent test error of 38.00%, and an AUC value of 0.65. A hybrid selection method that utilizes combinations of wavebands selected from the three feature selection algorithms was also tested.

Predictive capability of SMOSVM was evaluated and compared with other landslide models, namely a hybrid model of the cascade generalization optimization-based support vector machine (CGSVM), individual models, such as support vector machines (SVM) and naive Bayes trees (NBT). For validation, different quantitative criteria such as statistical based methods and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) technique were used.

Conventional Mahalanobis-distance-based anomaly detection methods depend on the background statistics to construct the anomaly detection metric. One of the main problems with these methods is that the Gaussian distribution assumption of the background may not be reasonable. Furthermore, these methods are also susceptible to contamination of the conventional background covariance matrix by anomaly pixels. This paper proposes a new anomaly detection method by effectively exploiting a robust anomaly degree metric for increasing the separability between anomaly pixels and other background pixels, using discriminative information. First, the manifold feature is used so as to divide the pixels into the potential anomaly part and the potential background part. This procedure is called discriminative information learning. A metric learning method is then performed to obtain the robust anomaly degree measurements. Experiments with three hyperspectral data sets reveal that the proposed method outperforms other current anomaly detection methods. The sensitivity of the method to several important parameters is also investigated.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TGRS.2014.2303895", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2037034832", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["120317272", "7016383", "62194350", "1165496", "18041244", "1767369", "186638", "11003912", "36958850", "122042080", "31220742", "14211460", "120813083", "17069466", "33320862", "36740158", "42546271", "12283032", "1080166", "6546550", "13060558", "13274416", "121795948", "6894357", "964268", "5667482", "4532591", "121771971", "27974219", "8848482", "1169112", "3225583", "11113049", "6999272", "9096902", "15106876", "3117065", "62359231", "47325215", "34917506", "47325215", "719304", "14979204", "18040001", "9462236", "206687235", "119914629"], "inbound_citations": ["213741659", "51629374", "59544113", "7040622", "30934591", "204199326", "4490815", "206668929", "182304926", "34813936", "129993477", "209925612", "52304375", "51893515", "209495328", "203605803", "39492345", "5860938", "10842394", "3307454", "5090290", "197492282", "20705436", "51603212", "24921529", "33818854", "5050142", "30617080", "14440573", "52825783", "210993898", "3472451", "22741624", "7714706", "49566888", "115200106", "36947845", "9855973", "85556639", "23825616", "3740807", "51924013", "53092917", "215184327", "118685763", "51606476", "53757339", "65109865", "131777268", "25331256", "199675130", "733235", "203111356", "10397600", "17914532", "60442854", "930720", "4109032", "203186479", "44431252", "3591490", "24700944", "35544519", "102497843", "52291300", "21234154", "44070781", "45615413", "15992013", "3110415", "123783952", "18984273", "11707694", "69789391", "46960237", "204229844", "1525786", "28844850", "36704579", "14685656", "20476936", "19867057", "130505862", "13712735", "3414583", "155106414", "207393199", "25023522", "67876069", "13247273", "430010", "4907116", "63443059", "25811633", "39311015", "203655495", "198408769", "54455900", "90263173", "52927586", "20763502", "27453746", "50776254", "27382772", "374911", "678821", "14986096", "206694463", "44825486", "127620549", "8006127", "52984843", "208033922", "203080154", "20592315", "9781946", "23061918", "30247444", "3481325", "35382151", "22270920", "16387982", "145959428", "5595321", "3978486", "61810422", "5959411", "3014112", "4624178", "4270863", "16069989", "1886230", "60443006", "67399101"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14972102"}

Recently, multi-task feature learning algorithms have received increasing attention and they have been successfully applied to many applications involving high dimensional data. However, they assume that all tasks share a common set of features, which is too restrictive and may not hold in real-world applications, since outlier tasks often exist. In this paper, we propose a Robust Multi-Task Feature Learning algorithm (rMTFL) which simultaneously captures a common set of features among relevant tasks and identifies outlier tasks. Specifically, we decompose the weight (model) matrix for all tasks into two components. We impose the well-known group Lasso penalty on row groups of the first component for capturing the shared features among relevant tasks. To simultaneously identify the outlier tasks, we impose the same group Lasso penalty but on column groups of the second component. We propose to employ the accelerated gradient descent to efficiently solve the optimization problem in rMTFL, and show that the proposed algorithm is scalable to large-size problems. In addition, we provide a detailed theoretical analysis on the proposed rMTFL formulation. Specifically, we present a theoretical bound to measure how well our proposed rMTFL approximates the true evaluation, and provide bounds to measure the error between the estimated weights of rMTFL and the underlying true weights. Moreover, by assuming that the underlying true weights are above the noise level, we present a sound theoretical result to show how to obtain the underlying true shared features and outlier tasks (sparsity patterns). Empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our proposed rMTFL is capable of simultaneously capturing shared features among tasks and identifying outlier tasks.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3783219", "pubmed_id": "24078896", "doi": "10.1145/2339530.2339672", "venue": "KDD : proceedings.

The Total Sky Imager (TSI) is one of the best instruments for accurate short-term irradiance forecasting but is limited to a forecast of approximately five minutes for low altitude clouds, which usually cause large ground irradiance fluctuations.

Majority of these challenges are expected to be mitigated through color space conversion.

The proposed hybrid color space which termed P1P2P3 consist of the three major Principal Components of these conventional color spaces components. Using Algebraic simplification these principal component has been reformulated in terms of RGB color space. Parametric pixel wised skin detection techniques have been employed in order to evaluate the proposed color space effect on skin detection performance. Three popular supervised classifiers including Multilayer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest has been employed to generate a parametric model of skin color cluster using the proposed color space.

Deep learning has been used successfully in computer vision problems, e.g. image classification, target detection and many more. We use deep learning in conjunction with ArcGIS to implement a model with advanced convolutional neural networks (CNN) for lithological mapping in the Mount Isa region (Australia). The area is ideal for spectral remote sensing as there is only sparse vegetation and besides freely available Sentinel-2 and ASTER data, several geophysical datasets are available from exploration campaigns. By fusing the data and thus covering a wide spectral range as well as capturing geophysical properties of rocks, we aim at improving classification accuracies and support geological mapping. We also evaluate the performance of the sensors on their own compared to a joint use as the Sentinel-2 satellites are relatively new and as of now there exist only few studies for geological applications. We developed an end-to-end deep learning model using Keras and Tensorflow that consists of several convolutional, pooling and deconvolutional layers. Our model was inspired by the family of U-Net architectures, where low-level feature maps (encoders) are concatenated with high-level ones (decoders), which enables precise localization. This type of network architecture was especially designed to effectively solve pixel-wise classification problems, which is appropriate for lithological classification. We spatially resampled and fused the multi-sensor remote sensing data with different bands and geophysical data into image cubes as input for our model. Pre-processing was done in ArcGIS and the final, fine-tuned model was imported into a toolbox to be used on further scenes directly in the GIS environment. The tool classifies each pixel of the multiband imagery into different types of rocks according to a defined probability threshold. Results highlight the power of using Sentinel-2 in conjunction with ASTER data with accuracies of 75% in comparison to only 70% and 73% for ASTER or Sentinel-2 data alone. These results are similar but examining the different classes shows that there are significant improvements for classes such as dolerite or carbonate sediments that are not that widely distributed in the area. Adding geophysical datasets reduced accuracies to 60%, probably due to an order of magnitude difference in spatial resolution. In comparison, Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) that were trained on the same data only achieve accuracies of 46 % and 36 % respectively. Most insecurity is due to labelling errors and labels with mixed lithologies.

A conventional deep learning model is prone to privacy attacks that can recover the sensitive information of individuals from either model parameters or accesses to the target model. Recently, differential privacy that offers provable privacy guarantees has been proposed to train neural networks in a privacy-preserving manner to protect training data. However, many approaches tend to provide the worst case privacy guarantees for model publishing, inevitably impairing the accuracy of the trained models. In this paper, we present a novel private knowledge transfer strategy, where the private teacher trained on sensitive data is not publicly accessible but teaches a student to be publicly released. In particular, a three-player (teacher-student-discriminator) learning framework is proposed to achieve trade-off between utility and privacy, where the student acquires the distilled knowledge from the teacher and is trained with the discriminator to generate similar outputs as the teacher. We then integrate a differential privacy protection mechanism into the learning procedure, which enables a rigorous privacy budget for the training. The framework eventually allows student to be trained with only unlabelled public data and very few epochs, and hence prevents the exposure of sensitive training data, while ensuring model utility with a modest privacy budget. The experiments on MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR-10 datasets show that our students obtain the accuracy losses w.r.t teachers of 0.89%, 2.29%, 5.16%, respectively with the privacy bounds of (1.93, 10^-5), (5.02, 10^-6), (8.81, 10^-6).

Therefore in this paper we proposed a flexible support vector regression (F-SVR) in which parameters are adaptive to sample dataset distributions during training. The method F-SVR divides the training sample dataset into several domains according to the distribution complexity, and generates a different parameter set for each domain. The efficacy of the proposed method is validated on an artificial dataset, where F-SVR yields better generalization ability than conventional SVR methods while maintaining good learning ability.

A simple random sampling method in random forest using default mtry parameter to choose feature subspace, will select too many subspaces without informative SNPs. Exhaustive searching an optimal mtry is often required in order to include useful and relevant SNPs and get rid of vast of non-informative SNPs. However, it is too time-consuming and not favorable in GWA for high-dimensional data. The main aim of this paper is to propose a stratified sampling method for feature subspace selection to generate decision trees in a random forest for GWA high-dimensional data. Our idea is to design an equal-width discretization scheme for informativeness to divide SNPs into multiple groups. In feature subspace selection, we randomly select the same number of SNPs from each group and combine them to form a subspace to generate a decision tree. The advantage of this stratified sampling procedure can make sure each subspace contains enough useful SNPs, but can avoid a very high computational cost of exhaustive search of an optimal mtry, and maintain the randomness of a random forest. We employ two genome-wide SNP data sets (Parkinson case-control data comprised of 408 803 SNPs and Alzheimer case-control data comprised of 380 157 SNPs) to demonstrate that the proposed stratified sampling method is effective, and it can generate better random forest with higher accuracy and lower error bound than those by Breiman's random forest generation method.

One current difficulty in interpreting microarray data comes from their innate nature of 'high-dimensional low sample size'. Therefore, robust and accurate gene selection methods are required to identify differentially expressed group of genes across different samples, e.g. between cancerous and normal cells. Successful gene selection will help to classify different cancer types, lead to a better understanding of genetic signatures in cancers and improve treatment strategies. Although gene selection and cancer classification are two closely related problems, most existing approaches handle them separately by selecting genes prior to classification. We provide a unified procedure for simultaneous gene selection and cancer classification, achieving high accuracy in both aspects. ::: ::: Results: In this paper we develop a novel type of regularization in support vector machines (SVMs) to identify important genes for cancer classification. A special nonconvex penalty, called the smoothly clipped absolute deviation penalty, is imposed on the hinge loss function in the SVM. By systematically thresholding small estimates to zeros, the new procedure eliminates redundant genes automatically and yields a compact and accurate classifier. A successive quadratic algorithm is proposed to convert the non-differentiable and non-convex optimization problem into easily solved linear equation systems. The method is applied to two real datasets and has produced very promising results. ::: ::: Availability: MATLAB codes are available upon request from the authors. ::: ::: Contact: hzhang@stat.ncsu.edu ::: ::: Supplementary information: http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~hzhang/research.html", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "16249260", "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/bti736", "venue": "Bioinformatics", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2117526678", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["1764712", "3115693", "7291147", "207165665", "5885974", "115770925", "60486887", "31991006", "16454925", "10039376", "2914506", "747118", "61649919", "2315419", "22793962", "2789179", "10142996", "2279518", "12404585", "2738228", "16162039", "7515110"], "inbound_citations": ["24138663", "15837431", "17169232", "18563577", "1703112", "73603", "24729223", "8218458", "17482422", "15266833", "18955683", "54841072", "59231158", "6725543", "206605395", "6614714", "54554502", "17058982", "18987264", "21961673", "18939547", "1580003", "7485250", "26129465", "196622203", "4988869", "2056485", "49350282", "15850322", "11753454", "9676568", "16710832", "15128842", "8442814", "15305914", "5812132", "1134221", "6210812", "8970783", "214923229", "10677655", "7591348", "14210127", "13740610", "940966", "18897939", "52188689", "35338324", "211297621", "64025490", "15440492", "49304201", "874128", "109937094", "6030279", "67750799", "17464846", "18871497", "23364513", "30741489", "14279530", "6157979", "11255071", "215118566", "17641174", "7849944", "3540990", "8565221", "13433882", "299852", "824432", "6874620", "2671090", "1737490", "22511062", "215093921", "14129321", "215588906", "201839304", "52259747", "14200221", "4759310", "1285360", "39504688", "14600434", "10864105", "7254459", "51848836", "8441633", "8212356", "13014240", "16049948", "1451691", "15612574", "11462943", "39553894", "29024899", "202558409", "10757159", "88471562", "1391023", "55853997", "2996623", "14378271", "1489733", "17770669", "16993462", "195906112", "13325386", "215302494", "18372895", "1507718", "34611305", "12902927", "14090802", "3022573", "18103624", "14729147", "2531211", "16374978", "174802363", "781306", "44116683", "20670034", "56169007", "215338235", "12420117", "15672718", "13699324", "8420124", "36928348"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14791297"}

Many association studies between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of candidate genes and CHD have been reported. We have applied a new method to analyze such relationships using support vector machines (SVMs), which is one of the methods for artificial neuronal network. We assumed that common haplotype implicit in genotypes will differ between cases and controls, and that this will allow SVM-derived patterns to be classifiable according to subject genotypes. Fourteen SNPs of ten candidate genes in 86 CHD patients and 119 controls were investigated. Genotypes were transformed to a numerical vector by giving scores based on difference between the genotypes of each subject and the reference genotypes, which represent the healthy normal population. Overall classification accuracy by SVMs was 64.4% with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area of 0.639. By conventional analysis using the chi2 test, the association between CHD and the SNP of the scavenger receptor B1 gene was most significant in terms of allele frequencies in cases vs. controls (p = 0.0001). In conclusion, we suggest that the application of SVMs for association studies of SNPs in candidate genes shows considerable promise and that further work could be usefully performed upon the estimation of CHD susceptibility in individuals of high risk.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "12747598", "doi": "10.1515/CCLM.2003.080", "venue": "Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine", "journal": "Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2047670203,2185171978", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["10556268", "25092309", "18085917", "22669729", "195690771", "28637672", "2698102", "9153108", "18858479", "22211364", "20059205"], "inbound_citations": ["18706333", "16604907", "11942561", "129628864", "17295051", "15352157", "15135884", "18401995", "18001139", "15986311", "3890662", "16841825", "674152", "23447526", "21526406"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11718083"}

To cope and manage this situation, monitoring spatial and temporal dynamics of the irrigated area land use at basin level is needed to ensure proper allocation of water. Publicly available satellite data at high spatial resolution and advances in remote sensing techniques offer a viable opportunity. In this study, we developed a new approach using time series of Landsat 8 (L8) data and Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm by introducing a hierarchical post-processing scheme to extract key Land Use Land Cover (LULC) types. We implemented this approach for Mashhad basin in Iran to develop a LULC map at 15 m spatial resolution with nine classes for the crop year 2015/2016. In addition, five irrigated land use types were extracted for three crop years-2013/2014, 2014/2015, and 2015/2016-using the RF models. The total irrigated area was estimated at 1796.16 kmc, 1581.7 km 2 and 1578.26 km 2 for the cropping years 2013/2014, 2014/2015 and 2015/2016, respectively.

In this work, ant colony (ACO) optimization was developed to search the optimal control parameters so as to achieve this purpose. ACO is a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm for solving both discrete and continuous optimization problems. As a case study to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method, SVR model is constructed for correlating historic data comprising values of operating and output variables of a boiler. Parameters selection was performed with the help of ACO. Next, model inputs describing process operating variables are also optimized using ACO with a view to maximize the combustion efficiency of the boiler. The results showed that the proposed approach, by comparing with neural network model, was an efficient way to model boiler in automation style with good predictive accuracy. ACO and SVR provide a useful tool for maximizing the combustion efficiency of boiler.

It is now feasible to determine the comprehensive system that these factors constitute. Among its features, this system has a relatively closed, universally available inventory of fundamental spatial elements that are combined to form whole schemas; it has a relatively closed set of categories that these elements appear in; and it, therefore, has a relatively closed, small number of particular elements in each category of spatial distinctions that each category can ever mark. By contrast, the structural representation of space in signed language systematically differs from that in spoken language in the direction of what appear to be the structural characteristics of scene parsing in visual perception. Among such differences, signed language can mark finer spatial distinctions with its greater inventory of structural elements, categories, and elements per category. It represents many more of these distinctions in any particular expression. It also represents these distinctions independently in the expression, not bundled together into \uff02pre-packaged\uff02 schemas. And its spatial representations are largely iconic with visible spatial characteristics. The findings suggest that instead of some discrete whole-language module, spoken language and signed language are both based on some more limited core linguistic system that then connects with different further subsystems for the full functioning of the two different language modalities. The different behaviors of the two language modalities are plausible, given the apparently different intrinsic properties of the neural systems underlying them.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1075/tsl.66.13tal", "venue": "Space in Languages", "journal": "Space in Languages", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "17663884", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["141641607", "124007823", "141864691", "61363578", "56488303", "144648170", "59889057"], "inbound_citations": ["51845313", "53824383", "61617992"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14251386"}

Example applications include classification for detecting spam, network intrusion detection, and credit card scoring. In fact, as the use of machine learning grows in diverse application domains, the possibility for adversarial behavior is likely to increase. When adversarial learning is modelled in a game-theoretic setup, the standard assumption about the adversary (player) behavior is the ability to change all features of the classifiers (the opponent player) at will. The adversary pays a cost proportional to the size of the \u201cattack\u201d. We refer to this form of adversarial behavior as a dense feature attack. However, the aim of an adversary is not just to subvert a classifier but carry out data transformation in a way such that spam continues to remain effective. We demonstrate that an adversary could potentially achieve this objective by carrying out a sparse feature attack. We design an algorithm to show how a classifier should be designed to be robust against sparse adversarial attacks. Our main insight is that sparse feature attacks are best defended by designing classifiers which use $\\ell _{1}$ regularizers.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TKDE.2018.2790928", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2783155279", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["62626564", "14134514", "6259400", "2116006", "10531464", "3420849", "17497337", "17497168", "4680046", "6637466", "9277097", "1139917", "1033682", "12803511", "1282515", "26639305", "16832016", "15174027", "60282629", "119150", "59849738", "1876650", "152536206", "6343003", "15314393", "11758569"], "inbound_citations": ["210695379", "155798187", "198169032", "67865045", "67024195", "86587621"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13746123"}

While recent works based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) made remarkable progress, there is still an obstacle for making accurate and realistic predictions.

More specifically, our model is a multi-stage generative network, which is named the Difference Guided Generative Adversarial Netwok (DGGAN). The DGGAN learns to explicitly enforce future-frame predictions that is guided by synthetic inter-frame difference. Given a sequence of frames, DGGAN first uses dual paths to generate meta information. One path, called Coarse Frame Generator, predicts the coarse details about future frames, and the other path, called Difference Guide Generator, generates the difference image which include complementary fine details. Then our coarse details will then be refined via guidance of difference image under the support of GANs.

Next, we study transfer learning via fine-tuning from large scale datasets to small scale, domain-specific FGVC datasets. We propose a measure to estimate domain similarity via Earth Mover's Distance and demonstrate that transfer learning benefits from pre-training on a source domain that is similar to the target domain by this measure.

We address this issue by first learning manifolds for specific regions and then computing region-specific deformations from these manifolds.

Our method, named as Sparsity regularization Label Propagation for Domain Adaptation Learning (SLPDAL), can propagate the labels of the labeled data from both domains to the unlabeled one in the target domain using their sparsely reconstructed objects with sufficient smoothness by using three steps: (1) an optimal RKHS is first recovered so as to minimize the data distributions of two domains; (2) it then computes the best kernel sparse reconstructed coefficients for each data point in both domains by using l\"1-norm minimization in the RKHS, thus constructing a sparse graph; and (3) the labels of the labeled data from both domains is finally propagated to the unlabeled points in the target domain over the sparse graph based on our proposed sparsity regularization framework, in which it is assumed that the label of each data point can be sparsely reconstructed by those of other data points from both domains.

In recent years, due to the privatization and deregulation of the power industry, accurate forecasting of future electricity demand has become an important research area for secure operation, management of modern power systems and electricity production in the power generation sector. This paper presents a novel approach for mid-term electricity load forecasting. It uses a hybrid artificial intelligence scheme based on self-organizing maps (SOMs) and support vector machines (SVMs). According to the similarity degree of time series input samples, the SOM is used as a filtering scheme to cluster historical electricity load data into two subsets using the Kohonen rule in an unsupervised manner. As a novel learning machine, the SVM based on statistical learning theory is used for prediction, using support vector regression (SVR). Two epsilon-SVRs are employed to fit the training data of each SOM clustered subset individually in a supervised manner for load prediction. The proposed hybrid SOM-SVR model is evaluated in MATLAB on the electricity load dataset used in the European Network on Intelligent Technologies (EUNITE) competition, arranged by the Eastern Slovakian Electricity Corporation. This proposed model is robust with different data types and can deal well with non- stationarity of load series. Practical application results show that this hybrid technique gives far better prediction accuracy for mid-term electricity load forecasting compared to previous research findings.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2308049212", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["17146430", "15837422", "42475792", "1964940", "961425"], "inbound_citations": ["54904053", "32889218", "25303171", "57764169", "18070299", "1188645", "11787406", "44089518", "16787603"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18684139"}

There exists an opportunity to reduce energy waste by improving the scheduling of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) based on occupancy. However, to enable this potential, we require more accurate methods for predicting occupancy to deliver the required level of comfort when rooms are occupied. This paper examines the novel use of multi-label classification (MLC) for predicting occupancy of rooms based on data from motion sensors. Stating the occupancy prediction problem as an MLC problem enables the use of existing MLC algorithms and provides a solid foundation for evaluating the performance of the predictive models. Our implemented algorithms are benchmarked against an existing occupancy prediction technique (PreHeat) on a dataset from two commercial buildings. The results show that PreHeat and Support Vector Machine (SVM) outperforms other algorithms for rooms with high occupancy frequency. Other machine learning algorithms outperform PreHeat and SVM for rooms with low occupancy frequency. In total, SVM provides a more robust performance than other algorithms with a significantly higher count of highest prediction accuracy for observed scenarios. Our experimental results also highlight that prediction performance for commercial buildings depends more on occupancy frequency than occupancy rate, and the occupancy state before the prediction horizon. By presenting more accurate algorithms for occupancy prediction, we hope to foster the development of more energy-efficient HVAC scheduling systems to reduce overall energy consumption.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/PERCOMW.2016.7457147", "venue": "2016 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communication Workshops (PerCom Workshops)", "journal": "2016 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communication Workshops (PerCom Workshops)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2338457167", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["13541601", "3059113", "16309206", "17982363", "10799440", "10659969", "1004907", "30053091"], "inbound_citations": ["16021349", "42027570", "5765192", "12105229", "132564581", "54628341", "4713904", "198951351", "14269858"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18685814"}

In this paper, we propose to evaluate the SD magnitude, using the ratio of votes from the Random Forest algorithm performed on 3D geometric features related to the face morphology.

In the Intra-group experiments, when the training is performed with scans of similar SD magnitude than the testing scan, the classification accuracy improves. In Inter-group experiments, the scans with low magnitude of SD demonstrate higher gender discrimination power than the ones with high SD magnitude.

Some approaches, such as Pegasos [1] have had great success solving the primal problem, rather than the dual. We follow the idea of solving the primal, rather than dual, problem but introduce a new algorithm that makes minimal use of the gradient and uses approximate second-order information in the form of an approximate Hessian. In particular, we present a new algorithm for solving the soft-margin SVM optimization problem with an l^1 penalty, called SmSVM. This algorithm is designed to require a modest number of passes over the data and can achieve an optimal solution with a minimal number of gradient calculations. The algorithm uses a smooth approximation for the hinge-loss function, and an active set approach for the l^1 penalty. We use the active set approach to make implementation optimizations by taking advantage of the feature selection to reduce the problem size of our matrix-vector and vector-vector linear algebra operations. These optimizations result in substantially faster training times, in addition to providing feature selection. Our experiments show impressive results, beating LIBLINEAR [2] in many scenarios both in test accuracy and training time.

Spectral signature analysis showed that band 1 - Coastal/Aerosol (0.433\u20130.453 \u03bcm), band 2 - Blue (0.450\u20130.515 \u03bcm) and band 3 - Green (0.525\u20130.600 \u03bcm) are sensitive to salinity . Furthermore, to have a comprehensive investigation, the Support Vector Regression (SVR) method was applied. The outcomes related to the quality of the SVR depend on several factors e.g. proper setting of the SVR meta-parameters, therefore, to deal with this issue Genetic Algorithm (GA) was applied. The SVR model resulted in values of R2 and RMSE for test data which are respectively obtained to be 0.7 and 390 \u03bcs cm\u22121. Eventually, Karun water salinity maps were prepared by SVR method to demonstrate the Karun water salinity on 1 February 2015 and 5 September 2018.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-4-W18-97-2019", "venue": null, "journal": "ISPRS - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2981012098", "mag_field_of_study": ["Environmental Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2043246", "123413436", "154669510", "134921362", "118324434", "40223038", "59752996", "88374667", "122339878", "133101289"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:207827173"}

Insufficiency of vitamin D during pregnancy predicts bone mass and hence predicts adult osteoporosis (Javaid et al., 2006). The relationship between maternal vitamin D and manually measured fetal biometry has been studied (Mahon et al., 2009). However, manual fetal biometry especially volumetric measurements are subjective, time-consuming and possibly irreproducible. Computerised measurements can overcome or at least reduce such problems. This thesis concerns the development and evaluation of novel methods to do this. This thesis makes three contributions. Firstly, we have developed a novel technique based on the Random Forests (RF) classifier to segment and measure several fetal femoral characteristics from 3D ultrasound volumes automatically. We propose a feature selection step in the training stage to eliminate irrelevant features and utilise the \"good\" ones. We also develop a weighted voting mechanism to weight tree probabilistic decisions in the RF classifier. We show that the new RF classifier is more accurate than the classic method (Yaqub et al., 2010b, Yaqub et al., 2011b). We achieved 83% segmentation precision using the proposed technique compared to manually segmented volumes. The proposed segmentation technique was also validated on segmenting adult brain structures in MR images and it showed excellent accuracy. The second contribution is a wavelet-based image fusion technique to enhance the quality of the fetal femur and to compensate for missing information in one volume due to signal attenuation and acoustic shadowing. We show that using image fusion to increase the image quality of ultrasound images of bony structures leads to a more accurate and reproducible assessment and measurement qualitatively and quantitatively (Yaqub et al., 2010a, Yaqub et al., 2011a). The third contribution concerns the analysis of data from a cohort study of 450 fetal femoral ultrasound volumes (18-21 week gestation). The femur length, cross-sectional areas, volume, splaying indices and angles were automatically measured using the RF method. The relationship between these measurements and the fetal gestational age and maternal vitamin D was investigated. Segmentation of a fetal femur is fast (2.3s/volume), thanks to the parallel implementation. The femur volume, length, splaying index were found to significantly correlate with fetal gestational age. Furthermore, significant correlations between the automatic measurements and 10 nmol increment in maternal 25OHD during second trimester were found.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2284332290", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62110384"}

The goal of this dissertation work is to solve different biomedical data analysis problems efficiently using extensions of SVM, in which we augment the standard SVM formulation based on the application requirements. The biomedical applications we explore in this thesis include: cancer diagnosis, biomarker discovery, and energy function learning for protein structure prediction. ::: Ovarian cancer diagnosis is problematic because the disease is typically asymptomatic especially at early stages of progression and/or recurrence. We investigate a sample set consisting of 44 women diagnosed with serous papillary ovarian cancer and 50 healthy women or women with benign conditions. We profile the relative metabolite levels in the patient sera using a high throughput ambient ionization mass spectrometry technique, Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART). We then reduce the diagnostic classification on these metabolic profiles into a functional classification problem and solve it with functional Support Vector Machine (fSVM) method. The assay distinguished between the cancer and control groups with an unprecedented 99% accuracy (100% sensitivity, 98% specificity) under leave-one-out-cross-validation. This approach has significant clinical potential as a cancer diagnostic tool. ::: High throughput technologies provide simultaneous evaluation of thousands of potential biomarkers to distinguish different patient groups. In order to assist biomarker discovery from these low sample size high dimensional cancer data, we first explore a convex relaxation of the L0-SVM problem and solve it using mixed-integer programming techniques. We further propose a more efficient L0-SVM approximation, fractional norm SVM, by replacing the L2-penalty with Lq-penalty (q in (0,1)) in the optimization formulation. We solve it through Difference of Convex functions (DC) programming technique. Empirical studies on the synthetic data sets as well as the real-world biomedical data sets support the effectiveness of our proposed L0-SVM approximation methods over other commonly-used sparse SVM methods such as the L1-SVM method. ::: A critical open problem in ab initio protein folding is protein energy function design. We reduce the problem of learning energy function for ab initio folding to a standard machine learning problem, learning-to-rank.

We conduct the empirical study on an energy data set for random conformations of 171 proteins that falls into the ab initio folding class.

Mammography is the preferred method for breast cancer detection. The purpose is to investigate the feasibility and accuracy of texture features extracted from digital mammograms at predicting benign and malignant breast mass using Radiomics. Methods 494 digital mammograms data who diagnosed as breast masses (Benign: 251 Malignant: 243) by mammography were enrolled. Enrol criteria: breast masses classified as BI-RADS 3, 4, and 5 and at last confirmed by histopathology. Lesion area was marked with a rectangular frame on the Cranio-Caudal (CC) and MedioLateral Oblique (MLO) images at the 5M workstation. The rectangular regions of interest (ROI) was segmented and 456 radiomics features were extracted from every ROI. Extracted features were dimensioned by Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy (MRMR) and Lasso algorithm. Post-dimension features were classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM). 70% of the data as a training set and the other 30% as a testing set. The reliability of the Classifier was evaluated by the 10-fold cross-validation. The classification accuracy was evaluated by the accuracy and sensitivity and AUC. Results Both the MRMR and Lasso screened 30 radiomics features respectively. 10-fold cross-validation showed that their accuracy were 88.70% and 86.71%, respectively. In testing sets, Through the MRMR algorithm, the classifier achieves an accuracy of 92.00% and a sensitivity of 91.10% and AUC of 95.10%. Through the lasso dimension reduction algorithm, the classifier achieves an accuracy of 83.26% and a sensitivity of 75.90% and AUC of 89.38%. Conclusions Radiomics texture features from digital mammograms may be used for benign and malignant prediction. This method offer better accuracy and sensitivity.

Deep metric learning has gained noticeable success in fine-grained image categorization problem, however, it cannot be directly applied to classification of patients with hierarchical disease labels. In this paper, we present a novel three layer patient similarity deep metric learning framework (PSDML) by optimizing quadruple loss improved from triplet loss, to learn an embedding distance for disease classification among the patients. The context semantic relation of multi diagnosis labels encoding by ICD-10 is taken into account to compute the supervised distance of patients. To solve the diagnosis class imbalance, patient tuples that violate deep metric learning framework loss constraints are chosen prior as samples to accelerate the convergence of the neural network.

However, the low-dose CT acquisition inherently compromises the signal-to-noise ratio, and the sparse sampled thick slices poorly reproduce the coronal/sagittal anatomy. We propose a Residual Voxel Generative Adversarial Nets (ResVoxGAN), the first powerful work to densely reconstruct slices into the thin thickness (1 mm), and simultaneously denoise the CT image into the more readable pattern, directly from the widely accessible thick low-dose CT. The framework is achieved in a voxel-wise conditional GAN constituted by the following: (1) a generator is composed of consecutive 3D multi-scale residual blocks that richly extracts multi-scale stereo feature for fine-granted and latent spatial structure mining from the noisy volume, and a followed Subpixel Convnet further interpretively reconstructs dense slices from the features for high-resolution and denoising volume; (2) a stereo-correlation constraint elegantly penalizes gradient deviation in voxel adjacent region (i.e., 3D 26-neighborhoods) to guide structural detail, together with a image-expression constraint on perceptual feature representations transformed from a pretrained deep convolution autoencoder to keep scene content; and (3) a pair of coupled discriminators advantageously fuse the prior-knowledge from the thick low-dose CT with the generated image and residual noise via self-learning to drive the generation towards into both realistic anatomic structure distribution and valid noise-reduction distribution. The experiment validated on Mayo dataset shows that the ResVoxGAN successfully reconstruct the low-dose CT of 3 mm thickness into 1 mm, and meanwhile keeps the with peak signal to noise ratio of 40.80 for noise reduction, and structural similarity index of 0.918 for dense slices reconstruction.

This recognition process needs to deal with all kind of variations including different modalities, facial appearance exaggerations, changes in viewpoint, expression, and illumination, etc. All these variations lead to severe misalignment between features of caricatures and photos. To deal with these problems, a specifically designed facial landmark based feature extraction scheme is proposed, where features of caricatures and photos are extracted using different feature extraction steps. At each facial landmark, features of photos are extracted with fixed viewing angle and scale, while features of caricatures are extracted with different scales and viewing angles. To measure the similarity of these features, multiple cross-modal metrics are learned at different facial landmarks in one optimization framework to guarantee global optimum. As the measured features are from two modalities (caricature and photo), cross-modal metric is used to remove modality variations. Pooling at distance level is used during metric optimization to further align the features of caricatures and photos. The introduced pooling step makes the learning method more robust to variations.

There are three phases involved in this project which are data collection, processing (i.e feature extraction and classification) and post processing (i.e test and evaluation). For the data collection, 200 images from two different species of birds which are snowy owl and toucan has been collected from Datasets for Computer Vision Study website. All the bird image dataset are utilized as the train and test image data. The color moment extracted from the bird images in processing phase. There are nine color features experimented which are mean, standard deviation, and skewness. These nine color features are computed from the color component of red, green, and blue. The feature vectors of mean, standard deviation and skewness are then applied in Support Vector Machine to classify two group of bird species. The results proved that it significantly works on two bird species of Snowy Owl and Toucan to classify that bird images.

Mahmudul Hasan \u22171 , Md. Humayun Kabir \u20201 and M. Ameer Ali \u20212 Department of CSE, BUET, Dhaka, Bangladesh Department of CSE, East West University, Dhaka, Bangladesh Abstract Automatic license plate detection and recognition has numerous applications. A large number of schemes have already been proposed in order to make the detection and recognition process efficient. However, a very little work has been done on Bengali license plate recognition. Wide variation among the license plate patterns, complex background, and the difficulty in segmenting Bengali characters of Bangladeshi license plates make it inefficient to use the existing algorithms. In this paper, we propose a solution for Bengali license plate detection and recognition. We use three stages of conventional license plate recognition system. However, we propose new algorithm in each stage, which are effective for Bengali license plate detection and recognition. We tested our algorithms for over 250 images taken from the road. We achieve over 95% success in Bengali license plate recognition. Introduction Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR) is one of the important module of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Research works [1] and [2] have listed many applications of ALPR, such as electronic payment systems (toll payment or parking), free-way and aerial management for traffic surveillance, recovering stolen cars, identifying cars with an open warrant for arrest, catching speeders by comparing the average time it takes to get from one stationary camera to another stationary camera, determining what cars do or do not belong to a parking garage, expediting parking by eliminating the need for human confirmation of parking passes etc. Most of the ALPR systems use three stages of processing [1]. In the first stage, the location of the license plate is determined from the input image. The input may be a video sequence or a still image. These image may be a binary, a grey scale, or a color image. Therefore, either binary or grey scale or color image processing technique is used in this stage. Morphological analysis [6], vertical and horizontal edge detection [16] [7], connected component analysis [17], spatial measurement [17], etc. are the most widely used binary image processing techniques. Image transformation [19], region segmentation [20], [3], hierarchical representations [18], etc. are widely used grey scale image processing techniques. Research works [11] and [12] used color image processing. Fuzzy set theory was used in research works [22] and [21]. In the second stage, the characters inside the license plate region are segmented. Binary and grey scale image processing techniques are mainly used to segment the characters. In the binary image processing techniques, several methods such as horizontal and vertical projection [24] [23] [11], mathematical morphology [25] [24], and contours [26] are used. Methods like local and adaptive threshold [28] [27], histogram processing [30] [29], classifiers [31] [32] etc. are the most commonly used grey scale image processing techniques to segment the characters. The third and the last stage in license plate detection and recognition system is the character recognition stage. Different types of neural networks, such as Hidden Markov Model (HMM) [35], Support Vector Machine (SVM) [18], and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) [36] [22] [30] are used to classify the characters. Other than neural networks, pattern or template matching techniques [34] [33] are also used to recognize the characters. Although a large number of research works have already been conducted on automatic license plate detection and recognition system, a generalized system is still missing [3]. Most of the existing systems perform well under some specific constraints. These constraints are certain distance from the camera [6] [7], speed of the vehicle [8], illumination conditions [9] [10], color of the vehicle [11] [12], camera positions [13] etc. Moreover, these \u2217 mhasa004@ucr.edu.

A Pairwise Adaptive C and \u03c5-SVM (pa-SVM) were evaluated for creating the facial expression classifier. In both scenarios, a dataset of human faces and facial expressions was used to produce a number of preprocessed images (grayscale, histogram equalised grayscale; and their respective Sobel and Canny edges) at a number of resolutions for analysis. A Gaussian and a degree two polynomial kernel were used with the SVM methods and the results were obtained using a 10 fold cross validation technique. A concern with the face detectors is verifying that they can look for minimal face-like patterns empirically. To address this concern, we created cartoon faces of the human face dataset and degraded these cartoon faces to produce an array of minimal face-like patterns.

Firstly, the weight of each feature for classification is computed by using Importance Factor based I-Relief algorithm (IFIR) and the irrelevant features are eliminated.

The system differs from existing variational autoencoders (VAEs) in that the prior distribution used to model each code is conditioned on a similar code from the dataset. In compression terms this equates to sequentially transmitting the dataset using an ordering determined by proximity in latent space. Since the prior need only account for local, rather than global variations in the latent space, the coding cost is greatly reduced, leading to rich, informative codes. Crucially, the codes remain informative when powerful, autoregressive decoders are used, which we argue is fundamentally difficult with normal VAEs. Experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet and CelebA show that ACNs discover high-level latent features such as object class, writing style, pose and facial expression, which can be used to cluster and classify the data, as well as to generate diverse and convincing samples.

The technique used relied on a two-stage hybrid classification process: the first stage applied a knowledge-driven learning scheme to provide a land cover map (LC), including deciduous vegetation and other classes, without the need of reference training data; the second stage exploited a data-driven classification to: (i) discriminate pixels of the invasive species found within the deciduous vegetation layer of the LC map; (ii) determine the most favourable seasons for such recognition. In the second stage, when a traditional Maximum Likelihood classifier was used, the results obtained with multi-temporal July and October WV-2 images, showed an output Overall Accuracy (OA) value of \u224891%. To increase such a value, first a low-pass median filtering was used with a resulting OA of 99.2%, then, a Support Vector Machine classifier was applied obtaining the best A. altissima User\u2019s Accuracy (UA) and OA values of 82.47% and 97.96%, respectively, without any filtering. When instead of the full multi-spectral bands set some spectral vegetation indices computed from the same months were used the UA and OA values decreased. The findings reported suggest that multi-temporal, very high resolution satellite imagery can be effective for A. altissima mapping, especially when airborne hyperspectral data are unavailable. Since training data are required only in the second stage to discriminate A. altissima from other deciduous plants, the use of the first stage LC mapping as pre-filter can render the hybrid technique proposed cost and time effective.

Many heart diseases can be found by analyzing ECG. Thus ECG analyzing method with good performance is very helpful for determining human heart status. Support vector machine (SVM) is a popular pattern classification method in ECG analysis and diagnosis. Kernel parameter setting in the SVM training procedure significantly influences the classification accuracy. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an automated and reliable approach to determine the values of these parameters. In this paper, we presents the SVM parameter optimization approach using Particle swarm optimization (PSO). An important factor that influences the performance of SVM is selection of parameters. The SVM is based on multiclass classification (C-SVM) and we experimentally select 5 parameters for optimization: (kernel function: t, cost value: c, gamma value: g, degree value: d, coefficient value: r). To estimate the performance of parameter combination, we estimate the classification accuracy of each parameter combination and used 6-cross validation to estimate the accuracy of each parameter combination. Our method attempts to increase the classification accuracy. From experiment results, it can be concluded that our approach can be solve the problem of estimating the optimal SVM parameter settings.

In the first stage, nodes representing pixels are connected to their k-nearest neighbors to build a complex network with the small-world property to propagate the labels quickly. In the second stage, a regular network in a grid format is used to refine the segmentation on the object borders. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method can perform the task with high accuracy. Computer simulations are performed using some real-world images to show its effectiveness in both two-classes and multi-classes problems. It is also applied to all the images from the Microsoft GrabCut dataset for comparison, and the segmentation accuracy is comparable to those achieved by some state-of-the-art methods, while it is faster than them.

Traditional algorithms usually assume that asthma data are evenly distributed among various classes and might ignore minority classes. Therefore, an intelligent algorithm based on bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) and robust fuzzy algorithm (RFA) is applied to analyze asthma data in this paper. In the proposed algorithm, RFA with the property of robust can reduce the influence of noises or outlier. It can establish the fuzzy model and effectively analyze asthma data. For foraging theory, natural selection trends to eliminate animals with poor foraging strategies and to favor the propagation of genes for animals which have successful foraging strategies. BFO can model the mechanism of natural selection and find the best solution. Consequently, it can enhance the classification accuracy of asthma data.

Thus, how to detect those attacks at early stage has become an important and urgent topic in the cyber security community. For this purpose, recognizing C&C (Command & Control) communication between compromised bots and the C&C server becomes a crucially important issue, because C&C communication is in the preparation phase of distributed attacks. Although attack detection based on signature has been practically applied since long ago, it is well-known that it cannot efficiently deal with new kinds of attacks. In recent years, ML(Machine learning)-based detection methods have been studied widely. In those methods, feature selection is obviously very important to the detection performance. We once utilized up to 55 features to pick out C&C traffic in order to accomplish early detection of DDoS attacks. In this work, we try to answer the question that \"Are all of those features really necessary?\" We mainly investigate how the detection performance moves as the features are removed from those having lowest importance and we try to make it clear that what features should be payed attention for early detection of distributed attacks.

The current trend lies in employing a crowd of retrieved results stemming from multiple feature modalities to boost the overall performance of visual reranking. However, a major challenge pertaining to current reranking methods is how to take full advantage of the complementary property of distinct feature modalities. Given a query image and one feature modality, a regular visual reranking framework treats the top-ranked images as pseudo positive instances which are inevitably noisy, difficult to reveal this complementary property, and thus lead to inferior ranking performance. This paper proposes a novel image reranking approach by introducing a Co-Regularized Multi-Graph Learning (Co-RMGL) framework, in which the intra-graph and inter-graph constraints are simultaneously imposed to encode affinities in a single graph and consistency across different graphs. Moreover, weakly supervised learning driven by image attributes is performed to denoise the pseudo-labeled instances, thereby highlighting the unique strength of individual feature modality.

It efficiently updates a trained LS-SVM by means of incremental updating and decremental pruning algorithms whenever a sample is added to, or removed from, the training set, and robustness is improved by the use of an additional weighted LS-SVM step. This method overcomes the drawback of sparseness lost within the LS-SVM and makes LS-SVM for online system identification possible.

Consequently, data-driven estimation of these functional dependencies has a paramount importance, especially when very limited a priori knowledge is available. Existing overparametrization and nonparametric methods dedicated to nonlinear estimation offer interesting starting points for this problem, but need reformulation to be applied in the LPV setting. Moreover, most of these approaches are developed under quite restrictive auto-regressive noise assumptions. In this paper, a nonparametric Least-Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) approach is extended for the identification of LPV polynomial models. The efficiency of the approach in the considered noise setting is shown, but the drawback of the auto-regressive noise assumption is also demonstrated by a challenging LPV identification example. To preserve the attractive properties of the approach, but to overcome the drawbacks in the estimation of polynomial LPV models in a general noise setting, a recently developed Instrumental Variable (IV)-based extension of the LS-SVM method is applied.

Along with a high dimension, many of these included variables are often correlated. This can pose problems for traditional methods. Much of the time, the data cannot be utilized completely as is, but instead requires previous research to guide researchers to choose relevant predictors prior to model selection. Traditional methods such as logistic regression and mixed models cannot necessarily converge and struggle with identifiability when the number of measurements collected approach or become larger than the number of patients in the study. Machine-learning techniques, including Random Forests and the newly developed Fuzzy Forests method, can accommodate data with high dimensionality. We concentrate on decision trees in particular because of their relative ease of use, availability and predictive ability. Random Forest is a widely used, parallelizable and computationally efficient method; however it does not acknowledge any correlation between variables leading to a preference for correlated predictors. Fuzzy Forest, on the other hand, explicitly explores the correlation structure among the variables, leading to unbiased variable importance measures. Fuzzy Forest, along with Random Forest, is utilized in three applications; smoking cessation in health care workers, re-arrest among homeless ex-offenders and genetic predictors of lithium response in individuals with Bipolar disorder.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2972988024", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:203141551"}

In this paper we propose a new method for prioritizing disease genes using both annotations on the genes as well as the underlying gene interaction network.

In view of the characteristics of the coal mine water disaster rescue system that the system is complicated, the data acquisition is difficult, we propose a forecasting model of the stability of the coal mine water disasters emergency rescue system based on improved particle swarm optimization and support vector machine. 1. The index system of coal mine water disaster rescue organization system stability Coal mine water disaster rescue is a complex dynamic system involving humanmachine environment, engineering technology, and other elements, in order to improve the reaction efficiency and the quality of crisis management of coal mine, we take management of the stability of coal mine water disaster rescue system to measure the stability of coal mine rescue organization system and to improve the organizational system and to lay a solid foundation for the rescue work.

The establishment of prediction model of coal mine water disaster rescue organization system stability There is a vague, non-linear relationship between the mine water disaster rescue organization system stability and affecting factors, the support vector machine with strict theoretical basis has a distinct advantage to solve the problem of nonlinear, high dimension and small sample: less data sample demand, high accuracy and strong adaptability, effective way to avoid the curse of dimensionality, etc. Therefore, the support vector machine water is introduced into the coal mine disaster relief organization system stability prediction, while selecting SVM kernel function and parameter as a breakthrough for in-depth study. 2.1 Basic learning method of support vector machines (SVM) Vapnik [4] proposed the concept of kernel functions about SVM nonlinear classification surface problems, the basic idea is: a pre-determined by non-linear mapping of the input vector x is mapped to a high-dimensional space, then this high-dimensional space constructed optimal classification surface.

The approach includes two modules, i.e. spotting and recognition. In the spotting module, a continuous gesture sequence is segmented into individual gesture intervals based on hand joint positions within a sliding window. In the recognition module, three models are combined to classify each gesture interval into one gesture category. For skeletal model, Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are adopted for classifying skeleton features. For depth maps and user masks, we employ 2D Motion Trail Model (2DMTM) for gesture representation to capture motion region information. SVM is then used to classify Pyramid Histograms of Oriented Gradient (PHOG) features from 2DMTM. These three models are complementary to each other. Finally, a fusion scheme incorporates the probability weights of each classifier for gesture recognition. The proposed approach is evaluated on the 2014 ChaLearn Multi-modal Gesture Recognition Challenge dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach using combined models outperforms single-modal approaches, and the recognition module can perform effectively on user-independent gesture recognition.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-16178-5_44", "venue": "ECCV Workshops", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1148721823", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["5388357", "9459416", "961425", "2930761", "1956774", "202122", "578111", "110497751", "59942950", "10087484", "3148797", "9772401", "4333408", "14561742", "17234084", "6482700", "13618539", "1087061", "61962167", "17190794", "11964979", "6242337", "11061616", "14324479", "14239485", "13831054", "12766937", "13609995", "14368996"], "inbound_citations": ["3941847", "4247866", "11300635", "8367518", "153314276", "15423876", "16892152", "20193702", "10019533"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1880658"}

Calibration images from a previous experimental study were used to train the Random Forest model and the output was compared to the results from a high resolution pixel-wise methodology. The Random Forest model provided a trade-off in accuracy with increased efficiency and reduced sensitivity to image desynchronisation when compared to the pixel-wise method. The reduced accuracy was attributed in part to non-linear lighting distribution across the sandbox, which could be corrected by orientating the backlights effectively.

To accomplish our study goals, we presented cafeteria-style feeding trials of fresh food items collected in the home range of wild black snub-nosed monkeys to the only two captive R. strykeri, and compared the nutritional profiles of the leafy foods (buds, young, and mature leaves, 100 i23tems from 70 plant species) selected with those avoided (54 items from 48 plant species). Overall, the results indicate that captive R. strykeri selected foods that were higher in moisture (Mo; 77.7%), crude protein (CP; 21.2%), total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC; 34.9%), and phosphorus (P; 0.37%) while tending to avoid foods with a neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content of greater than 46.8%. Leaves collected in autumn and selected by the monkeys were characterized by a slightly higher amount of metabolizable energy (ME) than those rejected (1,350 kJ/100 g vs. 1,268 kJ/100 g).

There were many researches about e-cigarette and cigarette that mostly focused on finding and analyzing causes of smoking using conventional statistics. However, there is a lack of research on developing prediction models, which is more applicable to anti-smoking campaign, about e-cigarette and cigarette. In this paper, we research the prediction models that can be used to predict an individual e-cigarette user's (including non-e-cigarette users) intention to smoke cigarettes, so that one can be early informed about the risk of going down the path of smoking cigarettes. To construct the prediction models, five machine learning (ML) algorithms are exploited and tested for their accuracy in predicting the intention to smoke cigarettes among never smokers using data from the 2018 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS). In our investigation, the Gradient Boosting Classifier, one of the prediction models, shows the highest accuracy out of all the other models. Also, with the best prediction model, we made a public website that enables users to input information to predict their intentions of smoking cigarettes.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": "1910.12748", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2981594875", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["12953668", "43388283", "892445", "19067649", "82294758", "9375292", "19393383", "35665520", "2143923", "51625247", "46778677", "4488020", "13780662", "13782746", "42169857", "6692916", "17793133", "13252401", "1825515", "608", "31039418", "7415435", "14669208", "63751177"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204904220"}

The lack of a sufficient amount of labelled hate speech data, along with the existing biases, has been the main issue in this domain of research. To address these needs, in this study we introduce a novel transfer learning approach based on an existing pre-trained language model called BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). More specifically, we investigate the ability of BERT at capturing hateful context within social media content by using new fine-tuning methods based on transfer learning. To evaluate our proposed approach, we use two publicly available datasets that have been annotated for racism, sexism, hate, or offensive content on Twitter. The results show that our solution obtains considerable performance on these datasets in terms of precision and recall in comparison to existing approaches.

However, studies in neurophysiology have revealed that EEG signals carry information in different ranges of frequency components. To better reflect these multi-frequency properties in EEGs, we propose a novel deep multi-scale neural network that discovers feature representations in multiple frequency/time ranges and extracts relationships among electrodes, i.e., spatial representations, for subject intention/condition identification. Furthermore, by completely representing EEG signals with spatio-spectral-temporal information, the proposed method can be utilized for diverse paradigms in both active and passive BCIs, contrary to existing methods that are primarily focused on single-paradigm BCIs. To demonstrate the validity of our proposed method, we conducted experiments on various paradigms of active/passive BCI datasets. Our experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method achieved performance improvements when judged against comparable state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we analyzed the proposed method using different techniques, such as PSD curves and relevance score inspection to validate the multi-scale EEG signal information capturing ability, activation pattern maps for investigating the learned spatial filters, and t-SNE plotting for visualizing represented features.

Remote sensing allows air temperature to be estimated on a spatially distributed basis, thus complementing the spatially sparse obser- vations collected by ground micro-meteorological stations. In this paper, a novel approach to periodic (e.g., daily or monthly) air temperature estimation from satellite images based on sup- port vector machines (SVMs) is proposed. A recently developed SVM-based approach to supervised land and sea surface tem- perature estimation using satellite images is generalized to the case of air temperature and integrated with case-specific tech- niques aimed at computing periodic statistics of air temperature using the expectation-maximization algorithm. The method is fully automated and allows the statistics of the estimation error to be modeled on a pixelwise basis. This last result is accom- plished by combining nonstationary multidimensional stochastic processes and Clark's variance approximation. The method is experimentally validated with MSG-SEVIRI data acquired over Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur (France).

In this study, I adopt a bi-objective optimization (BOO) approach and propose a two-stage method using support vector machine (SVM) and support vector regression (SVR) to maximize response rate and profit simultaneously. To deal with the difficulty of learning models from imbalanced data, synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) is used to generate more balanced datasets. Experiments are conducted on two datasets, a direct marketing dataset and the KDD-98 dataset, to compare the predictive performance of the two-stage BOOSVM with other benchmark methods including logistic regression and the parallel Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA). The results of decile analysis suggest that the proposed two-stage BOOSVM model with SMOTE method is more effective and efficient than the competing models in improving response rate and profitability.

With virtually no success at finding pharmaceutical therapeutics for altering progressive AD after diagnosis, research attention is increasingly directed at discovering biological and other markers that detect AD risk in the long asymptomatic phase. Both early detection and precision preclinical intervention require systematic investigation of multiple modalities and combinations of AD-related biomarkers and risk factors. We extend recent unbiased metabolomics research that produced a set of metabolite biomarker panels tailored to the discrimination of cognitively normal, cognitively impaired and AD patients. Specifically, we compare the prediction importance of these panels with five other sets of modifiable and non-modifiable AD risk factors (genetic, lifestyle, cognitive, functional health, and bio-demographic) in three clinical groups. Method: The three groups were: Cognitively Normal (CN; n = 35), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI; n = 25), and AD (n = 22). In a series of three pairwise comparisons, we used machine learning technology (Random Forest Analysis, RFA) to test relative predictive importance of up to 19 risk biomarkers from the six AD risk domains. Results: The three RFA multimodal prediction analyses produced significant discriminating risk factors. First, discriminating AD from CN was the AD metabolite panel and two cognitive markers. Second, discriminating AD from MCI was the AD/MCI metabolite panel and two cognitive markers. Third, discriminating MCI from CN was the MCI metabolite panel and seven markers from four other risk modalities: genetic, lifestyle, cognition, and functional health. Conclusions: Salivary metabolomics biomarker panels, supplemented by other risk markers, were robust predictors of (1) clinical differences in impairment and dementia and even (2) subtle differences between CN and MCI.

The meteoric rise of online social media and the increasing significance of public opinion expressed therein have opened doors to many challenges as well as opportunities for this research. The challenges have been articulated in the literature through a growing list of sentiment analysis problems and tasks, while the opportunities are constantly being availed with the introduction of new algorithms and techniques for solving them. However, these approaches often remain out of the direct reach of other researchers, who have to either rely on benchmark datasets, which are not always available, or be inventive with their comparisons. This thesis presents Sentiment Analysis Research Environment (SARE), an extendable and publicly-accessible system designed with the goal of integrating baseline and state of- the-art approaches to solving sentiment analysis problems. Since covering the entire breadth of the field is beyond the scope of this work, the usefulness of this environment is demonstrated by integrating solutions for certain facets of the aspect-based sentiment analysis problem. Currently, the system provides a semi-automatic method to support building gold-standard lexica, an automatic baseline method for extracting aspect expressions, and a pre-existing baseline sentiment analysis engine. Users are assisted in creating gold-standard lexica by applying our proposed set cover approximation algorithm, which finds a significantly reduced set of documents needed to create a lexicon. We also suggest a baseline semi-supervised aspect expression extraction algorithm based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to automatically extract aspect expressions.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2624706964", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:64987081"}

However, sparse and uneven spatial distribution of the temperature gauging stations introduces remarkable uncertainties into analysis of the SAT pattern. From a geo-intelligent perspective, here we proposed a new SAT reconstruction method based on the multisource data and machine learning technique which was developed by considering autocorrelation of the in situ observed SAT in both space and time, or simply STAML, i.e. Geoi-SVM (Geo-Intelligent Support Vector Machine), Geoi-BPNN (Geo-Intelligent Back Propagation Neural Network) and Geoi-RF (Geo-Intelligent Random Forest). The multisource data used in this study include the in situ observed SAT and multisource remotely sensed data such as MODIS land surface temperature, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data. Intermodel comparisons amidst reconstructed SAT data were done to evaluate reconstructing performance of abovementioned models. Besides, the SAT reconstructed by CART (Classification and Regression Tree) was also included to evaluate the reconstructing performance of the models considered in this study when compared to SAT data by CART algorithm. We found that the estimation error of the reconstructed SAT by the STAML is smaller than 0.5 K (Kelvin). In addition, it is interesting to note that the Geoi-RF performs better with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of lower than 0.25 K, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Standard Deviation (SD) of lower than 0.5 K respectively. Correlation coefficients between the reconstructed SAT by Geoi-RF and the observed SAT are close to 1. Besides, the estimation accuracy of the SAT by the Geoi-RF technique is 18.51\u201363.17% higher than that by the other techniques considered in this study.

Novel method of feature selection is introduced. Feature selection for a particular SVM is done based on the beats to be classified by that SVM. ECG signals are obtained from the open source MIT-BIH cardiac arrhythmia database. 6355 beats (2036 LBB, 3865 N, 454 PVC) are used for testing the implementation.

Large pharmacogenomic data sets were introduced to discover more of these single-gene markers of drug sensitivity. Very recently, machine learning regression has been used to investigate how well cancer cell line sensitivity to drugs is predicted depending on the type of molecular profile. The latter has revealed that gene expression data is the most predictive profile in the pan-cancer setting. However, no study to date has exploited GDSC data to systematically compare the performance of machine learning models based on multi-gene expression data against that of widely-used single-gene markers based on genomics data. Methods: Here we present this systematic comparison using Random Forest (RF) classifiers exploiting the expression levels of 13,321 genes and an average of 501 tested cell lines per drug. To account for time-dependent batch effects in IC 50 measurements, we employ independent test sets generated with more recent GDSC data than that used to train the predictors and show that this is a more realistic validation than K-fold cross-validation. Results and Discussion: Across 127 GDSC drugs, our results show that the single-gene markers unveiled by the MANOVA analysis tend to achieve higher precision than these RF-based multi-gene models, at the cost of generally having a poor recall (i.e. correctly detecting only a small part of the cell lines sensitive to the drug). Regarding overall classification performance, about two thirds of the drugs are better predicted by multi-gene RF classifiers. Among the drugs with the most predictive of these models, we found pyrimethamine, sunitinib and 17-AAG. Conclusions: We now know that this type of models can predict in vitro tumour response to these drugs. These models can thus be further investigated on in vivo tumour models.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5310525", "pubmed_id": "28299173", "doi": "10.12688/f1000research.10529.1", "venue": "F1000Research", "journal": "F1000Research", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["43000329"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:56184614"}

In particular, the usefulness of different task pairs is not known a priori. Practically, this means that properly combining the losses of different tasks becomes a critical issue in multi-task learning, as different methods may yield different results. In this paper, we benchmarked different multi-task learning approaches using shared trunk with task specific branches architecture across three different MTL datasets.

Radar images and simultaneous rain rate data collected from a sea trial in North Atlantic Ocean are utilized for model training and testing. Comparison with the zero pixel percentage (ZPP) threshold method shows that the SVM-based method obtains higher detection accuracy, with 98.4% for the Decca radar data and 99.7% for the Furuno radar. It is also found that as the total number of bins does not significantly affect detection accuracy, the proposed method can be applied to different radar systems directly with a suitable number of bins.

We define a subjective features as a characteristic of the data that is not dependent on an objective or self-contained measure. This method is meant to act as a tool for domain experts or as an auxiliary function for deep learning classifiers. The morphological features extracted are lobe size, hot spot/peak brightness, the number of lobes present and the Fanaroff- Riley (FR) ratio, with the latter two viewed as objective features and the rest subjective features. To determine the relevance of the morphological features as indicators of class differences, the features are then used in several machine learning classifiers, of which the study compares the classification accuracy and F1-score. Overall, the Random Forest classifier produces the highest accuracy (94.66%) and F1-score (0.94) using all the features in conjunction.

Grammatical inference provides principled methods for developing computationally sound algorithms that learn structure from strings of symbols. The relationship to computational linguistics is natural because many research problems in computational linguistics are learning problems on words, phrases, and sentences: What algorithm can take as input some finite amount of data (for instance a corpus, annotated or otherwise) and output a system that behaves \"correctly\" on specific tasks? Throughout the text, the key concepts of grammatical inference are interleaved with illustrative examples drawn from problems in computational linguistics. Special attention is paid to the notion of \"learning bias.\" In the context of computational linguistics, such bias can be thought to reflect common (ideally universal) properties of natural languages. This bias can be incorporated either by identifying a learnable class of languages which contains the language to be learned or by using particular strategies for optimizing parameter values. Examples are drawn largely from two linguistic domains (phonology and syntax) which span major regions of the Chomsky Hierarchy (from regular to context-sensitive classes).

A textual corpus is represented as a sparse words co-occurrences matrix. Then, the matrix can be factorized, for example using SVD, which allows to obtain a shorter matrix with dense and continuous vectors. To help SVD, PMI measure is applied on the initial co-occurrence matrix, assigning a relevant weight to the co-occurrences by normalizing them using both the considered words frequencies. In this paper, we follow this idea to study if weighted networks can benefit from pre-processing that can help community detection. We first design a benchmark using LFR networks. Then, we consider PMI and another NLP inspired measure as a preprocessing of the links weights, and show that PMI worsens the results while the other one improves them. By distinguishing links inside communities and links between communities into two classes, we show that this is due to the weights distributions of these links. Links between communities are in average bigger, leading to bigger values of PMI. From this analysis, we design another set of experiments that show that it is possible to classify efficiently links into these two classes, using a small set of features. Finally, we introduce the Supervised Label Propagation (SLP) algorithm that takes into account the classification results during the propagation.

The responsibility of the Incident Commander (IC) is to (I) specify an effective strategy composed of a number of threads (a set of prioritized sub-problems), (II) appropriately assign/allocate agents to these threads as a strategic decision, and (III) release agents in a timely manner from the assigned threads to adapt a strategic decision to a new situation. Objective: The purpose of this paper is to present an intelligent algorithm that assists a human in multi-agent coordination by providing two key functions: 1) automatically calculate and present a set of feasible alternatives for selecting a choice as a strategic decision in a definite time, and 2) autonomously and in a timely manner identify a subset of assigned agents that should be released from their threads in order to refine a strategic decision. Method: This algorithm expands a decision tree from a state node in which a thread (or several threads) has received a set of new agents from either the IC or a higher thread. Each thread is associated with one level of a decision tree with a number of nodes. A thread calculates a set of efficient coalitions using all the available agents and generates a new node for each coalition to show what agents are allocated to the thread and what agents are released into a lower thread. In real-time, this algorithm continuously observes and monitors the task environment to identify a subset of the assigned agents that cannot provide efficient capabilities for their threads and should be released for assignment to other threads. Results: To gather further insight, this paper applied this algorithm for team coordination to a simulated search & rescue scenario in an earthquake disaster-affected area where the team's goal was to rescue trapped people distributed in five operational zones. The result was an infinite set of alternative scenarios for a human-defined strategy.

Accordingly, a so-called reliability index may be used as a measure to assess the vehicle safe functioning. In the reliability method, computing the maximum of LTR requires to predict the vehicle dynamics over the bend which can be in some cases an intractable problem or time-consuming.

All these large amount of astronomical data must be efficiently handled. The use of machine learning algorithms and other automatic classification strategies becomes essential in such a big data frame. The main objective of this master thesis consists to prepare and tested an efficient automatize machine learning algorithm. Five supervised models are considered in this work, becoming the Random Forest algorithm the model that present the best capabilities and performance. We will take advantage of a detailed simulator of the white dwarf population, provided by the Astronomy and Astrophysics Group of the Physics Department of the UPC. This simulator will provide us with a detailed synthetic population that will mimic the characteristic of the observed population of white dwarfs by Gaia. This synthetic population will be used in the learning stage of the Random Forest Algorithm, in order to optimize its implementation to the observed data. Once tested, our algorithm has been applied to the extracted data from available Gaia Data Releases in order to classify its content in the different subpopulations of Galaxy such as the halo or the disk.

To address this issue, we propose a robust keypoint tracker based on spatio-temporal multi-task structured output optimization driven by discriminative metric learning. Consequently, temporal model coherence is characterized by multi-task structured keypoint model learning over several adjacent frames, while spatial model consistency is modeled by solving a geometric verification based structured learning problem.

To detect a speed-limit sign, we first choose the candidate regions for a speed-limit sign using the border color and apply sliding windows to the candidate regions using a two-class boosted random forest (BoostRF) classifier instead of simple random forest. To reduce the computational cost for the image pyramid, the optimal levels of scaling using the search area is adapted.

Moreover, an accurate prediction of the user next position (even with a short advice) may open a number of new AAL applications that could timely provide the right services in the right place even before the user request them. However, the problem of forecasting the user position is complicated due to the intrinsic difficulty of localization in indoor environments, and to the fact that different paths of the user may intersect at a given point, but they may end in different places. We tackle with this problem by modeling the localization information stream obtained from a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) using Recurrent Neural Networks implemented as efficient Echo State Networks (ESNs), within the Reservoir Computing paradigm. In particular, we have set up an experimental test-bed in which the WSN produces localization information of a user that moves along a number of different paths, and in which the ESN collects localization information to predict a future position of the user at some given mark points.

The proposed algorithm SOINN-AML is composed based on the Self-organizing Incremental Neural Network (Shen et al 2006), which represents the distribution of unlabeled data and reports a reasonable number of clusters. SOINN adopts a competitive Hebbian rule for each input signal, and distance between nodes is measured using the Euclidean distance. Such algorithms rely on the distance metric for the input data patterns. Distance Metric Learning (DML) learns a distance metric for the high dimensional input space of data that preserves the distance relation among the training data. DML is not performed for input space of data in SOINN based approaches. SOINN-AML learns input space of data by using the Adaptive Distance Metric Learning (AML) algorithm which is one of the DML algorithms. It improves the incremental clustering performance of the SOINN algorithm by optimizing the distance metric in the case that input data space is high dimensional. In experimental results, we evaluate the performance by using two artificial datasets, seven real datasets from the UCI dataset and three real image datasets. We have found that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional algorithms including SOINN (Shen et al 2006) and Enhanced SOINN (Shen et al 2007).

Here, we explore how the misexpression of chromatin regulators\u2014factors involved in the establishment and maintenance of functional chromatin domains\u2014can inform about the extent of docetaxel response. We exploit Affymetrix and NanoString gene expression data for a set of chromatin regulators generated from breast cancer patient-derived xenograft models and patient samples treated with docetaxel. Random Forest classification reveals specific panels of chromatin regulators, including key components of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler, which readily distinguish docetaxel high-responders and poor-responders. Further exploration of SWI/SNF components in the comprehensive NCI-60 dataset reveals that the expression inversely correlates with docetaxel sensitivity. Finally, we show that loss of the SWI/SNF subunit BRG1 (SMARCA4) in a model cell line leads to enhanced docetaxel sensitivity. Altogether, our findings point toward chromatin regulators as biomarkers for drug response as well as therapeutic targets to sensitize patients toward docetaxel and combat drug resistance.

The present calculated results are consistent with the experimental values, which suggest that the proposed LSSVM model is feasible and efficient and is therefore considerd to be a promising alternative method to forecast the variation of the hardness and electrical conductivity with aging temperature and aging time.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.813.479", "venue": null, "journal": "Advanced Materials Research", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1985590909", "mag_field_of_study": ["Materials Science"], "outbound_citations": ["53940663"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:109850804"}

Past efforts focused on finding tight bounds of loo (e.g., radius margin bounds, span bounds). However, their practical viability is still not very satisfactory. Duan, Keerthi, and Poo (2003) showed that radius margin bound gives good prediction for L2-SVM, one of the cases we look at. In this letter, through analyses about why this bound performs well for L2-SVM, we show that finding a bound whose minima are in a region with small loo values may be more important than its tightness. Based on this principle, we propose modified radius margin bounds for L1-SVM (the other case) where the original bound is applicable only to the hard-margin case. Our modification for L1-SVM achieves comparable performance to L2-SVM. To study whether L1- or L2-SVM should be used, we analyze other properties, such as their differentiability, number of support vectors, and number of free support vectors. In this aspect, L1-SVM possesses the advantage of having fewer support vectors.

In ElasticChain, the duplicate ratio regulation algorithm makes two things happen. The first one is to give a safe distribution of duplicates and then the other thing is the duplicates are stored in highly reliable nodes. However, in ElasticChain, the reliability test method of storage nodes is too simple. Therefore, in order to solve this problem, it is necessary for us to put forward an optimized data distribution method for ElasticChain. The optimized model ought be able to use the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) to classify the nodes because of their different reliability. Moreover, the optimized model can also distribute the blockchain data in reliable nodes, so as to increase data security. Further, we brought forward a new strategy to extract the node reliability.

These regulations require that growers apply nitrogen to meet, but not exceed, the annual N demand for crop and tree growth and nut production. To accurately predict seasonal nitrogen demand, therefore, growers need to estimate block-level almond yield early in the growing season so that timely N management decisions can be made. However, methods to predict almond yield are not currently available. To fill this gap, we have developed statistical models using the Stochastic Gradient Boosting, a machine learning approach, for early season yield projection and mid-season yield update over individual orchard blocks. We collected yield records of 185 orchards, dating back to 2005, from the major almond growers in the Central Valley of California. A large set of variables were extracted as predictors, including weather and orchard characteristics from remote sensing imagery. Our results showed that the predicted orchard-level yield agreed well with the independent yield records. For both the early season (March) and mid-season (June) predictions, a coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0.71, and a ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ) of 2.6 were found on average. We also identified several key determinants of yield based on the modeling results. Almond yield increased dramatically with the orchard age until about 7 years old in general, and the higher long-term mean maximum temperature during April-June enhanced the yield in the southern orchards, while a larger amount of precipitation in March reduced the yield, especially in northern orchards. Remote sensing metrics such as annual maximum vegetation indices were also dominant variables for predicting the yield potential. While these results are promising, further refinement is needed; the availability of larger data sets and incorporation of additional variables and methodologies will be required for the model to be used as a fertilization decision support tool for growers.

This paper investigate a class of CTSP, called serial CTSP (S-CTSP). Each of its salesmen has his exclusive cities and shares some cities with its neighbor(s) in a serial manner. It can be used to model the scheduling problem of multimachine engineering systems with linearly arranged machines. S-CTSP is NP-hard. Developing effective and efficient approaches to S-CTSP is important to enable its industrial applications. This paper presents a population-based incremental learning (PBIL) approach to it. After analyzing its solution space, we set up some probability matrix models to guide the individual search of the algorithm. Then, a distance penalty is introduced into the state transfer function that can select the cities with small penalty values by the Roulette method to form a good route. By adding a powerful local search operation, 2-opt, to the algorithm, we can further enhance its search ability. Extensive simulation is conducted and its results show that the augmented PBIL is effective and well outperforms the genetic algorithms and CPLEX.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TSMC.2016.2591267", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2497712405", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["27125383", "122341161", "18751367", "41417262", "31161011", "36465366", "44857442", "61819893", "119665544", "23679146", "4942030", "454072", "22017645", "14710615", "14799233", "117776882", "63602602", "17878268", "1381570", "13281625", "25198270", "123646893", "109956848", "111337860", "2336304", "16235953", "14275698", "37721535", "45670164", "19710619", "14652781", "11742937", "12258478", "22048771", "4639363", "13368651", "16903978", "23205651", "51693403"], "inbound_citations": ["212636089", "125755176", "195832899", "117613784", "86480310", "81981777", "208263286", "203156352", "23205651", "3921883", "6302295", "201131691", "209382725", "117237036"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5839181"}

We know di.erent approaches have been proposed for incorporating probabilities, some unusual search methods have been developed and a few techniques for concurrent processing have been investigated. But can we do things now that we could not five years ago (or at least, could do so only with great di.culty then)?

In particular, the prediction of energy consumption in building is essential for the energy operator to build an optimal operating strategy, which could be integrated to building's energy management system (BEMS). This paper proposes a prediction model for building energy consumption using support vector machine (SVM). Data-driven model, for instance, SVM is very sensitive to the selection of training data. Thus the relevant days data selection method based on Dynamic Time Warping is used to train SVM model. In addition, to encompass thermal inertia of building, pseudo dynamic model is applied since it takes into account information of transition of energy consumption effects and occupancy profile. Relevant days data selection and whole training data model is applied to the case studies of Ecole des Mines de Nantes, France Office building. The results showed that support vector machine based on relevant data selection method is able to predict the energy consumption of building with a high accuracy in compare to whole data training. In addition, relevant data selection method is computationally cheaper (around 8 minute training time) in contrast to whole data training (around 31 hour for weekend and 116 hour for working days) and reveals realistic control implementation for online system as well.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": "1507.05019", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2953332020,2963614871,2206413940", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["108727333", "110838712", "109524943", "109121777", "108453813", "35662478", "58907837", "14196870", "7094820", "11090972", "7470291", "207056701", "15459268", "7154770", "961425", "14053104", "60502900", "7138354"], "inbound_citations": ["211227349", "210693226", "53228568", "85500449", "214595191"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16380733"}

For this purpose, urban slum areas as well as surrounding land resources should be well identified and classified so that the existing land resources can be appropriately utilized for future implementation of development activities.

Diagnosis is often inaccurate, based on self-report and is largely under-diagnosed. Data-driven approaches to predict lifetime risk for MDD and single versus recurrent MDD, especially using a small number of highly-accurate predictors that could be easily collected in clinic, would be a step forward in realising the promises of personalised medicine. We applied machine learning algorithms (MLAs) to the Generation Scotland cohort study (N > 21,000), a deeply-phenotyped cohort. The cohort was first divided into a training (63%) and held-out test (37%) set for both lifetime and single versus recurrent MDD analyses. Methods In the training set, 10-fold cross-validation was used to estimate optimal hyperparameters for the following algorithms: Random Forest, Conditional Inference Forest, Gradient Descent Boosting (GBM), Support Vector Machines (with linear, polynomial and radial basis function kernels), Neural Networks, C5.0, Elastic Net and Forward Stepwise Regression. Using the optimal hyperparameters, we ran each MLA on the full training set, then ran the independent test data through the best model derived from the training data to predict case-control or single-recurrent status. Receiving Operator Characteristic Area Under the Curve (AUC) values were used to assess performance of the algorithms on the test data. To obtain a reduced set of predictors with optimised predictive value, the Markov Chain 4 (MC4) algorithm was used. MC4 is a rank aggregation algorithm, originally designed for meta-Internet search rankings. The aggregated rankings of predictors across all MLAs were then used to determine the smallest set with equal or better predictive value on the test data versus using all of the predictors. Results AUC values for the prediction of lifetime MDD were in the range of 0.81\u20130.84 for all MLAs; similarly, the AUC range for single versus recurrent MDD were between 0.69 and 0.76. All AUCs were significantly better than expected by chance (AUC = 0.5). Using the MC4 ranked variables and the best-performing model (GBM), we found that equal performance was obtained using only 20 variables for lifetime MDD (AUC = 0.84) compared to 155 variables in the full set, and 10 for single versus recurrent MDD (AUC = 0.76) compared to 180 variables in the full set. Discussion The MC4 ranked subsets performed equally well to the full subset, although it is likely other subsets exist that could perform similarly. The subsets identified for lifetime MDD included neuroticism, general psychological distress, age, income, family history of depression, living alone, sex, home ownership, smoking, education, pain status, mania and schizotypy. Age at MDD onset, neuroticism, psychological distress, measures of cognition, age, smoking and home ownership were the most relevant predictors for whether someone would have a single episode of MDD or recurrent episodes. These highly-predictive questionnaires and demographic information can be easily collected in clinic to assist in accurate diagnosis and preventative treatment for recurrent MDD.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.euroneuro.2017.08.024", "venue": "European Neuropsychopharmacology", "journal": "European Neuropsychopharmacology", "mag_id": "2923190808", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:85495926"}

In contrast of the AR applications on smart phones or tablets, the Head-Up-Displays (HUD) technology based on a part or all wind-shield project information directly into the field of vision, so the driver does not have to look down at the instrument which maybe causes to the time-critical event misses. Until now, the HUD designers try to show not only basic information such as speed and navigation commands but also the aids and the annotations that help the driver to see potential dangers. However, what should be displayed and when it has to be displayed are still always the questions in critical driving context. In another context, the pedestrian safety becomes a serious society problem when half of traffic accidents around the world are among pedestrians and cyclists. Several advanced Pedestrian Collision Warning Systems (PCWS) have been proposed to detect pedestrians using the on-board sensors and to inform the driver of their presences. However, most of these systems do not adapt to the driver\u2019s state and can become extremely distracting and annoying when they detect pedestrian. For those reasons, this thesis focuses on proposing a new concept for the PCWS using AR (so called the AR-PCW system). Firstly, for the \u00abWhen\u00bb question, the display decision has to take into account the driver\u2019s states and the critical situations. Therefore, we investigate the modelisation of the driver\u2019s awareness of a pedestrian (DAP) and the driver\u2019s unawareness of a pedestrian (DUP). In order to do that, an experimental approach is proposed to observe and to collect the driving data that present the DAP and the DUP. Then, the feature-based algorithms, the data-driven models based on the discriminative models (e.g. Support Vector Machine) or the generative models (e.g. Hidden Markov Model) are proposed to recognize the DAP and the DUP. Secondly, for the \u00abWhat\u00bb question, our proposition is inspired by the state-of-the-art on the AR in the driving context. The dynamic bounding-box surrounding the pedestrian and the static danger panel are used as the visual aids. Finally, in this thesis, we study experimentally the benefits and the costs of the proposed AR-PCW system and the effects of the aids on the driver. A fixed-based driving simulator is used. A limited display zone on screen is proposed to simulate the HUD. Twenty five healthy middle-aged licensed drivers in ambiguous driving scenarios are explored. Indeed, the heading-car following is used as the main driving task whereas twenty three pedestrians appear in the circuit at different moment and with different behaviors. The car-follow task performance and the awareness of pedestrian are then accessed through the driver actions. The objective results as well as the subjective results show that the visual aids can enhance the driver\u2019s awareness of a pedestrian which is defined with three levels: perception, vigilance and anticipation.

Additional criticisms of prototype theory that also apply to connectionist models are then considered. These criticisms have deeper implications for our theories of conceptual structure.

One great threat to VANETs is Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack because the target of this attack is to prevent authorized nodes from accessing the services. To provide high availability of VANETs, a scalable, reliable and robust network intrusion detection system should be developed to efficiently mitigate DDoS. However, big data from VANETs poses serious challenges to DDoS attack detection since the detection system require scalable methods to capture, store and process the big data. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a distributed DDoS network intrusion detection system based on big data technology. The proposed detection system consists of two main components: real-time network traffic collection module and network traffic detection module. To build our proposed system, we use Spark to speed up data processing and use HDFS to store massive suspicious attacks. In the network collection module, micro-batch data processing model is used to improve the real-time performance of traffic feature collection. In the traffic detection module, the classification algorithm based on Random Forest (RF) is adopted.

Virtual screening is a computational method for finding an efficient drug molecule from pool of potential candidates. There are two different methods for virtual screening 1) structure based 2) ligand based. In the structure based method, 2D or 3D structure of a target molecule is used to screen the ligands which do not bind to the target molecule. Ligand based virtual screening is based on the fact that ligands similar to an active drug molecule might be active. The amount of information required is different in both the case. Structure based virtual screening is computationally intensive and complex while a few active ligand information is enough to start ligand based virtual screening. Based on the type of information, ligand based virtual screening can be performed in different ways. The machine learning approach using molecular graphs has been found to be very effective. Graph kernel is the similarity measure used to screen molecular graphs based on the structure. It is based on the fact that structurally similar molecules will have same property. In this review we have summarized the recent development in graph kernel for chemical molecule and elaborated upon the need of more accurate and efficient graph kernel with less computational complexity. The accuracy of different methods have been compared using standard dataset. The review shows the current state of art in the ongoing research in the design of efficient walk kernels.

A reservoir computing system consists of a reservoir for mapping inputs into a high-dimensional space and a readout for pattern analysis from the high-dimensional states in the reservoir. The reservoir is fixed and only the readout is trained with a simple method such as linear regression and classification. Thus, the major advantage of reservoir computing compared to other recurrent neural networks is fast learning, resulting in low training cost. Another advantage is that the reservoir without adaptive updating is amenable to hardware implementation using a variety of physical systems, substrates, and devices. In fact, such physical reservoir computing has attracted increasing attention in diverse fields of research.

This paper proposes a novel model named Traffic Anomaly Classification based on Hierarchical Clustering(TACHC). It utilizes the learning process of its feature attributes to establish classification tree gradually and the similar anomaly is embedded in the subtree. The classification tree classifies new anomalies with the number of clusters unknown. Experimental results show that the classification accuracy of TACHC algorithm reaches 89%, and the classification accuracy of anomalies with low traffic volumes such as network scan reaches 95.3 %.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Computer Engineering", "mag_id": "2370690154", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["86475835"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:63958591"}
{"paper_id": "108123017", "title": "The enhanced group method of data handling models for time series forecasting", "authors": [{"first": "Ruhaidah", "middle": [], "last": "Samsudin", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Time series forecasting is an active research area that has drawn most attention for applications in various fields such as engineering, finance, economic, and science. Despite the numerous time series models available, the research to improve the effectiveness of forecasting models especially for time series forecasting accuracy still continues. Several research of commonly used time series forecasting models had concluded that hybrid forecasts from more than one model often led to improved performance. Recently, one sub-model of neural network, the Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) and several hybrid models based on GMDH method have been proposed for time series forecasting. They have been successfully applied in diverse applications such as data mining and knowledge discovery, forecasting and systems modeling, optimization and pattern recognition. However, to produce accurate results, these hybrid models require more complex network generating architecture. In addition, several types and parameters of transfer function must be predetermined and modified. Thus, in this study, two enhancements of GMDH models were proposed to alleviate the problems inherent with the GMDH algorithms. The first model was the modification of conventional GMDH method called MGMD. The second model was an enhancement of MGMDH model named HMGMDH, in order to overcome the shortcomings of MGMDH model that did not perform well in uncertainty type of data. The proposed models were then applied to forecast two real data sets (tourism demand and river flow data) and three well-known benchmarked data sets. The statistical performance measurement was utilized to evaluate the performance of the two afore-mentioned models. It was found that average accuracy of MGMDH compared to GMDH in term of R, MAE, and MSE value increased by 1.27 %, 10.96%, and 16.9%, respectively. Similarly, for HMGMDH model, the average accuracy in term of R, MAE, and MSE value also increased by 1.39%, 14.05%, 24.28%, respectively. Hence, these two models provided a simple architecture that led to more accurate results when compared to existing time-series forecasting models. The performance accuracy of these models were also compared with Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) and Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) models. The results of the comparison indicated that the proposed models could be considered as a useful tool and a promising new method for time series forecasting.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "186051196", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:108123017"}

Different from decision tree, random forest uses a combination of classification trees instead of a single tree to construct random forest model. This model can improve the average performances in traffic incident detection just by voting the decision tree classifiers. Two experiments are performed to investigate the potential application of random forest to traffic incident detection from the perspective of classification strength and correlation. Random forest trains many individual decision tree classifiers to construct the classifier ensemble, and then uses this classifier ensemble to detect the traffic incidents. Consequently, it needs to train many times. Compared with decision tree, the training time cost of decision tree is much lower, which is because of decision tree only need train one time.

The main goal of this study was to produce an accurate and detailed map for this invasive species using ASTER multispectral imagery. Area of study : The central-eastern zone of Portugal was used as study area. This whole area is represented in an ASTER scene covering about 321.1 x 10 3 ha. Material and methods : ASTER imagery of two dates (flowering season and dry season) were classified by applying three supervised classifiers (Maximum Likelihood, Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Networks) to five different land cover classifications (from most generic to most detailed land cover categories). The spectral separability of the land cover categories was analyzed and the accuracy of the 30 produced maps compared. Main results : The highest classification accuracy for acacia mapping was obtained using the flowering season imagery, the Maximum Likelihood classifier and the most detailed land cover classification (overall accuracy of 86%; Kappa statistics of 85%; acacia class Kappa statistics of 100%). As a result, the area occupied by acacia was estimated to be approximated 24,770 ha ( i.e. 8% of the study area).

However, high dimensionalities of genotype data and exponential complexity of the search space with respect to the order of targeted interactions make most of existing interaction detection strategies practically inapplicable. Because they are capable of capturing interactions among input variables in addition to the nonlinear effects, decision trees and their ensembles have been recently shown to be resourceful strategies in detecting interactions in GWAS data. However, unlike other nodes, selection of root nodes for decision trees is merely based on marginal effects of candidate variables over the training data, which can greatly limit their epistasis detection performance, especially when disease genotypes have low marginal effects. In this study, we show that modifying the selection criterion of the root node of each new tree joining the ensemble, in a way that captures the interaction with the best variable ranked by the ensemble at the time, leads to a higher power in epistasis detection by decision tree ensembles. We demonstrate the efficacy of this idea using the three most popular decision tree ensemble algorithms: Bagging, Random Forest and Adaboost.

Firstly, light field image is captured by using a light field camera. Secondly, we use frequency domain digital refocus algorithm to manipulate light field image and obtain several serialized refocused images with different focus. Thirdly, wavelet features are extracted from each refocused image, and then an image focusing quality assessment is conducted by using RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernel based SVM model. Finally, we use Mean Shift algorithm to realize color clustering of the original light field image, and then build MRF (Markov Random Field) Model with color nodes. By iterating the likelihood depth result obtained from real scenario depth calibrations according to image focusing quality assessment, finally the depth map of the scene is reconstructed.

This work proposes a novel music classification model based on metric learning whose main objective is to learn a personalized metric for each customer. The metric learning process considers the learning of a set of parameterized distances employing a structured prediction approach from a set of MP3 audio files containing several music genres according to the users taste. The structured prediction solution aims to maximize the separation margin between genre centroids and to minimize the overall intra-cluster distances. To extract the acoustic information we use the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coecient (MFCC) and made a dimensionality reduction using Principal Components Analysis (PCA). We attest the model validity performing a set of experiments and comparing the training and testing results with baseline algorithms, such as K-means and Soft Margin Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM). Also, to prove the prediction capacity, we compare our results with two recent works with good prediction results on the GTZAN dataset.

The extent of demand for accurate SER is reflected in the significant number of papers that have been published and studies performed. An innovative approach to speech recognition is presented in this paper centered on a cloud model alongside the conventional system for measuring emotion in speech. There are multiple stages involved in detecting and identifying emotions in speech from audio clips. The initial pre-processing stage detects the speech in the audio file and applies noise reduction. Next, the system uses Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) algorithms to extract features.This process results in the creation of testing and training datasets populated with the emotions: Neutral, Happiness, Sadness, Fear, Surprise, Disgust and Anger. The classification stage utilizes Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers to identify the emotion.

Many pretext tasks lead to representations that are covariant with image transformations. We argue that, instead, semantic representations ought to be invariant under such transformations. Specifically, we develop Pretext-Invariant Representation Learning (PIRL, pronounced as \"pearl\") that learns invariant representations based on pretext tasks. We use PIRL with a commonly used pretext task that involves solving jigsaw puzzles. We find that PIRL substantially improves the semantic quality of the learned image representations.

In this paper, we propose a Distribution-induced Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Network (named DBGAN) for graph representation learning. Instead of the widely used normal distribution assumption, the prior distribution of latent representation in our DBGAN is estimated in a structure-aware way, which implicitly bridges the graph and feature spaces by prototype learning. Thus discriminative and robust representations are generated for all nodes. Furthermore, to improve their generalization ability while preserving representation ability, the sample-level and distribution-level consistency is well balanced via a bidirectional adversarial learning framework.

Feature robustness was tested before randomly splitting the population in training and test sets (80/20% proportion). A multistep feature selection was applied to the first, excluding noninformative, low variance features and redundant, highly-intercorrelated ones. A Random Forest wrapper was used to identify the most informative among the remaining. An ensemble of J48 decision trees was tuned and finalized in the training set using 10-fold cross-validation, and then assessed on the test set.

There is always a tradeoff among these two properties of classifiers. The similarity measure in the input space as defined by one of the most powerful classifiers, the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, is used in this paper as basis for the construction of Generalized Radial Basis Function (GRBF) classifiers. Hereby, interpretability and a low generalization error can be achieved. The main idea is to approximate the RF kernel by Gaussian functions in a GRBF network. This way the GRBF network can be constructed to approximate the conditional probability of each class given a query input. Since each center in the GRBF is used for the representation of the distribution of a single target class in a localized area of the classifiers input space, interpretability can be achieved by taking account for the membership of a query input to the different localized areas. Whereas in most algorithms the pruning technique is used only to improve the generalization property, here a method is proposed how pruning can be applied to additionally improve the interpretability. Another benefit that comes along with the resulting GRBF classifier is the possibility to detect outliers and to reject decisions that have a low confidence.

Treatments targeting early stages of AD such as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) may be most effective to deaccelerate AD, thus attracting increasing attention. However, MCI has substantial heterogeneity in that it can be caused by various underlying conditions, not only AD. To detect MCI due to AD, NIA-AA published updated consensus criteria in 2011, in which the use of multi-modality images was highlighted as one of the most promising methods. It is of great interest to develop a CAD system based on automatic, quantitative analysis of multi-modality images and machine learning algorithms to help physicians more adequately diagnose MCI due to AD. The challenge, however, is that multi-modality images are not universally available for many patients due to cost, access, safety, and lack of consent. We developed a novel Missing Modality Transfer Learning (MMTL) algorithm capable of utilizing whatever imaging modalities are available for an MCI patient to diagnose the patient\u2019s likelihood of MCI due to AD. Furthermore, we integrated MMTL with radiomics steps including image processing, feature extraction, and feature screening, and a post-processing for uncertainty quantification (UQ), and developed a CAD system called \u201cADMultiImg\u201d to assist clinical diagnosis of MCI due to AD using multi-modality images together with patient demographic and genetic information.

We propose Projection-SVM, a distributed implementation of kernel support vector machine for large datasets using subspace partitioning. In subspace partitioning, a decision tree is constructed on projection of data along the direction of maximum variance (i.e., dominant eigenvector) to obtain smaller partitions (i.e., subspaces) of the dataset. On each of these partitions, a kernel SVM is trained independently over a cluster thereby reducing the overall training time. Also, it results in reducing the prediction time significantly. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach on eight standard large datasets from various application domains, namely, mnist8m, kddcup99, webspam, etc. where Projection-SVM is on an average 150 times faster than sequential SVM while maintaining the classification accuracy.

It consists of constructing cross-domain core medical lexica, an unsupervised, iterative algorithm to accrue more accurate terms into the lexica, rules to address Chinese writing conventions and temporal descriptors, and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm that innovatively utilizes Normalized Google Distance (NGD) to estimate the correlation between medical events and their descriptions. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The effectiveness of the framework was demonstrated with a dataset of 24,817 de-identified Chinese EMRs. The cross-domain medical lexica were capable of recognizing terms with an F1-score of 0.896. 98.5% of recorded medical events were linked to temporal descriptors. The NGD SVM description-event matching achieved an F1-score of 0.874.

In event-description association, the NGD SVM is superior to SVM using only local context and semantic features (F1-score: 0.874 vs. 0.838). ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: The framework is data-driven, weakly supervised, and robust against the variations and noises that tend to occur in a large corpus.

Nonmonotonic reasoning plays an important role in the development of artificial intelligent systems that try to mimic common sense reasoning, as exhibited by humans. On the other hand, a hybrid learning system provides an explanation capability to trained Neural Networks through acquiring symbolic knowledge of a domain, refining it using a set of classified examples along with Connectionist learning techniques and, finally, extracting comprehensible symbolic information. Artificial Nonmonotonic Neural Networks acquire knowledge represented by a multiple inheritance scheme with exceptions, such as nonmonotonic inheritance networks, and then can extract the refined knowledge in the same scheme. The key idea is to use a special cell operation during training in order to preserve the symbolic meaning of the initial inheritance scheme. Methods for knowledge initialization, knowledge refinement and knowledge extraction are introduced. We, also, prove that these methods address perfectly the constraints imposed by nonmonotonicity. Finally, performance of ANNNs is compared to other well-known hybrid systems, through extensive empirical tests. . 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Nonetheless, connectionism has been widely viewed as having implications for symbol grounding, notions of structured representation and compositionality, as well as the issue of nativism. In this paper, we consider each of these issues in detail and find that the current state of connectionism does not warrant the magnitude of many of the philosophical conclusions drawn from it.

Then, I describe our second method based on Ridgelet transform.Our second contribution consists in a new hybrid page segmentation approach. I first describe our stroke-based descriptor that allows detecting text and line candidates using the skeleton of the binarized document image. Then, an active contour model is applied to segment the rest of the image into photo and background regions. Finally, text candidates are clustered using mean-shift analysis technique according to their corresponding sizes. The method is applied for segmenting scanned document images (newspapers and magazines) that contain text, lines and photo regions. Finally, I describe our stroke-based text extraction method. Our approach begins by extracting connected components and selecting text character candidates over the CIE LCH color space using the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) correlation coefficients in order to detect low contrasted regions. The text region candidates are clustered using two different approaches ; a depth first search approach over a graph, and a stable text line criterion.

EEG rhythms were recorded from 37 AD patients, 37 MCI subjects and 37 HC subjects.

Relevance and redundancy analyses were also conducted through the fast correlation-based filter (FCBF) to derive an optimal set of them. The selected features were used to train three different models aimed at classifying the trials: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) and multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP).

This study presents an application of Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA), Cox Proportional Hazard (CPHM) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models to estimate failure degradation and remaining useful life based on sensory data acquired from an operational industrial reciprocating compressor. CVA was used to extract a one-dimensional health indicator from the multivariate data sets, thereby reducing the dimensionality of the original data matrix. The failure rate was obtained by using the CPHM based on historical failure times.

The Random Forest technique is a flexible multivariate method which combines Bagging and Random Split Selection to construct a large collection of decision trees and then combines them to construct a common classifier. Markarian 421 in a high state was observed by TACTIC during December 07, 2005\u2013April 30, 2006 for 202 h. Previous analysis of this data led to a detection of flaring activity from the source at Energy > 1 TeV . Within this data set, a spell of 97 h revealed strong detection of a \u03b3-ray signal with daily flux of > 1 Crab unit on several days. Here we re-analyze this spell as well as the data from the entire observation period with the Random Forest method.

In this paper, we provide a contemporary survey of AL, focused particularly on defenses against attacks on statistical classifiers. After introducing relevant terminology and the goals and range of possible knowledge of both attackers and defenders, we survey recent work on test-time evasion (TTE), data poisoning (DP), and reverse engineering (RE) attacks and particularly defenses against same. In so doing, we distinguish robust classification from anomaly detection (AD), unsupervised from supervised, and statistical hypothesis-based defenses from ones that do not have an explicit null (no attack) hypothesis; we identify the hyperparameters a particular method requires, its computational complexity, as well as the performance measures on which it was evaluated and the obtained quality. We then dig deeper, providing novel insights that challenge conventional AL wisdom and that target unresolved issues, including: 1) robust classification versus AD as a defense strategy; 2) the belief that attack success increases with attack strength, which ignores susceptibility to AD; 3) small perturbations for test-time evasion attacks: a fallacy or a requirement?; 4) validity of the universal assumption that a TTE attacker knows the ground-truth class for the example to be attacked; 5) black, grey, or white box attacks as the standard for defense evaluation; 6) susceptibility of query-based RE to an AD defense. We also discuss attacks on the privacy of training data. We then present benchmark comparisons of several defenses against TTE, RE, and backdoor DP attacks on images.

Features are extracted from EEG signal in two phases; in the first phase, the signal is decomposed into different oscillatory functions with the help of different EMD algorithm and in the second phase, eight different parameters (features) are calculated for the each function for compact representation. In this paper a new feature known as Hurst Exponent along with other feature have been investigated for mental task classification.

All models were developed using the same initial set of 148 topological indices: molecular connectivity chi indices and electrotopological state indices (atom-type, bond-type and group-type E-state), as well as binary indicators. While previous studies have found logP to be a determining factor in genotoxicity, it was not found to be important by any modeling method employed in this study. The three models yielded an average training/test concordance value of 88%, with a low percentage of false positives and false negatives. External validation testing on 400 compounds not used for QSAR model development gave an average concordance of 82%. This value increased to 92% upon removal of less reliable outcomes, as determined by a reliability criterion used within each model. The ANN model showed the best performance in predicting drug compounds, yielding 97% concordance (34/35 drugs) after the removal of less reliable predictions.

The current paper was performed to classify the outcome of stroke by using Least-Squares Support Vector Machines (LSSVMs) models. ::: Materials and Methods: The medical dataset related to stroke disease was achieved from the clinical database of the emergency medicine department. 28 predictors were recorded in raw dataset. For dimension reduction, correlations between input and target (stroke) variables were evaluated. Different LS-SVMs models were performed with radial basis function (RBF), linear and polynomial kernels. 5- fold cross-validation was used in composing stages to achieve the best model using all of the data. The accuracy and the Area under Receiver Operating Curve (AUC ROC) values were used for performance assessment. ::: Results: At first, feature selection stage was performed. 14 input variables were determined after this stage. Whole dataset was partitioned into 5 sub-datasets (D1, D2, D3, D4, D5) to use all data both training and testing. LS-SVMs models performance were evaluated by using 5-fold cross validation method. Accuracy and AUC values of the models were used as performance criteria. The best model performance was evaluated with LS-SVMs model using linear kernel. That model average accuracy was 86.6%. The best accuracy was evaluated with LS-SVM model using linear kernel on dataset D5 was 94%. As a consequence, the LS-SVMs model can be used for predicting the outcome of stroke. ::: Conclusion: The results point out that LS-SVMs with linear kernel have much more accuracy and AUC values for predicting stroke disease. The suggested LS-SVMs with linear kernel may produce beneficial prediction results related to stroke disease.

While numerous metric learning methods have been proposed for person re-identification in recent years, most of them suffer from the small sample size (SSS) problem because there are not enough training samples in most practical person re-identification systems, so that the within-class and between-class variations can be well estimated to learn the distance metric. To address this, we propose a RBML method to model and regulate the eigen-spectrums of these two covariance matrices in a parametric manner, so that discriminative information can be better exploited. Experimental results on three widely used datasets demonstrate the advantage of our proposed RBML over the state-of-the-art person re-identification methods.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-16199-0_15", "venue": "ECCV Workshops", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2270746126", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7973738", "4854422", "10070153", "130535382", "461853", "369876", "3961724", "11864530", "19268640", "207327886", "14852651", "11910515", "11563357", "28395024", "10351844", "15637053", "27322508", "139168351", "4689654", "47325215", "2261947", "10315527", "3069207", "14146409", "4269137", "541943", "425268", "12799509", "6213726", "13619630", "2336447", "486260", "15225312", "16824129", "6485959", "2198160"], "inbound_citations": ["3886458", "4872833", "1636541", "52967007", "22078815", "209331188", "209331188", "30056608"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17541301"}

Long short-term memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), equipped with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) has been proved to be one of the most suitable tools for such tasks. With the aid of CTC, the existence of per-frame labeled sequences are no longer necessary and it suffices to only knowing the sequence of labels. However, in CTC, only a single state is assigned to each label and consequently, LSTM would not learn the intra-label relationships. In this paper, we propose to remedy this weakness by increasing the number of states assigned to each label and actively modeling such intra-label transitions. On the other hand, the output of a CTC network usually corresponds to the set of all possible labels along with a blank. One of the uses of blank is in the recognition of multiple consecutive identical labels. Assigning more than one state to each label, we can also decode consecutive identical labels without resorting to the blank. We investigated the effect of increasing the number of sub-labels with/without blank on the recognition rate of the system. We performed experiments on two printed and handwritten Arabic datasets.

Our method builds on the recent findings that deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) implicitly learn a latent model of object parts even when trained for classification. We also leverage a key correspondence problem insight that the geometric structure between object parts is consistent across multiple object instances. These two concepts are then combined in the form of a novel optimization scheme. This optimization learns a feature embedding by rewarding for projecting features closer on the manifold if they have low feature-space distance. Simultaneously, the optimization penalizes feature clusters whose geometric structure is inconsistent with the observed geometric structure of object parts. In this manner, by accounting for feature space similarities and feature neighborhood context together, a manifold is learned where features belonging to semantically similar object parts cluster together. We also describe transferring these embedded features to the sister tasks of semantic keypoint classification and localization task via a Siamese DCNN.

Furthermore, we propose a joint learning model for simultaneous optimization of the sparse coding and the optimal subspace representation. In addition, we generalize the proposed LSDT model into a kernel-based linear/nonlinear basis transformation learning framework for tackling nonlinear subspace shifts in reproduced kernel Hilbert space. The proposed methods have three advantages: 1) the latent space and the reconstruction are jointly learned for pursuit of an optimal subspace transfer; 2) with the theory of sparse subspace clustering, a few valuable source and target data points are formulated to reconstruct the target data with noise (outliers) from source domain removed during domain adaptation, such that the robustness is guaranteed; and 3) a nonlinear projection of some latent space with kernel is easily generalized for dealing with highly nonlinear domain shift (e.g., face poses).

We choose two feature sets that are exemplary of very different methods: The first set consists of Tempo-Frequency Parameters (TFPs) that are hand-picked to describe the spectral whistle contours. The second feature set embodies spectral information measured with the Fourier Descriptors (FD) commonly used in image processing for contour representation. The computed feature vectors are fed into the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithms. The KNN in its basic form is a simple classifier that works well if feature clusters have clear margins and SVM uses a data dependent margin chosen for optimal performance.

High-resolution images have the characteristics of abundant geometric and detail information, which are beneficial to detailed classification. In order to make full use of these characteristics, a classification algorithm based on conditional random fields (CRFs) is presented in this paper. The proposed algorithm integrates spectral, spatial contextual, and spatial location cues by modeling the probabilistic potentials. The spectral cues modeled by the unary potentials can provide basic information for discriminating the various land-cover classes. The pairwise potentials consider the spatial contextual information by establishing the neighboring interactions between pixels to favor spatial smoothing. The spatial location cues are explicitly encoded in the higher order potentials. The higher order potentials consider the nonlocal range of the spatial location interactions between the target pixel and its nearest training samples. This can provide useful information for the classes that are easily confused with other land-cover types in the spectral appearance. The proposed algorithm integrates spectral, spatial contextual, and spatial location cues within a CRF framework to provide complementary information from varying perspectives, so that it can address the common problem of spectral variability in remote sensing images, which is directly reflected in the accuracy of each class and the average accuracy.

Therefore, estimating synthetic CT (sCT) images from corresponding MR images and obviating CT scanning is of great interest, but can be particularly challenging in the abdomen owing to a range of tissue types and physiologic motion. For this purpose, inspired by deep learning, we design a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) model that organically combines ResNet, U-net, and auxiliary classifier-augmented GAN (RU-ACGAN for short). The significance of our effort is three-fold: 1) The combination of ResNet and U-net, instead of only the U-net which was commonly used in existing conditional GAN, is enlisted to constitute the generative network in RU-ACGAN. This has the potential to generate more accurate CT than existing methods. 2) Adding the classifier to the discriminant network makes the training process of the proposed model more stable, and thereby benefits the robustness of sCT estimation. 3) Owing to the delicate architecture, RU-ACGAN is capable of estimating superior sCT using only a limited quantity of training data.

A typical idea to deal with the first point is to say that an algorithm performs well if it infers in the limit the correct language. The second point has led to debate about how to define polynomial time: the main definitions of polynomial inference have been proposed by Pitt and Angluin. We return in this paper to a definition proposed by Gold that requires a characteristic set of strings to exist for each grammar, and this set to be polynomial in the size of the grammar or automaton that is to be learned, where the size of the sample is the sum of the lengths of all strings it includes. The learning algorithm must also infer correctly as soon as the characteristic set is included in the data. We first show that this definition corresponds to a notion of teachability as defined by Goldman and Mathias.

The process is essential as it represents the first phase for a complete multilingual-enabled speech processing applications. However, most efforts are focused on European languages and the research is relatively few for other languages such as Arabic. This is mainly due to the lack of tools and resources, e.g., Arabic speech corpora. Furthermore, the majority of the proposed approaches for Arabic detection are language-dependent rather than independent ones, in which the model uses only acoustic properties of speech signal. This paper describes an ongoing research to develop a language independent Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) detector, which is a binary Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier that is based on speech acoustic features. In that context, the classifier is used to classify speech utterance into either classA, which represents the Arabic language or classNA to denote non-Arabic languages. As most currently available speech corpora are license restricted and their languages are selected based on population or geographical distribution, a new multilingual speech corpus with six languages is being created.

Exploring new applications for image processing techniques within the area of construction engineering and management is a steady growing field of research. One of the initial steps for various image processing applications is automatically detecting various types of construction materials on construction images. In this paper, the authors conducted a comparison study to evaluate the performance of different machine learning techniques for detection of three common categorists of building materials: Concrete, red brick, and OSB boards. The employed classifiers in this research are: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function (RBF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). To achieve this goal, the feature vectors extracted from image blocks are classified to perform a comparison between the efficiency of these methods for building material detection. The results indicate that for all three types of materials, SVM outperformed the other two techniques in terms of accurately detecting the material textures in images. The results also reveals that the common material detection algorithms perform very well in cases of detecting materials with distinct color and appearance (e.g., red brick); while their performance for detecting materials with color and texture variance (e.g., concrete) as well as materials containing similar color and appearance properties with other elements of the scene (e.g., ORB boards) might be less accurate.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s12205-015-0726-0", "venue": null, "journal": "KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1158935686", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["53702389", "201905135", "215302429", "116274680", "52149832", "116599157", "104390981", "203996060", "155103801", "103327858", "106201492"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:32309519"}

FACS is the best known and the most commonly used system to describe facial activity in terms of facial muscle actions (i.e., action units, AUs). We will present our research on the analysis of the morphological, spatio-temporal and behavioural aspects of facial expressions. In contrast with most other researchers in the field who use appearance based techniques, we use a geometric feature based approach. We will argue that that approach is more suitable for analysing facial expression temporal dynamics. Our system is capable of explicitly exploring the temporal aspects of facial expressions from an input colour video in terms of their onset (start), apex (peak) and offset (end). The fully automatic system presented here detects 20 facial points in the first frame and tracks them throughout the video. From the tracked points we compute geometry-based features which serve as the input to the remainder of our systems. The AU activation detection system uses GentleBoost feature selection and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to find which AUs were present in an expression. Temporal dynamics of active AUs are recognised by a hybrid GentleBoost-SVM-Hidden Markov model classifier. The system is capable of analysing 23 out of 27 existing AUs with high accuracy. The main contributions of the work presented in this thesis are the following: we have created a method for fully automatic AU analysis with state-of-the-art recognition results.

We propose to address the problem of dynamic text classification by replacing the traditional, fixed-size output layer with a learned, semantically meaningful metric space. Here the distances between textual inputs are optimized to perform nearest-neighbor classification across overlapping label sets. Changing the label set does not involve removing parameters, but rather simply adding or removing support points in the metric space. Then the learned metric can be fine-tuned with only a few additional training examples. We demonstrate that this simple strategy is robust to changes in the label space.

The classification nodes aim at decreasing the variance of the pixel labels of the patches by using our proposed structured criterion while the regression nodes aim at decreasing the variance of the displacements between the patches and the facial landmarks. The proposed framework allows us to predict the face mask and facial landmarks locations jointly. We test the model on face images from several datasets with significant occlusion.

As brain activities are many and highly dynamic in nature, processing of EEG signals is a challenging task. Since classification is more accurate when the pattern is simplified through representation by well performing features, feature extraction and selection play an important role in classification systems such as Clonal Selection Classification Algorithm (CSCA) algorithm. Methods/Analysis: This study is one such attempt to perform the prosthetic limb movements using EEG signals. In this research, the performance of CSCA for prosthetic limb movements of EEG signals has been reported. Findings: In this paper, the EEG signals are acquired for four different limb movements like finger open (fopen), finger close (fclose), wrist clockwise (wcw) and wrist counterclock wise (wccw). These EEG signals can be used to build a model to control the prosthetic limb movements using CSCA algorithm. The statistical parameters were extracted from the EEG signals. The best feature set was identified using J48 decision tree classifier. The well performing features were then classified using CSCA algorithm. The classification performance of CSCA has been reported. Novelty/Improvement: Our work is useful for controlling artificial limb with movements using EEG signals.

We apply five different automatic annotation techniques to produce labeled data using ROUGE similarity measure, Basic Element (BE) overlap, syntactic similarity measure, semantic similarity measure, and Extended String Subsequence Kernel (ESSK).

Manual annotation of a whole 3D ultrasound volume consisting of 100 and more slices, i.e. 2D ultrasound images, is a tedious task even when using handy, computer-assisted segmentation tools.

On the contrary, the nearest neighbor classifier has great theoretical potential because of its ability to model complex decision boundaries with low bias. Furthermore, it theoretically guarantees an error of no more than twice the Bayes error rate on an infinite data set.

The influence of each weak learner in the fitted additive model is inversely proportional to their OOB error. Moreover, the probability of selecting an out-of-bag training example is increased if misclassified by the simpler weak learners, in order to enable the boosted model to focus on complex regions of the input space. We also adopt a selective weight updating procedure, whereas only the out-of-bag examples are updated as the boosting iterations go by. This serves the purpose of slowing down the tendency to focus on just a few hard-to-classify examples. By mitigating this undesired bias known to affect boosting algorithms under high dimensional and noisy scenarios - due to both the selective weighting schema and a proper weak-learner effectiveness assessment - we greatly improve classification effectiveness. Our experiments with several datasets in three representative high-dimensional and noisy domains - topic, sentiment and microarray data classification - an up to ten state-of-the-art classifiers (covering almost 500 results), show that BROOF is the only classifier to be among the top performers in all tested datasets from the topic classification domain, and in the vast majority of cases in sentiment and microarray domains, a surprising result given the knowledge that there is no single top-notch classifier for all datasets.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/2766462.2767747", "venue": null, "journal": "Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2004230892", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["7756671", "89141", "15619865", "961425", "3116168", "10344554", "6644398", "14723701", "7955044", "14972567", "1556809", "167569", "15019092", "11027141", "13300503", "6017580", "14755271", "6847493", "17835539", "60611377", "2136976", "61014716", "61962167", "2813425", "10610460", "3946414", "39598220", "14400133"], "inbound_citations": ["207757727", "70337501", "49192179", "18813971"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:331774"}

The ground truth is derived from ratings given to clean speech extracted from an extensive subjective test. Our results show that, under the considered conditions, the AMR-WB+ codec permits good levels of classification accuracy, comparable to the classification with clean, non-degraded speech.

However, existing methods generally characterize the sample similarities first by constructing multiple fixed graphs with manually determined parameters, and then perform the feature selection on a composite one. They will suffer from two severe problems: (1) The fixed graphs may be unreliable as the raw multi-view features usually contain adverse noises and cannot accurately capture the intrinsic sample relations. (2) The graph construction and feature selection are separate and independent, the two-step learning may lead to sub-optimal performance. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we propose an effective unsupervised multi-view feature selection method, dubbed as Nonnegative Structured Graph Learning (NSGL). Specifically, we develop a unified learning framework, which directly learns the structured graph from the raw features by imposing a rank constraint, and simultaneously performs adaptive feature selection with exploiting the complementarity of multi-view features. Besides, we introduce the pseudo label learning to extract the discriminative semantic information in unsupervised scenarios and steer the graph learning process. The informative features are finally selected by forcing the feature selection matrix to be sparse in rows with sparse regression. To solve the challenging optimization problem, we first transform the formulated problem into an equivalent one that can be tackled more easily, and then develop an efficient alternate optimization algorithm guaranteed with convergence to calculate the solution iteratively. Extensive experiments on several widely tested benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of NSGL compared with several state-of-the-art approaches.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.neucom.2020.01.044", "venue": null, "journal": "Neurocomputing", "mag_id": "3000308450", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214286343"}

Separating a rumour from an informative post is of great importance nowadays because posts which contain rumours, try to provide an information which sounds similar to the actual happening. Rumour detection in social media can be treated as a text classification problem. However, the problem involves several challenges. Both rumours and non-rumours may contain a similar form of textual items like words, sentences etc. about an actual happening. The context and way of representing those textual items make a rumour different from a non-rumour post. In our work, we show that in many such cases, standard ways of feature construction does not always capture these patterns. Therefore, we propose a novel approach of feature construction by reweighting the TF-IDF score of some particular terms taking into account the label information of training data. This leads to a better construction of features than the standard TF-IDF representation leading to a more separable set of features. A classffier with TF-IDF boosted features performs better than the combination of standard TF-IDF and state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms using standard TF-IDF score like LightGBM, Gradient Boosting, SVM etc. This is experimentally validated on three different social events which created rumours.

In this paper we investigated the properties of ensemble learning with a series of experiment and showed that it has the properties mentioned actually. We also proposed a prior-updating method using data. Prior distributions are usually set as fixed, non-informative ones. With the updating strategy, we got better classification result compared to the fixed prior strategy because it makes partly use of the statistics of training data as a reference distribution. However it showed a little large variance in performance mainly due to the decrease of smoothing effect which is one of the merits of ensemble learning.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2266478079", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62424506"}

The neural mechanisms of these effects are not fully understood. The proposed model includes many local analyzers, each consisting of two sets of neurons. The first set has two independent cardinal detectors (CDs), whose responses depend on stimulus orientation. The second set has many orientation detectors (OD) tuned to different orientations of the stimulus. The ODs sum up the responses of the two CDs with respective weightings and output a preferred orientation depending on the ratio of CD responses. It is suggested that during prolonged viewing, the responses of the CDs decrease: the greater the excitation of the detector, the more rapid the decrease in its response. Thereby, the ratio of CD responses changes during the adaptation, causing the normalization effect and the TAE. The CDs of the different local analyzers laterally inhibit each other and cause the TI.

In this paper, we propose a novel two-view KG embedding model, JOIE, with the goal to produce better knowledge embedding and enable new applications that rely on multi-view knowledge. JOIE employs both cross-view and intra-view modeling that learn on multiple facets of the knowledge base. The cross-view association model is learned to bridge the embeddings of ontological concepts and their corresponding instance-view entities. The intra-view models are trained to capture the structured knowledge of instance and ontology views in separate embedding spaces, with a hierarchy-aware encoding technique enabled for ontologies with hierarchies. We explore multiple representation techniques for the two model components and investigate with nine variants of JOIE. Our model is trained on large-scale knowledge bases that consist of massive instances and their corresponding ontological concepts connected via a (small) set of cross-view links.

To solve the boundary handling problem of the cuckoo search (CS) algorithm in the cuckoo birds\u2019 searching processes, this investigation proposes a simple method, called the out-bound-back mechanism, to help those out-bounded cuckoo birds return to their previous (the most recent iteration) optimal location.

Therefore, the self-recurrent mechanism is hybridized with the SVR-based model. Ultimately, this investigation presents the VMD-SR-SVRCBCS model, by hybridizing the VMD method, the SVR model with the self-recurrent mechanism, the Tent chaotic mapping function, the out-bound-back mechanism, and the cuckoo search algorithm.

Then multiple related classification tasks are learned simultaneously for each feature to increase the sample size for each task and improve the prediction performance. Finally the outputs of each feature are integrated by a Support Vector Machine that learns how to optimally combine and weight each feature.

Moreover, although ensembles of learning machines have been used to learn in the presence of concept drift, there has been no deep study of why they can be helpful for that and which of their features can contribute or not for that. As diversity is one of these features, we present a diversity analysis in the presence of different types of drifts. We show that, before the drift, ensembles with less diversity obtain lower test errors. On the other hand, it is a good strategy to maintain highly diverse ensembles to obtain lower test errors shortly after the drift independent on the type of drift, even though high diversity is more important for more severe drifts. Longer after the drift, high diversity becomes less important. Diversity by itself can help to reduce the initial increase in error caused by a drift, but does not provide the faster recovery from drifts in long-term.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/TKDE.2009.156", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2139327121,52317678", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16796908", "6442322", "15662659", "492233", "14505386", "5874117", "6401357", "1937006", "16296509", "7062460", "11868540", "1761772", "15672006", "2606652", "23207009", "14379357", "1193409", "39417", "5364873", "12765938", "14005036", "1137692", "14317314", "15673980", "15015405", "4474193", "10021850", "15558554", "13158776", "59712", "18215332", "8142232", "12394453", "89141", "61567032", "1097238", "207738357", "33776987", "209099422", "2743403", "119821954", "15216193", "17786707", "64259583"], "inbound_citations": ["2341372", "52988978", "1136571", "108513", "18986073", "201668818", "52269905", "17267096", "22930616", "210975224", "3404108", "3230190", "20731307", "209901187", "25417297", "4856870", "3613393", "4632089", "4694859", "204055058", "6177593", "9345711", "213049713", "10110725", "9336301", "800271", "30418437", "201695203", "1371464", "14370906", "209450347", "209450347", "34259595", "27664456", "14736213", "14010201", "12718965", "30321610", "18774932", "4767308", "6954041", "17799705", "8042177", "18659342", "53041379", "34495509", "53322918", "15192294", "211143397", "19111596", "15308287", "5859498", "211043729", "14506351", "5324901", "15966500", "928857", "14137407", "57189189", "214619683", "17130086", "30131630", "15546018", "22760674", "49583566", "3521844", "125342825", "15081419", "202727184", "203581376", "902407", "15582279", "14793962", "59231483", "204868084", "155158216", "14118651", "5705465", "943963", "32219273", "9998470", "132446565", "54833484", "24722113", "195738380", "203640800", "52930255", "2333620", "16879732", "4443278", "9529225", "11626467", "16284068", "11437022", "21647447", "11918274", "17775970", "17775970", "15366745", "13952044", "207208264", "58934600", "5945464", "214621780", "17213267", "8557084", "15177723", "201125148", "35722094", "206452028", "19520130", "2534156", "210931035", "607907", "7488968", "52987410", "15989644", "201905510", "18914261", "189927488", "16725626", "215220286", "160014048", "16383476", "16732688", "3918777", "211242333", "14196157", "205703203", "1161030", "3431696", "211298716", "14876882", "52212580", "6109148", "31878062", "16526253", "11152627", "51634201", "210181866", "15362150", "18605525", "208038604", "210992425", "209322653", "14495613", "3344169", "26990770", "16645380", "1369821", "20717113", "201833181", "201087802", "16688393", "199477393", "158620245", "16834654", "10779176", "2772032", "14425280", "11062359", "6786471", "1166003"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16592739"}

For the remaining category which is difficult to differentiate by the rate-distortion cost of the PU mode $merge\\,\\,2N\\times 2N$ , an early CU pruning scheme based on conditional random fields is performed in Stage II, which takes both the local characteristics of the current CU and the coding information of its neighboring CUs into consideration.

However, quad-pol sensors have some limitations due to their complexity, increased data rate, and reduced coverage and revisit time. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the added value of quad-pol data in a multi-temporal crop classification framework based on SAR imagery. With this aim, three RADARSAT-2 scenes were acquired between May and June 2010. Once we analyzed the separability and the descriptive analysis of the features, an object-based supervised classification was performed using the Random Forests classification algorithm. Classification results obtained with dual-pol (VV-VH) data as input were compared to those using quad-pol data in different polarization bases (linear H-V, circular, and linear 45\u00b0), and also to configurations where several polarimetric features (Pauli and Cloude\u2013Pottier decomposition features and co-pol coherence and phase difference) were added. Dual-pol data obtained satisfactory results, equal to those obtained with quad-pol data (in H-V basis) in terms of overall accuracy (0.79) and Kappa values (0.69). Quad-pol data in circular and linear 45\u00b0 bases resulted in lower accuracies. The inclusion of polarimetric features, particularly co-pol coherence and phase difference, resulted in enhanced classification accuracies with an overall accuracy of 0.86 and Kappa of 0.79 in the best case, when all the polarimetric features were added. Improvements were also observed in the identification of some particular crops, but major crops like cereals, rapeseed, and sunflower already achieved a satisfactory accuracy with the VV-VH dual-pol configuration and obtained only minor improvements.

SR_LML requires the processed data to contain good spatial relations, but the requirement may not be satisfied. We solve the problem by dividing the image into small tiles and applying the SR_LML in each of them. In a tile, each pixel is spatially related to some other pixels, and thus good spatial relations of data can be guaranteed and the effect of the spatial regularizer can be maximized. Moreover, an alignment method is applied to merge all the resulted manifolds in different tiles to a globally consistent manifold. The SR_LML performed in small tiles in conjunction with alignment is denoted as SR_LML_TA; it is able to best use of the spatial relations of pixels in the image, and is suitable for large-scale remote sensing scenes. Experiments with airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS), reflective optics system imaging spectrometer (ROSIS), and NSF-funded Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM) hyperspectral images demonstrated that the manifold coordinates of SR_LML_TA can provide good separation of classes that are difficult to distinguish.

Specifically, it can perform virtual monochromatic imaging to obtain accurate tissue composition with less beam hardening artifacts. It is an ill-posed problem that monochromatic images are acquired by material decomposition matrix, suffering from amplified noise due to various uncertain factors. Aiming at modeling spatial and spectral correlations, this paper proposes a Wasserstein generative adversarial network with a hybrid loss (WGAN-HL) for monochromatic imaging instead of voxel-by-voxel decomposition. A min-max concept about the optimal transport is introduced in WGAN to make a tradeoff between generated images and target images where the authenticity of data cannot be distinguished anymore by network. The hybrid loss focuses on the data distribution of the generated images and target images from voxel space together with feature space to meet clinical requirements. Thereby, the proposed network can generate robust monochromatic images with accurate decomposition at any energy, while identifying and removing noise and artifacts. The advantages of this method are demonstrated in CT value measurement, beam hardening, and metal artifacts removal. Simulations and real tests prove that the WGAN-HL method preserves the important tissue details with less noise and it can reconstruct more accurate CT value.

First, we propose a novel graph-regularized structured support vector machine (GS-SVM) algorithm by combining manifold learning and structured learning. Then, the proposed GS-SVM algorithm is employed to build the appearance model and a novel tracking method is developed. This new tracker not only absorbs the advantage of structured learning that deals with the intermediate classification step existing in tracking-by-detection methods, but also exploits the geometry structures in the tracked results and neighboring regions. In addition, a hybrid update strategy is introduced to fit with the GS-SVM-based appearance model.

Syntactic search is matching documents or objects containing specific keywords like user-history, location, preference etc. to improve the results.

Semantic search, on the other hand, resolves these issues but suffers from lack of annotation, absence of WordNet in case of low resource languages. In this work, we have demonstrated an end to end procedure to improve the performance of semantic search using semi-supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. An available Bengali repository was chosen to have seven types of semantic properties primarily to develop the system. Performance has been tested using Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Our system has achieved the efficiency to predict the correct semantics using knowledge base over the time of learning. A repository containing around a million sentences, a product of TDIL project of Govt. of India, was used to test our system at first instance. Then the testing has been done for other languages.

The relationship between data pre-processing techniques and the data distributions has never been analysed in previous studies. This article mainly focuses on reviewing and evaluating some popular and recently developed resampling and feature selection methods for class imbalance learning. We analyse the effectiveness of each technique from data distribution perspective. Extensive experiments have been done based on five classifiers, four performance measures, eight learning techniques across twenty real-world datasets. Experimental results show that: (1) resampling and feature selection techniques exhibit better performance using support vector machine (SVM) classifier. However, resampling and Feature Selection techniques perform poorly when using C4.5 decision tree and Linear discriminant analysis classifiers; (2) for datasets with different distributions, techniques such as Random undersampling and Feature Selection perform better than other data pre-processing methods with T Location-Scale distribution when using SVM and KNN (K-nearest neighbours) classifiers.

Looking at the shape and duration of these current pulses enables us to estimate the size as well as the concentration of these molecules. Discrimination between different analytes can be performed by extracting appropriate features from the Coulter signals (events) and using them for classification. The challenge in being able to identify particular analytes is that a drop in current can also be caused by a molecule bouncing off the pore wall rather than moving through the micropore. Such drops are called non-events and can be discriminated from the events using Support Vector Machines. In this paper, we consider the amplitude of the current drop and the duration of the current pulse as features to determine if an event occurred.

Despite major advances in algorithms and software, QSAR models have inherent limitations associated with a size and chemical-structure diversity of the training set, experimental error, and many characteristics of structure representation and correlation algorithms. Whereas excellent fit to the training data may be readily attainable, often models fail to predict accurately chemicals that are outside their domain of applicability. A QSAR\u2019s utility and, in the case of regulatory decisions, justification for usage increasingly depend on the ability to quantify a model\u2019s potential for predicting unknown chemicals with some known degree of certainty. It is never possible to predict an unknown chemical with absolute certainty. Here we report on two QSAR models based on different data sets for classification of chemicals according to their ability to bind to the estrogen receptor. The models were developed by using a novel QSAR method, Decision Forest, which combines the results of multiple heterogeneous but comparable Decision Tree models to produce a consensus prediction. We used an extensive cross-validation process to define an applicability domain for model predictions based on two quantitative measures: prediction confidence and domain extrapolation. Together, these measures quantify the accuracy of each prediction within and outside of the training domain. Despite being based on large and diverse training sets, both QSAR models had poor accuracy for chemicals within the domain of low confidence, whereas good accuracy was obtained for those within the domain of high confidence. For prediction in the high confidence domain, accuracy was inversely proportional to the degree of domain extrapolation.

Many existing face sketch synthesis methods straightly learn the relationship between photo images and sketch images, and it's relatively difficult for these methods to take the discrete specific details for the sketch synthesis process. The synthesized sketches generated by these traditional methods consistently manifest the coarse textures of face images, however the fine details of few critical facial segments are exclusively lost. By addressing these problems, we propose a novel framework for face sketch synthesis by applying deep learning features in this paper. Initially, we use the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model to get the more realistic synthesized sketch through learning the nonlinear mapping relationship between face photo-sketch images and use them as the coarse estimation images for the network. During this synthesis process, the generated output images are highly contaminated with noise. Then, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) based model called ResNet as the secondary processing tool for generated synthesized images. As the result, it fairly reduces the noise and distortion of the synthesized images and we got fine estimation images as the residual images for the network. Given the coarse synthesized images and these residual images, a fully functional network model is designed to get the final synthesized face sketches with the fine and critical details in contrast to traditional techniques. Multiple experiments illustrate that our proposed method has remarkable results on the face sketch synthesis tasks as compared to the traditional methods.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CompComm.2018.8780648", "venue": "2018 IEEE 4th International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC)", "journal": "2018 IEEE 4th International Conference on Computer and Communications (ICCC)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2965623706", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["50770500", "207763512", "6593498", "207763512", "206594692", "23200190", "17485723", "682896", "14224583", "9057652", "11072034", "14596482", "1033682", "206592295", "62983087", "38520234", "17485723", "23200190", "207761262", "10243856"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199440583"}

The pressure increases first with increasing loading or sunspot number, then remains relatively constant after reaching a peak value at ~8000 kV min loading or sunspot number of ~80. The loading effect is stronger when PSW is lower and the pressure variations are stronger near midnight than away from midnight. The sunspot number effect is clearer at smaller r.

In this work, we investigate two approaches for automatic detection of such defects in a single image of a PV cell.

The more hardware-efficient approach is based on hand-crafted features that are classified in a Support Vector Machine (SVM).

In this paper we present a new approach based on bilateral facial asymmetry for gender classification. For that purpose, we propose to first capture the facial asymmetry by using Deformation Scalar Field (DSF) applied on each 3D face, then train such representations (DSFs) with several classifiers, including Random Forest, Adaboost and SVM after PCA-based feature space transformation. Experiments conducted on FRGCv2 dataset showed that a significant relationship exists between gender and facial symmetry when achieving a 90.99% correct classification rate for the 466 earliest scans of subjects (mainly neutral) and 88.12% on the whole FRGCv2 dataset (including facial expressions).", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/fg.2013.6553712", "venue": "2013 10th IEEE International Conference and Workshops on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG)", "journal": "2013 10th IEEE International Conference and Workshops on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG)", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2037817477", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["32992440", "14259482", "5605322", "1560613", "10118600", "14592289", "20257551", "7942983", "12578618", "10269389", "24462096", "10659125", "844981", "2930938", "872650", "10746886"], "inbound_citations": ["18893182", "7003938", "12768819", "14083088"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14682630"}

Once the Bug is reported on Bug Tracking System, their attributes are analyzed and subsequently assigned to various fixers for their resolution. During the last two decades Machine-Learning Techniques (MLT) has been used to create self-improving software. Supervised machine learning technique is widely used for prediction of patterns in various applications but, we have found very few for software repositories. Bug severity, an attribute of a software bug report is the degree of impact that a defect has on the development or operation of a component or system. Bug severity can be classified into different levels based on their impact on the system. In this paper, an attempt has been made to demonstrate the applicability of machine learning algorithms namely Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes Multinomial, Support Vector Machine, J48 and RIPPER in determining the class of bug severity of bug report data of NASA from PROMISE repository. The applicability of algorithm in determining the various levels of bug severity for bug repositories has been validated using various performance measures by applying 5-fold cross validation1.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/CONSEG.2012.6349519", "venue": "2012 CSI Sixth International Conference on Software Engineering (CONSEG)", "journal": "2012 CSI Sixth International Conference on Software Engineering (CONSEG)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2004993094", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["59923857", "214266", "6399332", "9312951", "9933308", "16263166", "52853287", "57146809", "5637463", "6914823", "16196403", "14428047", "9542682", "2427083", "3355639", "220965", "2374635", "11652537", "60375743", "14561315", "6492502", "1204938", "60062595", "60869019", "18767751", "13252401", "5262555"], "inbound_citations": ["18825819", "17710598", "14609370", "121542", "20249385", "43998333", "6189764", "214799093", "67773685", "61808037", "195845068", "203648941", "49870261", "39741425", "17308815", "195182559", "17209097", "16647679", "46223979", "17777459", "13755131", "51842173", "131776833", "202714575", "211268209", "3690940", "23349444", "23349444", "50777894", "62021518", "26635005", "51987218", "14733913", "195775268", "46884080", "51716123"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14686380"}
