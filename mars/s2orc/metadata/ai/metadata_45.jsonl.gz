Abstract Dynamic Field Theory is based on spatially continuous representations of parameter space and provides a math- ematical framework to study the metric structure of rep- resentations. We review evidence for such metric struc- ture and provide a Dynamic Field Theory of stimulus- response association to account for effects caused by the metric structure of representations such as the distance effect and the interaction of the Hick and Hyman effects with stimulus metrics. We show how the integration of different sources of information contributes to stimulus- response association by providing a new model of the manual Stroop effect. \u201cred\u201d \u201cgreen\u201d Introduction People continuously interact with their environment gen- erating simple behaviors such as pointing or reaching, but also using more complex skills such as using a com- puter. Everyday life thus requires a highly flexible neural system that may adjust and readjust its behav- ior depending on situational constraints, may continu- ously learn new responses toward sensory inputs and may adapt already existing stimulus-response mappings. Cognitive scientists and psychologists have studied how neural systems learn to react to input from sensory sur- faces and how they compute the corresponding output through stimulus-response association paradigms. If a participant is asked to respond to a red stimulus by pressing a right button and to a green stimulus by press- ing a left button, this requires a stimulus-response map- ping that the subject probably has never encountered before. Nevertheless, within a very few practice trials participants are able to perform such a task. While such tasks might appear trivial to the partic- ipant, it is not obvious how the nervous system might achieve them. One way researchers have tried to study stimulus-response associations consists of bringing into conflict multiple sources of response specification. In the classic Stroop task (review by MacLeod, 1991), for instance, the meaning of color words is brought into con- flict with the color the words are printed in. Participants have to speak out loud the latter and are slowed in their response if that color is incongruent with the meaning of the color word. Neural accounts for such conflict in connectionist mod- els are typically based on units that code for entire stim- ulus or response categories. For instance, neurons rep- resenting the print-color information \u201dred\u201d or the word red green red print color green word task input Figure 1: Connectionist model of the Stroop paradigm, redrawn after Cohen, Dunbar & McClelland (1990) Neurophysiological evidence on the other hand sug- gests that features are represented in continuous feature maps, in which populations of neurons with broad tun- ing curves are activated. Across neocortex and other parts of the central nervous system, the location of neu- rons in the network determines what information neu- rons encode (space code principle). In many cortical ar- eas, topographic mapping makes that neighboring neu- rons encode similar kinds of information. Independently of topography (anatomical coordinates), neuronal repre- sentations of parameters can be constructed by sorting neurons according to what they code (functional coor- dinates) (Georgopoulos et al., 1982). Neuronal inter- action is sensitive to this metric structure of represen- tations, meaning that neurons representing similar in- formation excite each other while neurons representing dissimilar information inhibit each other. Wilson and Cowan (1973) as well as Amari (1977) have shown that the processing of information in such cortical and subcor- tical networks is mathematically well described by con- tinuous dimensions with an associated metric defined by interaction.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2768371895", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": ["2811608", "18570403", "144545775", "10436266", "2972535", "8763721", "12723464", "15544426", "25760924", "145075494", "11071702", "8877610", "194104", "15309701", "10284218", "15653070", "6908951", "198839145", "292546"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17436477"}

Using this assumption, we train the TCE model to encode videos such that adjacent frames exist close to each other and videos are separated from one another. Using TCE we learn robust representations from large quantities of unlabeled video data. We evaluate our self-supervised trained TCE model by adding a classification layer and finetuning the learned representation on the downstream task of video action recognition on the UCF101 dataset. We obtain 68.7% accuracy and outperform the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods despite using a significantly smaller dataset for pre-training.

In the Appalachian forests of the eastern United States, rhododendron (Rhododendron maximum) is the most prevalent species constituent of the understory evergreen shrub community and can affect forest diversity and structure by altering light and moisture regimes, and changing soil chemical and physical properties. We examine the spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of the evergreen shrub layer within a mid\u2010Appalachian forest over the period from 1986 to 2011 using Landsat TM data to explore how shrub expansion is related to landscape position (e.g., elevation, aspect, and distance\u2010to\u2010stream).

Our experimental results show that automatically tuned DMs for each class outperform a fixed DM approach for all classes, especially with non-frontal poses.

Normally, the decision boundary cannot be described as a clear boundary because of the numerous uncertainties in text documents. This paper attempts to address this issue by proposing an effective model based on sliding window technique (SW) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to deal with the uncertain boundary and to improve the effectiveness of binary text classification. This model aims to set the decision boundary by dividing the training documents into three distinct regions (positive, boundary, and negative regions) to ensure the certainty of extracted knowledge to describe relevant information. The model then organizes training samples for the learning task to build a multiple SVMs based classifier. The experimental results using the standard dataset Reuters Corpus Volume 1 (RCV1) and TREC topics for text classification, show that the proposed model significantly outperforms six state-of-the-art baseline models in binary text classification.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-03991-2_72", "venue": "Australasian Conference on Artificial Intelligence", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2900140651", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54437187"}

Preliminary results indicate high detection accuracy of 88% and an area under the ROC curve of 96%.

The texture features are computed using a combination of the Complex Wavelet Transforms (CWT) and the Contourlet Transform (CT), and classification is done using the Random Forest (RF) classifier. The method has been tested using a dataset composed of 230 samples. The results obtained are very encouraging and promising.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.patrec.2013.08.004", "venue": "Pattern Recognit.

Connectionist parsing, in the broad sense, got under way in 1982 with the localist work of Small, Cottrell and Shastri, Cottrell and Small, and the similar work of Pollack and Waltz [2-4]. These were spreading activation models whose main focus was lexical disambiguation. They typically had a number of layers of nodes, such as a lexical level, a word-sense level and a case logic level. The models were motivated by two factors: firstly the belief that disambiguation requires integrated, parallel processing of knowledge from multiple sources, and secondly the attempt to model semantic priming, which means that the activation of concept structures in the brain reduces the reaction time for subsequent judgements involving associated concepts.", "year": 1992, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-94-011-2360-0_14", "venue": "Neural Networks for Vision, Speech and Natural Language", "journal": "Neural Networks for Vision, Speech and Natural Language", "mag_id": "36169754", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59627121"}

The newborn screening program plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and treatment of infants having CH. However, human error and lack of a proper method for detailed interpretation of the data gathered by the screening programs affect the success rate and consequently, the cognitive outcomes. Data mining techniques can notably assist experts in diagnosing CH or in choosing the best medication. Methods This cross-sectional study investigates the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Chi-Squared Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID), and Iterative Dichotomiser-3 (ID3) for diagnosis of CH. The newborn screening data of 4812 infants, registered in the Health Center of Alborz province, Iran, in 2016, was used to train and test the corresponding classifiers. Since this dataset is imbalanced, we combined the mentioned classifiers with Bootstrap aggregating (Bagging) and boosting techniques, to avoid the negative effects of this problem on the classification results and to achieve more accurate classifiers. Results The SVM-Bagging technique had the best performance, with precision and specificity of 100%, recall of 73.33%, F-measure of 84.62%, and an accuracy of 99.58%. Results show acceptable capabilities of this classifier to analyze newborn screening data. The overall results also demonstrate that besides blood test results, other factors such as gender, type of marriage, type of delivery, family history of thyroid disease, and chronic diseases, contributed in identifying infants with a high risk of CH. Conclusions Results showed acceptable capabilities to analyze CH screening data for the SVM-Bagging technique. This method can be considered as a diagnostic tool to assist experts in recognizing infants suspected of having the disease, and can increase the effectiveness and accuracy of diagnosis and treatment of CH at an early stage. This also reduces costs of postnatal therapy as compared with CH when diagnosed at later stages.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.imu.2019.100281", "venue": null, "journal": "Informatics in Medicine Unlocked", "mag_id": "2996025931", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214044713"}

In real scenarios, most domain adaptation algorithms face the challenges from noisy, insufficient training data and open set categorization. In such cases, conventional methods suffer from overfitting and fail to successfully transfer the knowledge of the source to the target domain. To address these issues, the following two techniques are proposed. First, we introduce the optimized decision tree construction method with convolutional neural networks, in which the data at each node are split into equal sizes while maximizing the information gain. It generates balanced decision trees on deep features because of the even-split constraint, which contributes to enhanced discrimination power and reduced overfitting problem. Second, to tackle the domain misalignment problem, we propose the domain alignment loss which penalizes uneven splits of the source and target domain data. By collaboratively optimizing the information gain of the labeled source data as well as the entropy of unlabeled target data distributions, the proposed CoBRF algorithm achieves significantly better performance than the state-of-the-art methods.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2002.03642", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3000742731", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6755881", "4357800", "46784066", "104291876", "51729348", "17169365", "556999", "745350", "12757870", "11758569", "10627900", "4547917", "19059279", "52833113", "53979606", "4445132", "13817347", "55701085", "19120162", "46895919", "13752992", "19598463", "140293289", "3471181", "69357784", "6349961", "21042607", "15014140", "3194147", "89141", "10603765", "206765531", "34264804", "12096421", "21671230", "35517251", "2658359", "21040917", "18014460", "2658359", "17584818", "12726540", "6186381", "206787478", "2928248", "51876228", "206594692", "207763512"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211069682"}

This is essential for text understanding, given the limited coverage of proper nouns in lexical resources such as WordNet. Previous methods that use lexical patterns to discover hypernyms suffer from limited precision and recall. We present methods based on lexical patterns that find hypernyms of arbitrary noun phrases with high precision. This more than doubles the recall of proper noun hypernyms provided by WordNet at a modest cost to precision. We also present a novel method using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to extend recall further. Introduction and Motivation A goal of \u201cMachine Reading\u201d is an automatic system that extracts information from text and supports a wide range of inferencing capabilities (Etzioni, Banko, and Cafarella 2006). To enable such inferencing, an Information Extraction (IE) system must go beyond representing extracted entities as text strings and ontologize the text strings (Pennacchiotti and Pantel 2006; Soderland and Mandhani 2007). This involves semantically typing the text strings, grounding the string in real world entities where possible, and mapping the string to a concept in a formal taxonomy. In many cases, particularly for proper nouns, the text string is not found in an existing taxonomy and must be added on the fly as a child of an existing concept. This paper focuses on just one step in this ontologizing process: finding hypernyms for an arbitrary noun phrase (NP). This is a necessary first step in semantically typing the NP and mapping it to a node in a taxonomy. The problem that we address here is as follows. Given an NP e, find a set of NPs ci such that each ci is a hypernym of e in some sense as judged by a human. hypernymOf(e) = {c1, c2, ...ck} Note that we define hypernymy as a relation between surface forms and not \u201csynsets\u201d, as is done in WordNet. Copyright c \u00a9 2009, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. Consider the example of an NP extracted from the Web, \u201cBorland Delphi\u201d. This term is not found in WordNet, but lexical patterns in a large corpus suggest that Borland Delphi may have the following hypernyms: hypernymOf(Borland Delphi) = development environment = software development system = software tool = language = technology The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We discuss previous attempts at solving this problem. The manually engineered WordNet thesaurus (Miller et al. 1990) has good coverage of common nouns, but contains relatively few entries for Proper Nouns. Several researchers have used methods based on lexical patterns to discover hypernyms (Hearst 1992; Roark and Charniak 1998; Caraballo 1999; Snow, Jurafsky, and Ng 2005), although each of these methods suffers from limited precision and recall. We then present a series of methods for finding hypernyms of arbitrary NPs: HYPERNYMFINDERfreq which is based on the frequency of Hearst pattern matches and HYPERNYMFINDERsvm that uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to incorporate additional features. Each of these systems learns to find hypernyms from lexical patterns and corpus statistics. Since this is an inherently error-prone process, each version of HYPERNYMFINDER assigns a probability to each ci it finds. Finally, we present HYPERNYMFINDERhmm, which uses an HMM language model to extend the recall of HYPERNYMFINDER to cover NPs that do not match any of the lexical patterns used by the previous versions. Previous Work on Hypernym Discovery The WordNet thesaurus (Miller et al. 1990) is a highprecision lexical resource that has served as a baseline for hypernym discovery since the 1990\u2019s. On a test set of 953 Noun phrases randomly selected from our Web corpus, we found that only 17% of the proper nouns and 64% of the common nouns were covered by WordNet. Information is often spotty even for NPs that are found in WordNet. For example, WordNet has an entry for \u201cMel Gibson\u201d as an instance of the class \u201cactor\u201d, a subclass of \u201chuman\u201d, but does not indicate that he is a \u201cman\u201d.

Therefore, ELM training is essentially a linear learning problem, which significantly reduces the computational burden. Numerous applications show that such a computation burden reduction does not degrade the generalization capability. It has, however, been open that whether this is true in theory. The aim of our work is to study the theoretical feasibility of ELM by analyzing the pros and cons of ELM. In the previous part on this topic, we pointed out that via appropriate selection of the activation function, ELM does not degrade the generalization capability in the expectation sense. In this paper, we launch the study in a different direction and show that the randomness of ELM also leads to certain negative consequences. On one hand, we find that the randomness causes an additional uncertainty problem of ELM, both in approximation and learning. On the other hand, we theoretically justify that there also exists an activation function such that the corresponding ELM degrades the generalization capability. In particular, we prove that the generalization capability of ELM with Gaussian kernel is essentially worse than that of FNN with Gaussian kernel.

However, the interference from human movements in the reading zone is a challenge to result in false positives. To address this problem, we first compute virtual displacements of the target RFID tag and then adopt Support Vector Machines to recognize absence or presence of human motion near the tag. Next, we divide the surveillance region into mm-level grids to construct similarity matrixes of the tracked tag before and after human motion, which can accurately distinguish absence or presence of tag motion. Indeed, the optimization method based on phase-ambiguity is introduced to reduce computations. The results show that our method can achieve the average scenario classification accuracy of 96.3 % and the average slight tag motion perception accuracy of 100 % with the hypersensitivity of 1 mm.

Assets of road signs represent a substantial investment of roadway agencies. Proper sign maintenance and inventory is an essential tool for infrastructure management and maintenance. Currently, sign inventory is mostly conducted by human observation of the digital images of roadway scene, or commonly called Right-of-Way imaging. Automated system would substantially improve the processing speed and accuracy of two key processing tasks, sign detection and sign classification, since the human observation of the large amount of images is tedious, error-prone and time-consuming. This paper emphasizes on the study of sign classification. Classification is to categorize signs into proper classes, which is an important process and substantially more difficult for automation than sign detection in a sign inventory system. The most frequently used technique used in previous research for classification is neural network. However, neural network might suffer from the local minimum problem if the training data are not properly picked. In addition, neural network is lack of explainable inner theoretical rule which bring difficulty to fine tune the performance of the model. This paper presents a method which combines feature extraction, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and multi-class classification. SVM is a statistical learning method based on Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension and structural minimum principle (1). It is designed to overcome the aforementioned two drawbacks of neural network method.

During the nuclear reactor fuel reloading operation periodically executed in Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs), part of the nuclear fuel is substituted. It is a realworld problem studied for more than four decades and several techniques have been used for its solution, such as optimization techniques and human expert knowledge. For example, early applications of Mathematical Programming methods for the solution of the ICFMO were made with Dynamic Programming (Wall & Fenech, 1965), and with Linear and Quadratic Programming (Tabak, 1968). The ICFMO presents characteristics such as high-dimensionality, the large number of feasible solutions, disconnected feasible regions in the search space (Stevens et al., 1995) as well as the high computational cost of the evaluation function and lack of derivative information, which contribute to the challenge of the optimization of the ICFMO. Notwithstanding, algorithms known as generic heuristic methods, or metaheuristics (Taillard et al., 2001), have demonstrated an outstanding capability of dealing with complex search spaces, specially in the case of the ICFMO. Such Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, besides the low coupling to the specificities of the problems, have some characteristics such as the memorization of solutions (or characteristics of solutions), which allows the algorithm to retain intrinsic patterns of optimal or near-optimal solutions or, in other words, \u201cinner\u201d heuristics as described by Gendreau & Potvin (2005). As search methodologies, metaheuristics may have in common: diversification, in order to to explore different areas; mechanisms of intensification, in order to exploit specific areas of the search space; memory, in order to retain the best solutions; and tuning of parameters (Siarry & Zbigniew, 2008). Metaheuristics such as Simulated Annealing (SA; Kirkpatrick et al., 1983), Genetic Algorithm (GA; Goldberg, 1989), Population-Based Incremental Learning (PBIL; Baluja, 1994), Ant Colony System (ACS; Dorigo & Gambardella, 1997) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO; Kennedy & Eberhart, 2001) have been applied to several problems in different areas with considerable success.

CCRFs organize all tags in a hierarchy and run CRFs on each node of the hierarchy.

The standard codecs employed by these systems remove spatio-temporal redundancies to minimize the bandwidth required. However, this increases the exposure of the system to transmission errors, thus presenting a significant degradation in perceptual quality of the reconstructed video sequences. A number of mechanisms were investigated in the past to make these codecs more robust against transmission errors. Nevertheless, these techniques achieved little success, forcing the transmission to be held at lower bit-error rates (BERs) to guarantee acceptable quality. This paper presents a novel solution to this problem based on the error detection capabilities of the transport protocols to identify potentially corrupted group-of-blocks (GOBs). The algorithm uses a support vector machine (SVM) at its core to localize visually impaired macroblocks (MBs) that require concealment within these GOBs. Hence, this method drastically reduces the region to be concealed compared to state-of-the-art error resilient strategies which assume a packet loss scenario. Testing on a standard H.263++ codec confirms that a significant gain in quality is achieved with error detection rates of 97.8% and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) gains of up to 5.33 dB.

Conventional Distance Sampling (CDS) and the Delta approach on Random Forest (DaRF) methods have been applied to sightings data collected between 2009 and 2016 during standardized vessel-based surveys, providing similar outcomes. The mean value of density over the entire study area was 0.72 \u00b1 0.26 specimens/km 2 for the striped dolphin and 0.47 \u00b1 0.09 specimens/km 2 for the common bottlenose dolphin. The abundance estimated by DaRF in the Gulf of Taranto was 10080 \u00b1 3584 specimens of S. coeruleoalba and 6580 \u00b1 1270 specimens of T. truncatus , respectively. Eight predictive variables were selected, considering both the local physiographic features and human activities existing in the investigated area. The explanatory variables depth, distance from the coast, distance from industrial areas and distance from areas exploited by fishery seem to play a key role in influencing the spatial distribution of both species, whereas the geomorphological variables proved to be the most significant factors shaping the concentration of both dolphins.

Following, the support vector machine (SVM) was applied to the fault pattern recognition. The energy-entropy based genetic algorithm was used to optimize the SVM parameters. The experimental vibration data measured on a mine hoist test rig was used to evaluate the proposed method.

Avoiding a bias towards the majority class(es) in a data set, AFMA can significantly improve recall of a given important-and- minor(MAI) class whilst maintaining the overall accuracy.

The application of traditional methods of model fitting and colour-colour selections will face significant computational constraints, while machine-learning (ML) methods offer a viable approach to tackle datasets of that volume. While supervised learning methods can perform very well for classification tasks, the creation of representative and accurate training sets is a resource and time consuming task. We present a viable alternative using an unsupervised ML method to separate stars, galaxies and QSOs using photometric data. The heart of our work uses HDBSCAN to find the star, galaxy and QSO clusters in a multidimensional colour space. We optimized the hyperparameters and input attributes of three separate HDBSCAN runs, each to select a particular object class, and thus treat the output of each separate run as a binary classifier. We subsequently consolidate the output to give our final classifications, optimized on their F1 scores. We explore the use of Random Forest and PCA as part of the pre-processing stage for feature selection and dimensionality reduction. Using our dataset of 50,000 spectroscopically labelled objects we obtain an F1 score of 98.9, 98.9 and 93.13 respectively for star, galaxy and QSO selection using our unsupervised learning method. We find that careful attribute selection is a vital part of accurate classification with HDBSCAN. We applied our classification to a subset of the SDSS spectroscopic catalogue and demonstrate the potential of our approach in correcting misclassified spectra useful for DESI and 4MOST.

References, typically appearing at the end of journal articles, can also provide valuable information for extracting other bibliographic data. Therefore, parsing individual reference to extract author, title, journal, year, etc. is sometimes a necessary preprocessing step in building citation-indexing systems. The regular structure in references enables us to consider reference parsing a sequence learning problem and to study structural Support Vector Machine (structural SVM), a newly developed structured learning algorithm on parsing references.ResultsIn this study, we implemented structural SVM and used two types of contextual features to compare structural SVM with conventional SVM. Both methods achieve above 98% token classification accuracy and above 95% overall chunk-level accuracy for reference parsing. We also compared SVM and structural SVM to Conditional Random Field (CRF). The experimental results show that structural SVM and CRF achieve similar accuracies at token- and chunk-levels.ConclusionsWhen only basic observation features are used for each token, structural SVM achieves higher performance compared to SVM since it utilizes the contextual label features. However, when the contextual observation features from neighboring tokens are combined, SVM performance improves greatly, and is close to that of structural SVM after adding the second order contextual observation features. The comparison of these two methods with CRF using the same set of binary features show that both structural SVM and CRF perform better than SVM, indicating their stronger sequence learning ability in reference parsing.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3111593", "pubmed_id": "21658294", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-12-S3-S7", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2130371208", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["14621100", "7254202", "14869976", "4667931", "2074297", "10879194", "11453237", "16261927", "43443710", "9572594", "141747", "564746", "14211670", "961425", "277918", "59921147", "5886719"], "inbound_citations": ["17892962", "199508880", "195346555", "1355032", "56332083", "111287855", "5886719", "17230974", "4968904", "53947990"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5886719"}

This often results in many tens to hundreds of candidates whose presence and concentration must be verified in blood, the biofluid of choice, prior to developing a clinical assay. Historically, verification was performed using antibodies; however, the required immunoassay-grade reagents necessary for sensitive and specific detection in blood only exist for a tiny fraction of the proteome. Thus, alternative technologies are required to bridge the gap between discovery and clinical assay development. ::: Targeted hypothesis-driven mass spectrometry is increasingly being used to verify changes in protein response due to disease or therapy. These methods require selecting \"signature\" peptides as detectable and quantifiable surrogates for each protein. Peptides that produce the highest ion-current response are ideal choices as they are more sensitively detected. Unfortunately, selection of these peptides, particularly in the absence of experimental data, is a challenging problem and represents a significant resource constraint in targeted assay development by mass spectrometry. ::: This thesis describes the development of the Enhanced Signature Peptide (ESP) predictor, a computational method to predict high-responding peptides from a given protein. I used an MS-based analysis of yeast to define a training set and took advantage of the theoretical properties of the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, an ensemble of individual classification trees, to model peptide response. On average, the ESP predictor achieves a success rate of 89% at selecting one or more high-responding peptides per protein. More importantly, we applied the ESP predictor to select de novo signature peptides and show that it correctly selected 74% of experimentally validated signature peptides (2 peptides per protein on average). Furthermore, the ESP predictor is a robust model that, unlike existing computational methods, performs well across all common electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS experimental types. The ESP predictor fills a critical gap, enabling selection of optimal candidate signature peptides to detect and quantify any protein of interest in the absence of MS experimental data.

The EEG signals are initially segmented in nonoverlapping epochs of different lengths ranging from 5 s to 12 s.

{"paper_id": "107568989", "title": "Predicting corporate failure through a combination of intelligent techniques", "authors": [{"first": "Sverre", "middle": ["Edvard"], "last": "Gunnersen", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "Corporate failure is one of the most popular prediction problems because early identification of at-risk companies presents such a clear economic benefit to creditors, investors and society as a whole. Throughout the years statistically based classification systems, intelligent systems such as Neural Networks with its many variants, and newer techniques such as Genetic Programming have been applied to this problem. Indeed when a new variation or technique is proposed, the prediction of corporate failure is often one of the first test domains for the new methodology. Likewise, the cause of corporate failure is a topic that has received much academic and literary attention, including case studies investigating the trajectories that failing companies take or post hoc qualitative analysis as to whether certain fundamental causes such as one-man-rule can be attributed to the subsequent collapse of a company. However, throughout the history of this topic a number of challenges emerge that remain unaddressed within the literature. The first challenge is that while many papers outlining new classification techniques compare results with another popular classification system as a baseline, little research exists that comprehensively compares many classification techniques across multiple datasets. This thesis finds that intelligent techniques such as Neural Networks, Genetic Programming and Support Vector Machines outperform statistical techniques such as Discriminant Analysis and Logistic Regression. The second challenge is that the desire of researchers to compare results has resulted in the use of the same cross-section of factors, with little analysis as to whether or not the factors being used are impacting on the classification accuracy of the method. This thesis finds that an objective factor selection methodology leads to performance gains. The third is that far less research exists that considers whether share market or macroeconomic data can have a positive impact on classification accuracy. While this research did find some performance gains when including share market information, the difficulty of linking financial information with share market information leads to data loss that outweighs the small performance improvement. The fourth is that while most classificatory research on this problem focuses on the accuracy of the technique, less attention is given to whether the subjective clustering methods used (e.g. by \u201cindustry\u201d) are effective, and this research finds that an objective clustering technique improves classification accuracy. Furthermore, this research builds on the existing cluster visualisation methods by developing a new and more effective cluster visualisation algorithm. Finally this research attempts to contribute to the theoretical understanding of corporate failure by analysing the classificatory surface of the resulting predictive models and performing a case study analysis of failed companies. In doing so, the model\u2019s strengths and limitations are discussed and some of the causes of failure from the literature are identified. In summary, this research makes the following contributions to the field of bankruptcy prediction: a literature review of notable bankruptcy prediction research, a comparison of popular classification techniques, the development and testing of a new objective factor selection methodology, an examination of the effect of share market and macroeconomic data on classification accuracy, the development and testing of a new cluster visualisation method that overcomes limitations in existing methods, an examination of the effect of objective clustering on classification accuracy utilising the new visualisation method, and a case-study analysis on selected failed companies that relates the reasons for failure outlined in secondary sources to the company\u2019s failure prediction trajectory.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "261988325", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:107568989"}

The proposed framework generates predictions in three phases. Firstly, emotions are detected in the input speech signal by classifying it as neutral or emotional. If the speech is classified as emotional, then in the second phase, it is further classified into positive and negative classes. Finally, individual positive or negative emotions are identified based on the outcomes of the previous stages. Several experiments have been performed on a widely used benchmark dataset.

GANs has been successfully applied to many fields such as computer vision, pattern recognition, natural language processing and so on. By now many kinds of extended models of GANs have been proposed and investigated by different researchers from different viewpoints. Although there are a few review papers on the extended models of GANs in the literature, some remarkable extensions of GANs published in the recent years are not included in these surveys.

A novel molecular detector is used--one based on current blockade measurements through a nanometer-scale ion channel (alpha-hemolysin). Classification results are described for blockades caused by DNA molecules in the alpha-hemolysin nanopore detector, with signal analysis and pattern recognition performed using a combination of methods from bioinformatics and machine learning. Due to the size of the alpha-hemolysin protein channel, the blockade events report on one DNA molecule at a time, which enables a variety of reproducible, single-molecule biophysical experiments. To capture the full sensitivity of the nanopore detector's blockade signal, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) were used with Expectation/Maximization for denoising and for associating a feature vector with the ionic current blockade of each captured DNA molecule. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) that employ novel kernel designs were then used as discriminators. With SVM training performed off-line, and economical HMM processing on-line, blockade classification was possible during capture. HMMs were also used in conjunction with a time-domain finite state automaton (off-line) for feature discovery and kinetics analysis. Analysis of the DNA data indicates a variety of binding (DNA-protein), fraying, and conformational shifts that are consistent with data obtained from thermodynamic analyses (melting curves), X-ray crystallography, and NMR studies.

The number of SNPs that have been found in human genome and affect protein functionality is constantly increasing. Finding matches between SNPs and diseases using experimental techniques, is excessive disadvantageous in terms of time and cost. For this reason, several computational methods have been developed. These methods classify polymorphisms as pathogenic and non-pathogenic. Most of them use classifiers, which take as input a set of structural, functional, sequential and evolutionary features and predict whether a single nucleotide polymorphism is pathogenic or neutral. For training these classifiers use two sets of SNPs. The first one consists of SNPs that have been experimentally proven as pathogenic, whereas the second set consists of SNPs that have been experimentally characterized as benign. These methods differ in the classification methods they deploy and in the features they use as inputs. However, the main problem is the determination of an empirically verified set of features for training. Specifically, different methods suggest different feature sets, without adequately documenting the causes of this differentiation. In addition, the existing methodologies do not tackle efficiently the class imbalance problem between positive and negative training sets and the problem of missing values in the datasets. ::: In this thesis a new hybrid computational intelligence methodology is proposed, that overcomes many of the problems of existing methodologies. The proposed method achieves high classification performance and systematizes the selection of relevant features. In the first phase of this study the polymorphisms were gathered from the available public databases and they were used for training and testing of the machine learning models. Specifically, the positive and negative training and test sets were collected and filtered. They consist of single nucleotide polymorphisms that lead to either pathogenesis or are neutral. For each polymorphism of the two sets, using existing available tools, a wide range of structural, functional, sequential and evolutionary features were calculated. For those features for which there was no available tool, the suitable program (code) was developed in order to compute them. ::: In the second step a new embedded hybrid classification method called EnsembleGASVR is designed and implemented. The method uses an ensemble methodology, based on hybrid combination of Genetic Algorithms and nu-Support Vector Regression (nu-SVR) models. An Adaptive Genetic Algorithm is used to determine the optimal subset of features and the optimal values of the parameters of classifiers. We propose the nu-SVR classifier, since it exhibits high performance, good generalization ability, it is not trapped in local optima and achieves a balance between accuracy and complexity of the model. In order to overcome the problem of missing values and class imbalance, we extended the above algorithm to function as a collective ensemble-technique, combining eight individual classification models. In overall, the method achieves 87.45% accuracy, 71.78% sensitivity and 93.16% specificity. These priliminary results are very promising and shows that EnsembleGASVR methodology significantly outperforms other well-known classification methods for pathogenic mutations.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "365681675", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:83019308"}

Most of these CNN based methods focus on learning a model to map a low-resolution (LR) image to a high-resolution (HR) image, where the LR image is downsampled from the HR image with a known model. However, in a more general case when the process of the down-sampling is unknown and the LR input is degraded by noises and blurring, it is difficult to acquire the LR and HR image pairs for traditional supervised learning. Inspired by the recent unsupervised image-style translation applications using unpaired data, we propose a multiple Cycle-in-Cycle network structure to deal with the more general case using multiple generative adversarial networks (GAN) as the basis components. The first network cycle aims at mapping the noisy and blurry LR input to a noise-free LR space, then a new cycle with a well-trained $\\times 2$ network model is orderly introduced to super-resolve the intermediate output of the former cycle. The number of total cycles depends on the different up-sampling factors ( $\\times 2$ , $\\times 4$ , $\\times 8$ ).

Biological data often consist of redundant and irrelevant features. These features can lead to misleading in modeling the algorithms and overfitting problem. Without a feature selection method, it is difficult for the existing models to accurately capture the patterns on data. The aim of feature selection is to choose a small number of relevant or significant features to enhance the performance of the classification. Existing feature selection methods suffer from the problems such as becoming stuck in local optima and being computationally expensive. To solve these problems, an efficient global search technique is needed.Black Hole Algorithm (BHA) is an efficient and new global search technique, inspired by the behavior of black hole, which is being applied to solve several optimization problems. However, the potential of BHA for feature selection has not been investigated yet. This paper proposes a Binary version of Black Hole Algorithm called BBHA for solving feature selection problem in biological data. The BBHA is an extension of existing BHA through appropriate binarization. Moreover, the performances of six well-known decision tree classifiers (Random Forest (RF), Bagging, C5.0, C4.5, Boosted C5.0, and CART) are compared in this study to employ the best one as an evaluator of proposed algorithm.The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested upon eight publicly available biological datasets and is compared with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Simulated Annealing (SA), and Correlation based Feature Selection (CFS) in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and Area Under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC). In order to verify the applicability and generality of the BBHA, it was integrated with Naive Bayes (NB) classifier and applied on further datasets on the text and image domains.The experimental results confirm that the performance of RF is better than the other decision tree algorithms and the proposed BBHA wrapper based feature selection method is superior to BPSO, GA, SA, and CFS in terms of all criteria. BBHA gives significantly better performance than the BPSO and GA in terms of CPU Time, the number of parameters for configuring the model, and the number of chosen optimized features. Also, BBHA has competitive or better performance than the other methods in the literature.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.asoc.2017.03.002", "venue": "Appl.

In detail, the ensemble empirical mode decomposition algorithm was applied to decompose the multi-channel vibration signals in the switchover process of the on-load tap changer. Then, a Volterra model for the mechanical state of the on-load tap changer was established based on time-frequency characteristics obtained through the use of the ensemble empirical mode decomposition algorithm. Moreover, a matrix of coefficient vectors was also used in the Volterra model. This method will not only reduce the aliasing effect of empirical mode decomposition but also obtain high-resolution characteristics of nonstationary vibration signals. Furthermore, taking the singular values of the Volterra coefficient matrix as the fault characteristic, the data states of the model for diagnosing the on-load tap changer were automatically classified and identified by establishing a rapid, multi-classification decision acyclic graph support vector machine model with a low misjudgment rate. Finally, based on a certain on-load tap changer, the test platform for simulating mechanical faults was built. On this basis, by using the proposed method, the vibration signals generated due to typical mechanical faults, such as loosening of moving contacts, lessening of transition contact, and motor jam were acquired and analyzed, thus validating the effectiveness of the method through case studies.

Since manually collecting acronyms and their corresponding expansions from the documents is difficult, automatically building such a dictionary using supervised learning is the need of the hour. In this work, we focus on the acronym search problem: Given acronyms as queries, finding their corresponding expansions in a document. Recent works formulate the given problem as a token-level sequence labelling task and employ Hidden Markov Model, or Conditional Random Fields, to tackle the problem. However, these models do not utilize the segment level information inherent in the expansion. Hence we propose a Semi-Markov Conditional Random Field based approach for the given problem, that gives us power to write more effective features that work on a group of neighbouring tokens together than the features working on individual tokens.

The ensemble approach was tested using one artificial and five measured data sets of leaf level spectra and corresponding information on leaf chlorophyll, dry matter, and water content. PLSR models optimized for the goodness of fit, an established approach for band selection, were used to evaluate the performance of the ensemble. Although the fits of the models within the ensemble were poorer than the fits achieved with the reference approach, the ensemble was able to provide a band selection with higher consistency across all data sets. Due to the selection characteristics of the methods within the ensemble, the ensemble selection is moderately narrow and restrictive but in good agreement with known absorption features published in literature. We conclude that analyzing the range of agreement of different model types is an efficient way to select a robust set of spectral bands related to the foliar properties under investigation.

To achieve coherent representations, the human brain uses statistical dependencies to guide weighting of local feature conjunctions. Pairwise interactions among feature detectors in early visual areas may form the early substrate of these local feature bindings. To investigate local interaction structures in visual cortex, we combined psychophysical experiments with computational modeling and natural scene analysis. We first measured contrast thresholds for 2x2 grating patch arrangements (plaids), which differed in spatial frequency composition (low, high or mixed), number of grating patch co-alignments (0, 1 or 2), and inter-patch distances (1\u00b0 and 2\u00b0 of visual angle). Contrast thresholds for the different configurations were compared to the prediction of probability summation (PS) among detector families tuned to the four retinal positions. For 1\u00b0 distance the thresholds for all configurations were larger than predicted by PS, indicating inhibitory interactions. For 2\u00b0 distance, thresholds were significantly lower compared to PS when the plaids were homogeneous in spatial frequency and orientation, but not when spatial frequencies were mixed or there was at least one misalignment. Next, we constructed a neural population model with horizontal laminar structure, which reproduced the detection thresholds after adaptation of connection weights. Consistent with prior work, contextual interactions were medium-range inhibition and long-range, orientation-specific excitation. However, inclusion of orientation-specific, inhibitory interactions between populations with different spatial frequency preferences were crucial for explaining detection thresholds. Finally, for all plaid configurations we computed their likelihood of occurrence in natural images. The likelihoods turned out to be inversely related to the detection thresholds obtained at larger inter-patch distances. However, likelihoods were almost independent of inter-patch distance, implying that natural image statistics could not explain the crowding-like results at short distances. This failure of natural image statistics to resolve the patch distance modulation of plaid visibility remains a challenge to the approach.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5048088", "pubmed_id": "27757076", "doi": "10.3389/fnsys.2016.00078", "venue": "Front.

The performance of OS-ELM and Fuzzy-ELM are evaluated and compared with other popular sequential learning algorithms, and experimental results on some real benchmark regression problems show that the proposedOnlineSequentialExtreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) produces better generalization performance at very fast learning speed.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "Computational Intelligence", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "31566076", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["15589402", "11518324", "210988381", "10147945", "117089756", "16907717", "9550554", "9158822", "14157556"], "inbound_citations": ["52164862", "16357650", "207878153", "51845093", "3010769", "18461971", "115450920", "64066219", "39364957", "4711819", "2891159", "17743984", "155108740", "206919556", "39844174", "58941630", "56597322", "192641107", "12510650", "26107176", "8031115", "21916847", "2262262", "46756541", "52018748", "820123", "167210933", "98814895", "5117817", "139622869", "202558155", "207427780", "17292559", "14084223", "46971492", "27989991", "201813623", "155575681", "85525376", "19416759", "3739893", "61811285", "207109120", "21022484", "52986080", "213474026", "25310449", "3852306", "53016228", "11894091", "17473439", "204512659", "14375665", "18040247", "3037348", "26758052", "32325518", "13306516", "3549714", "195224792", "11981080", "32101804", "67397688", "207147662", "12969278", "2598890", "25954224", "9732890", "52291128", "208539062", "7028394", "19460947", "4990584", "25207740", "7054374", "19489397", "53422779", "648613", "209457991", "17437014", "51615688", "998363", "7272861", "14212204", "14368862", "14845587", "211003121"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:760370"}

Compared to previous method based on \u201cbag of words\u201d (BOW) model, this study uniquely identifies the enrichment protocol and learns how semantically different aspects of feature selection such as BOW (feature F0), term frequency inverse document frequency (TF-IDF, feature F1), and latent semantic indexing (LSI, feature F2) when applied sequentially with classifier improves the overall performance. Methods To study this enrichment concept, our ML model is tested on two kinds of diverse data sets: (i) D1: Disease data with conjunctivitis, diarrhea, stomach ache, cough and nausea related tweets, and (ii) D2: WebKB4 dataset, while adapting three kind of classifiers (a) C1: support vector machine with radial basis function (SVMR), (b) C2: Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and (c) C3: Random Forest (RF). Partition protocol (K10) was adapted with different performance metrics to evaluate machine learning (ML)-system. Results Using the combination of F1, C1, D1, K10, ML accuracy was: 94%, while with F2, C1, D1, K10, ML accuracy was 97%. Using the incremental feature enrichment from F0 to F2, K10 protocol gave F1 improvement over F0 by 4.98% on Disease dataset, while F2 improvement over F0 was by 11.78% on WebKB4 dataset. We demonstrated the generalization over memorization process in our ML-design. The system was tested for stability and reliability.

In this work, we propose to go a step further in this direction by modeling spatial relations among different detector responses. We use Random Forests in order to discriminatively select spatial relations which represent frequent co-occurrences of detector responses. We demonstrate our idea in the specific people detection framework, which is a challenging classification task due to the variability of the human body articulations and appearance, and we use the recently proposed poselets as our basic object dictionary. The use of poselets is not the only possible, actually the proposed method can be applied more in general since few assumptions are made on the basic object detector.

While most of the changes are optically visible and easily detectable by an expert user, automatic processes that remain valid even when different kinds of input data are considered, are quite difficult to develop. This paper provides new solutions for semi-automatic 3D change detection of buildings based on the joint use of height and spatial information. It is an attempt to build a reliable scheme for change detection able to process high as well as lower quality Digital Surface Models (DSMs). The subtraction of DSM, computed from stereo pairs acquired at different epochs, provide valuable information about 3D urban change. However, when at least one of the DSMs presents some artifacts, a simple DSM subtraction may result also in the detection of virtual changes.

The first one maps the raw data to a lower dimension using edge histogram based feature descriptors. The second component uses a possibilistic K-Nearest Neighbors (pK-NN) classifier to assign a confidence value. In this paper we show that performance of the baseline EHD could be improved by replacing the pK-NN classifier with model based classifiers. In particular, we investigate two such classifiers: Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Relevance Vector Machines (RVM). We investigate the adaptation of these classifiers to the landmine detection problem with GPR, and we compare their performance to the baseline EHD with a pK-NN classifier. As in the baseline EHD, we treat the problem as a two class classification problem: mine vs. clutter. Model parameters for the SVR and the RVM classifiers are estimated from training data using logarithmic grid search. For testing, soft labels are assigned to the test alarms. A confidence of zero indicates the maximum probability of being a false alarm. Similarly, a confidence of one represents the maximum probability of being a mine.

Existing decision support systems of patient referral are based on the expert systems approach. This usually requires manual updates when changes in clinical practices occur. Automatically updating the decision support system by identifying and handling so-called concept drift improves the efficiency of healthcare systems. In the stateof-the- art, there are only specific ways of handling concept drift; developing a more generic technique which works regardless of restrictions on how slow, fast, sudden, gradual, local, global, cyclical, noisy or otherwise changes in internal distribution, is still a challenge. Objectives: An algorithm that handles concept drift in surgery prediction is investigated. Concept drift detection techniques are evaluated to find out a suitable detection technique in the context of surgery prediction. Moreover, a plausible combination of detection and handling algorithms including the proposed algorithm, Trigger Based Ensemble (TBE)+, are evaluated on hospital data. Method: Experiments are conducted to investigates the impact of concept drift on prediction performance and to reduce concept drift impact. The experiments compare three existing methods (AWE, Active Classifier, Learn++) and the proposed algorithm, Trigger Based Ensemble(TBE). Real-world dataset from orthopedics department of Belkinge hospital and other domain dataset are used in the experiment. Results: The negative impact of concept drift in surgery prediction is investigated. The relationship between temporal changes in data distribution and surgery prediction concept drift is identified. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is evaluated and compared with existing handling approaches. Conclusion: The proposed algorithm, Trigger Based Ensemble (TBE), is capable of detecting the occurrences of concept drifts and to adapt quickly to various changes. The Trigger Based Ensemble algorithm performed comparatively better or sometimes similar to the existing concept drift handling algorithms in the absence of noise. Moreover, the performance of Trigger Based Ensemble is consistent for small and large dataset.

The performance of CRC method dramatically decreases when the feature dimension is low or the number of training samples per subject is limited.

However, due to the time-consuming and high cost constraints of biological experimental methods, traditional drug target identification technologies are often difficult to develop on a large scale. Therefore, in silico methods are urgently needed to predict drug-target interactions in a genome-wide manner. In this article, we design a new in silico approach, named RFDTI to predict the DTIs combine Feature weighted Rotation Forest (FwRF) classifier with protein amino acids information. This model has two outstanding advantages: a) using the fusion data of protein sequence and drug molecular fingerprint, which can fully carry information; b) using the classifier with feature selection ability, which can effectively remove noise information and improve prediction performance. More specifically, we first use Position-Specific Score Matrix (PSSM) to numerically convert protein sequences and utilize Pseudo Position-Specific Score Matrix (PsePSSM) to extract their features. Then a unified digital descriptor is formed by combining molecular fingerprints representing drug information. Finally, the FwRF is applied to implement on Enzyme, Ion Channel, GPCR, and Nuclear Receptor data sets. The results of the five-fold cross-validation experiment show that the prediction accuracy of this approach reaches 91.68%, 88.11%, 84.72% and 78.33% on four benchmark data sets, respectively. To further validate the performance of the RFDTI, we compare it with other excellent methods and Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.

Data were extracted from the Ecologische Karakterisering van Oppervlaktewateren in Overijssel (EKOO) database, consisting of 249 lotic study sites (including springs, upper, middle and lower courses) and 690 species. Exergy values were calculated based on trophic groups (carnivores, detritivores, detriti-herbivores, herbivores and omnivores) of benthic macroinvertebrate communities. A Self-Organizing Map (SOM) was applied to characterize the different benthic macroinvertebrate communities in the lotic ecosystem, and the Random Forest model was used to predict the exergy and specific exergy based on environmental variables. The SOM classified the sampling sites into four clusters representing differences in the longitudinal distribution along the river, as well as along nutrient gradients. Exergy tended to increase with stream size, and specific exergy was lowest at sites with a high nutrient load. The Random Forest model results indicated that river width was the most important predictor of exergy followed by dissolved oxygen, ammonium and river depth. Orthophosphate was the most significant predictor for estimating specific exergy followed by nitrate and total phosphate.

In order to test the capabilities of the proposed approach, we carried out some experiments to evaluate the quality of the language model and the tagging accuracy of the system. These results are contrasted with the ones obtained using a tagger based on bigrams. The corpus used is a subset of the Spanish corpus LEXEP-I that consists of 84,286 words, a vocabulary of 14,000 words and a set of lexical units of 64; the average length of the sentences is about 28. The overall accuracy rate using ECGI is slightly worst than those obtained with bigrams. However, there are many developments that can be included in our system and we believe that our approach can be useful to get through this problem. 1. Part-Of-Speech Tagging Problem: An Overview Part-of-Speech tagging is a well-known disambiguation problem in Natural Language. A tagger can be considered as a translator that inputs strings from a certain language and outputs the corresponding sequence of lexical categories. Generally, these categories are taken from a set defined previously. When a word can be assigned to different lexical categories disambiguation is solved by using contextual information.. The tagging process involves two knowledge sources: the language model, which describes the possible (or probable) sequencing of the categories, and the lexical information, which represents the relationships between the vocabulary of the application and the set of categories. The different approaches to resolve this problems can be classified into two main classes (Samuelsson,1997) depending on the tendencies followed for establishing the language model: the linguistic approach, based on handcoded linguistic rules and the statistical approach, derived from a corpora (labelled or non-labelled). Also, other approximations that use hybrid methods are proposed (Voutilainen, 1997). In the linguistic approach, an expert linguistic is needed to formalise the restrictions of the language; this implies a very high cost and it is very dependent on every particular language. To solve this problem some supervised learning methods were proposed (Brill, 1995). The main advantage of previous approach is that the model is constructed from a linguistic point of view and contains many and complex kinds of knowledge. In the statistical approach the language model can be estimated from an unlabelled corpus (supervised methods) (Church, 1988; Weischedel, 1993) or from a non-labelled corpus (unsupervised methods) (Cutting et al., 1992). In the first case the model is trained from the relative observed frequencies. In the second one the model is estimated using the Baum-Welch algorithm from an initial model estimated using labelled corpora (Merialdo, 1994). The advantages of the unsupervised approach are the facility to build language models, the flexibility of choice of categories and the easy of application to other languages. Although the comparison among different approaches is difficult due to the multiple factors that can be considered: the language, the number of tags, the size of the vocabulary, the ambiguity, the difficulty of the test set, etc., a detailed comparison is presented in (Franz, 1996). The best results reported there using statistical language models have an accuracy between 95% and 97% (depending on the different factors above mentioned). For the linguistic approach the results are a bit better (Samuelsson, 1997). 2. Language Modeling and Grammatical Inference As we have pointed out above, the tendencies for establishing appropriate language models can be dichotomised into two main categories. The first one assumes that the given task is quite constrained, for this reason an a-priori formal grammar can be supplied. This grammar determines the possible or probable concatenations of Linguistic Units (LU s) for the acceptable sentences of the task (Syntactic Language Models). In the second group, the probable LU concatenations are modelled through the probabilities (frequencies) of occurrence of fixed length sequences of LU s, which are often called N-grams (N-grams Language Models). It is generally recognised that Syntactic Models are able to represent language constraints more naturally; however, these models are usually difficult to establish beforehand to account for given \"natural\" task languages, and often result in models too rigid to be useful in practical situations. N-grams models, on the other hand, have the appeal of allowing fully automatic training and being fairly tolerant to linguistically relaxed constructs, but they can hardly capture long-term relations between LU s, resulting in poor modelling of \"natural\" task language constraints. A novel framework for Language Modelling based on the use of Grammatical Inference (GI) Techniques was introduced in (Prieto, 1992) which aims at overcoming the main drawbacks of the above extremes, while retaining their principal merits. That is, while it adheres to the automatic trainability feature that is inherent to Ngrams models, it mainly aims at obtaining structural or syntactic representations of relations between the LU s considered, thus allowing for adequate modelling of long term (as well as short term) language constraints. This structural learning capability is based on the use of GI techniques. For a deep study of the applications and fundamentals of GI, can be consulted (Gonzalez, 1978) (Fu, 1975) (Fu, 1982), (Angluin, 1983) (Miclet, 1990) (Vidal, 1993). Some GI techniques that has been applied to language modelling are resumed in (Prieto, 1995).

Photovoltaic technologies have the advantage of a capillary distribution, but they are characterized by an intrinsic variable behavior due to continuously changing weather conditions. This drawback can be overcome by an appropriate temporal and energetic match among photovoltaic generation and storage capacity, so increasing micro grids reliability and efficiency levels. An accurate forecast of photovoltaic production can contribute to smooth photovoltaic systems intermittency problems so supporting generation and storage balance. Many different forecasting algorithms have been proposed in literature to provide long, medium and short-term predictions of photovoltaic production. A criterion for selection among them is not a priori and it is not uniquely identifiable. In this paper, the attention is focused on eleven data-driven models to obtain 12 h ahead forecast, also including some models not usually used in solar field but successfully employed in other expertise fields .

The goal is to compare methods characterized by different complexity levels to understand if a higher complexity model can provide better performances. Furthermore, the considered forecasting methodologies are compared applying two different training methodologies (online and offline) to identify the most performing training mode. The application of optimization algorithms permits to identify optima parameters and the optimum training dataset length for each model. After the optimization step, a statistical analysis is carried out to compare methods forecasting performances for the production of a 1 kW p photovoltaic plant installed at the ENEA Research Center of Portici. The case study results demonstrate promising forecasting performances applying the online training mode.

Environmental factors, including physico-chemical (i.e., dissolved oxygen (DO), electricity conductivity (EC), ammonia nitrogen (NH 3 -N), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand in five days (BOD 5 ), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN)) and hydromorphology parameters (i.e., water quantity, channel change, morphology diversity) were used as the input variables to train and validate the SVM model.

In order to overcome these drawbacks the use of near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) has been a low cost alternative to determine oil content and other seed quality traits. However, in order to implement accurate NIR based measurements, stable prediction models need to be developed.

Conventional methods such as discriminant analysis recently applied neural networks belong to the general class of Empirical Risk Minimization techniques which aim to minimize training error. On the other hand, methods built on support vector machines (SVMs) are based on the Structural Risk Minimization principle which in turn is based on statistical learning theory. Statistical learning enhancement gives better generalization abilities by minimizing the testing error. In this research, a new modeling framework based on SVMs is described to identify lithfacies from well logs. A SVM classification formulation is presented together with feature selection based on fuzzy theory to identify potential features to enable discriminatory power from well logs.

The proposed approach, termed as Subclass Reduced Set SVM (SRS-SVM), utilizes the subclass structure of data to effectively estimate the candidate support vector set. Since the candidate support vector set cardinality is only a fraction of the training set cardinality, learning SVM from the former requires less time without significantly changing the decision boundary. SRS-SVM depends on a domain knowledge related input parameter, i.e., number of subclasses. To reduce the domain knowledge dependency and to make the approach less sensitive to the subclass parameter, we extend the proposed SRS-SVM to create a robust and improved hierarchical model termed as the Hierarchical Subclass Reduced Set SVM (HSRS-SVM). Since SRS-SVM and HSRS-SVM splits non-linear optimization problem into multiple (smaller) linear optimization problems, both of them are amenable to parallelization. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is evaluated on four synthetic and six real-world datasets. The performance is also compared with traditional solver (LibSVM) and state-of-the-art approaches such as divide-and-conquer SVM, FastFood, and LLSVM. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves similar classification accuracies while requiring fewer folds of reduced computation time as compared to existing solvers.

However, current computerized systems are mainly based on group analysis, discrete classification of disease stages, or expensive and not readily accessible biomarkers, while current clinical practice relies relatively heavily on cognitive and functional assessments (CFA). In this study, we developed a computational framework using a suite of machine learning tools for identifying key markers in predicting the severity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from a large set of biological and clinical measures. Six machine learning approaches, namely Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), Support Vector Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbor for regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and k-Nearest Neighbor for classification, were used for the development of predictive models. We demonstrated high predictive power of CFA. Predictive performance of models incorporating CFA was shown to consistently have higher accuracy than those based solely on biomarker modalities. We found that KRR and SVM were the best performing regression and classification methods respectively. The optimal SVM performance was observed for a set of four CFA test scores (FAQ, ADAS13, MoCA, MMSE) with multi-class classification accuracy of 83.0%, 95%CI = (72.1%, 93.8%) while the best performance of the KRR model was reported with combined CFA and MRI neuroimaging data, i.e., R2 = 0.874, 95%CI = (0.827, 0.922). Given the high predictive power of CFA and their widespread use in clinical practice, we designed a data-driven and self-adaptive computerized clinical decision support system (CDSS) prototype for evaluating the severity of AD of an individual on a continuous spectrum.

Most existing popular text mining and classification methods have adopted term-based approaches. However, they have all suffered from the problems of polysemy and synonymy. Over the years, people have often held the hypothesis that pattern-based methods should perform better than term- based ones in describing user preferences, but many experiments do not support this hypothesis. This research presents a promising method, Relevance Feature Discovery (RFD), for solving this challenging issue. It discovers both positive and negative patterns in text documents as high-level features in order to accurately weight low-level features (terms) based on their specificity and their distributions in the high-level features. The thesis also introduces an adaptive model (called ARFD) to enhance the exibility of using RFD in adaptive environment. ARFD automatically updates the system's knowledge based on a sliding window over new incoming feedback documents. It can efficiently decide which incoming documents can bring in new knowledge into the system.

However, most of the current Intrusion Detection Systems(IDSs) focus on detail analysis of packet data, which results in late detection and a high system burden to cope with high-speed network environment. In this paper we propose a lightweight and fast detection mechanism for traffic flooding attacks. Firstly, we use SNMP MIB statistical data gathered from SNMP agents, instead of raw packet data from network links. Secondly, we use a machine learning approach based on a Support Vector Machine(SVM) for attack classification. Using MIB and SVM, we achieved fast detection with high accuracy, the minimization of the system burden, and extendibility for system deployment. The proposed mechanism is constructed in a hierarchical structure, which first distinguishes attack traffic from normal traffic and then determines the type of attacks in detail. Using MIB data sets collected from real experiments involving a DDoS attack, we validate the possibility of our approaches. It is shown that network attacks are detected with high efficiency, and classified with low false alarms.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3745/KIPSTC.2008.15-C.5.351", "venue": null, "journal": "The Kips Transactions:partc", "mag_id": "2025196059", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62708970"}

To financial institutions, in most cases, samples of defaults are the minority among total loan samples, while credit client samples making repayments on time are the majority. This phenomenon is called class distribution imbalance problem that is prevailing in credit risk identification. However, existing credit scoring approaches cannot effectively solve the class distribution imbalance problem brought by the scarcity of minority samples. Thus, in this paper, a transfer learning approach is introduced, and the class distribution imbalance problem brought by the scarcity of minority samples is solved through the import of external credit information data. In this paper, a novel transfer learning model is put forward and the classification of target data is facilitated through auxiliary training data transfer so that the efficiency of external credit information using minority samples can be improved. With a new sample initial weight allocation and adjustment strategy, the ability to identify negative samples is highlighted. Through dynamic adjustments to auxiliary training sets, redundant data is duly eliminated as per the pre-set lower weight threshold, reducing the influence of the redundant data on the performance of the classifiers and enhancing the ability of transfer learning to learn imbalanced samples.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-98776-7_8", "venue": "International Conference on Applications and Techniques in Cyber Security and Intelligence ATCI 2018", "journal": "International Conference on Applications and Techniques in Cyber Security and Intelligence ATCI 2018", "mag_id": "2899476917", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["215238431"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:69628880"}

Furthermore, the constraints defining the feasible region within the search space are unknown. The approach proposed in this paper, namely SVM-CBO, is organized in two consecutive phases, the first uses a Support Vector Machine classifier to approximate the boundary of the unknown feasible region, the second uses Bayesian Optimization to find a globally optimal solution within the feasible region. In the first phase the next point to evaluate is chosen by dealing with the trade-off between improving the current estimate of the feasible region and discovering possible disconnected feasible sub-regions. In the second phase, the next point to evaluate is selected as the minimizer of the Lower Confidence Bound acquisition function but constrained to the current estimate of the feasible region. The main of the paper is a comparison with a Bayesian Optimization process which uses a fixed penalty value for infeasible function evaluations, under a limited budget (i.e., maximum number of function evaluations).

Ecological threats to this grassland ecosystem are exacerbated by encroachment of woody plants, with severe negative environmental and economic consequences. Hence, there is an increasing need to reliably determine the extent of encroached or invaded areas to design optimal mitigation measures. Because of inherent limitations that characterise traditional approaches like field surveys and aerial photography, adoption of remotely sensed data offer reliable and timely mapping of landscape processes. Objectives: We sought to map the distribution of woody vegetation within the KZN SS using remote sensing approaches. Method: New generation RapidEye imagery, characterised by strategically positioned bands, and the advanced machine learning algorithm Random Forest (RF) were used to determine the distribution and composition of alien and indigenous woody vegetation within the KZN SS. Results: Results show that alien and indigenous encroachment and invasion could be mapped with over 86% accuracy whilst the dominant indigenous and alien tree species could be mapped with over 74% accuracy. These results highlight the potential of new generation RapidEye satellite data in combination with advanced machine learning technique in predicting the distribution of alien and indigenous woody cover within a grassland ecosystem. The successful discrimination of the two classes and the species within the classes can be attributed to the additional strategically positioned bands, particularly the red-edge in the new generation RapidEye image.

Bed-making can also be difficult for senior citizens and those with limited mobility due to the bending and reaching movements required. Autonomous bed-making combines multiple challenges in robotics: perception in unstructured environments, deformable object manipulation, transfer learning, and sequential decision making. We formalize the bed-making problem as one of maximizing surface coverage with a blanket, and explore algorithmic approaches that use deep learning on depth images to be invariant to the color and pattern of the blankets. We train two networks: one to identify a corner of the blanket and another to determine when to transition to the other side of the bed. Using the first network, the robot grasps at its estimate of the blanket corner and then pulls it to the appropriate corner of the bed frame. The second network estimates if the robot has sufficiently covered one side and can transition to the other, or if it should attempt another grasp from the same side. We evaluate with two robots, the Toyota HSR and the Fetch, and three blankets. Using 2018 and 654 depth images for training the grasp and transition networks respectively, experiments with a quarter-scale twin bed achieve an average of 91.7% blanket coverage, nearly matching human supervisors with 95.0% coverage.

With the development of the advanced tools, these methods are replaced by efficient forecasting techniques. In this paper, a WEKA time series forecasting is being done for the electric power demand for the three seasons such as summer, winter and rainy seasons.

The Support Vector Machine algorithm exhibits low Mean Absolute Error and high Direction Accuracy than other WEKA learning algorithms.

In the second phase, the Genetic algorithm hybrid with Binary Whale Optimization algorithm (GBWOA) is adapted to determine the significance and the optimized features in feature selection phase. The min\u2013max method is used in the third phase to transform all features to binary form in order to increases the efficiency of the proposed model by smoothing the data points and reducing fluctuation among features.

Wetlands are important and valuable ecosystems, yet, since 1900, more than 50 % of wetlands have been lost worldwide. An example of altered and partially restored coastal wetlands is the Danube Delta in Romania. Over time, human intervention has manifested itself in more than a quarter of the entire Danube surface. This intervention was brutal and has rendered ecosystem restoration very difficult. Studies for the rehabilitation / re-vegetation were started immediately after the Danube Delta was declared as a Biosphere Reservation in 1990. Remote sensing offers accurate methods for detecting and mapping change in restored wetlands. Vegetation change detection is a powerful indicator of restoration success. The restoration projects use vegetative cover as an important indicator of restoration success. To follow the evolution of the vegetation cover of the restored areas, satellite images radar and optical of last generation have been used, such as Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. Indeed the sensor sensitivity to the landscape depends on the wavelength what- ever radar or optical data and their polarization for radar data. Combining this kind of data is particularly relevant for the classification of wetland vegetation, which are associated with the density and size of the vegetation. In addition, the high temporal acquisition frequency of Sentinel-1 which are not sensitive to cloud cover al- low to use temporal signature of the different land cover. Thus we analyse the polarimetric and temporal signature of Sentinel-1 data in order to better understand the signature of the different study classes.

However, standard metric learning techniques do not incorporate the class interaction information in learning the transformation matrix, which is often considered to be a bottleneck while dealing with fine-grained visual categories. As a remedy, we propose to organize the classes in a hierarchical fashion by exploring their visual similarities and subsequently learn separate distance metric transformations for the classes present at the nonleaf nodes of the tree.

Linguistic rule extraction has been attracting much attention in explaining knowledge hidden in data. In this paper, we show that the decisions from an SVM classifier can be decoded into linguistic rules based on the information provided by support vectors and decision function. Given a support vector of a certain class, cross points between each line, which is extended from the support vector along each axis, and SVM decision hyper-curve are searched first. A hyperrectangular rule is derived from these cross points. The hyper-rectangle is tuned by a tuning phase in order to exclude those out-class data points. Finally, redundant rules are merged to produce a compact rule set. Simultaneously, important attributes could be highlighted in the extracted rules. Rule extraction results from our proposed method could follow SVM classifier decisions very well. We compare the rule extraction results from SVM with RBF kernel function and linear kernel function. Experiment results show that rules extracted from SVM with RBF nonlinear kernel function are with better accuracy than rules extracted from SVM with linear kernel function.

We propose a novel approach to detect anomalous sensor placement in a semi-real-time manner at the edge of the Internet.

Urban heat island, daily direct solar radiation time, wind speed and wind direction play trivial role in impacting tropospheric ozone. NO 2 is the primary influential factors both for hourly ozone and daily O 3 -8 h due to the titration effect. The most environmental-friendly way to mitigate the ozone pollution is to lower the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with the highest ozone formation potentials.

This study investigated the possibility of using vegetation indices (VIs) derived from Sentinel-2 images and machine learning techniques to assess corn (Zea mays) grain yield spatial variability within the field scale. A 22-ha study field in North Italy was monitored between 2016 and 2018; corn yield was measured and recorded by a grain yield monitor mounted on the harvester machine recording more than 20,000 georeferenced yield observation points from the study field for each season. VIs from a total of 34 Sentinel-2 images at different crop ages were analyzed for correlation with the measured yield observations. Multiple regression and two different machine learning approaches were also tested to model corn grain yield. The three main results were the following: (i) the Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) provided the highest R2 value of 0.48 for monitoring within-field variability of corn grain yield; (ii) the most suitable period for corn yield monitoring was a crop age between 105 and 135 days from the planting date (R4\u2013R6); (iii) Random Forests was the most accurate machine learning approach for predicting within-field variability of corn yield, with an R2 value of almost 0.6 over an independent validation set of half of the total observations. Based on the results, within-field variability of corn yield for previous seasons could be investigated from archived Sentinel-2 data with GNDVI at crop stage (R4\u2013R6).", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3390/rs11232873", "venue": "Remote Sensing", "journal": "Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2993028524", "mag_field_of_study": ["Geology", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["110526024", "55361165", "134672579", "127279286", "6569763", "131743826", "140733147", "85167842", "14743064", "129873753", "52929120", "7053281", "6647390", "10371311", "2452766", "102699583", "128433069", "129713219", "55970669", "128395892", "8104739", "135395654", "84604337", "84338871", "128619277", "129830460", "7594444", "7062181", "3207189", "8062747", "4588626", "3897460", "52919708", "40629878", "16778", "90119029", "45488581", "128541817", "58013580", "57231127", "1061919", "52010796", "18943244", "3342697", "109796082", "215259892", "129494315", "20806060", "55084319", "132148269", "17709246", "202920845", "89141", "6843686", "81489277", "90838899", "55541951"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:210702714"}

In order to help teachers easily analyze students' profiles in intelligent tutoring system, it is essential that students' portfolios can be transformed into some useful information to reflect the extent of students' participation in the curriculum activity. It is observed that students' portfolios seldom reflect students' actual studying behaviors in the learning diagnosis systems given in the literature; we thus propose three kinds of learning parameter improvement mechanisms in this research to establish effective parameters that are frequently used in the learning platforms. The proposed learning parameter improvement mechanisms can calculate the students' effective online learning time, extract the portion of a message in discussion section which is strongly related to the learning topics, and detect plagiarism in students' homework, respectively. The derived numeric parameters are then fed into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict each learner's performance in order to verify whether they mirror the student's studying behaviors. The experimental results show that the prediction rate for the SVM classifier can be increased up to 35.7% in average after the inputs to the classifier are ''purified'' by the learning parameter improvement mechanisms.

Pain being a symptom that can neither be felt nor seen, poses a major problem for the medical personnel involved in pain management since there are no accurate objective measures to establish the extent of pain the patient is suffering from when using a remote assistive medical system. The verbal report grading pain has obvious discrepancies, especially when it comes to children or people with limited ability to communicate (i.e. the mute, mentally impaired, or patients having assisted breathing). When designing a medical assistive system measuring pain in an efficient way is of great importance. In this paper we proposes an algorithm for both automatic pain recognition (i.e. pain/no pain presence in human) and continuous pain intensity estimation based on facial expression analysis. To locate specific landmarks in the face we used Supervised Descent Method (SDM) and then extract feature vectors using Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT). For the recognition task we build a classier based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and for the continuous pain intensity estimation task we trained linear regressor. The experiments with patients with shoulder pain show very good recognition rate (more than 95.7%). For the pain intensity estimation we reached an average Mean Squared Error of 1.28 and Correlation coefficient of 0.59.

The recent development of High-Definition (HD) endoscopy has enabled the specialist physician to identify cancer at an early stage. Nevertheless, it still requires considerable effort and training to be able to recognize these irregularities associated with early cancer. As a first step towards a Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) system that supports the physician in finding these early stages of cancer, we propose an algorithm that is able to identify irregularities in the esophagus automatically, based on HD endoscopic images. The concept employs tile-based processing, so our system is not only able to identify that an endoscopic image contains early cancer, but it can also locate it. The identification is based on the following steps: (1) preprocessing, (2) feature extraction with dimensionality reduction, (3) classification. We evaluate the detection performance in RGB, HSI and YCbCr color space using the Color Histogram (CH) and Gabor features and we compare with other well-known features to describe texture. For classification, we employ a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and evaluate its performance using different parameters and kernel functions. In experiments, our system achieves a classification accuracy of 95.9% on 50\u00d750 pixel tiles of tumorous and normal tissue and reaches an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.990. In 22 clinical examples our algorithm was able to identify all (pre-)cancerous regions and annotate those regions reasonably well.

This issue has motivated the development of methods that explore the global structure of the embedding and other methods that explore hard negative/positive mining. The effectiveness of such mining methods is often associated with intractable computational requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel deep metric learning method that combines the triplet model and the global structure of the embedding space. We rely on a smart mining procedure that produces effective training samples for a low computational cost. In addition, we propose an adaptive controller that automatically adjusts the smart mining hyper-parameters and speeds up the convergence of the training process.

Previously, this problem has been addressed by detecting such instances and using them for appropriate classifier adaptation. The fundamental aspect of a novel-class detection strategy relies on the ability of comparison among observed instances to discriminate them into known and unknown classes. Therefore, studies in the past have proposed various metrics suitable for comparison over the observed feature space. Unfortunately, these similarity measures fail to reliably identify distinct regions in observed feature spaces useful for class discrimination and novel-class detection, especially in streams containing high-dimensional data instances such as images and texts. In this paper, we address this key challenge by proposing a semi-supervised multi-task learning framework called \\sysname{} which aims to intrinsically search for a latent space suitable for detecting labels of instances from both known and unknown classes. We empirically measure the performance of \\sysname{} over multiple real-world image and text datasets and demonstrate its superiority by comparing its performance with existing semi-supervised methods.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": "1811.05141", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2900503687", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14240373", "3332134", "28671436", "8281592", "3193641", "8171306", "206771194", "206594692", "13046179", "7200347", "3217198", "4704285", "18268744", "14542261", "40139693", "3526391", "7553359", "425268", "27208325", "16852518", "206592585", "5726681", "206592766", "3641676", "10987393", "207566367", "47325215", "702279", "2643381"], "inbound_citations": ["215548799"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53292748"}

Experimental recognition techniques for DNA-binding proteins identification are both time consuming and expensive. Effective methods for identifying these proteins only based on protein sequences are highly required. The key for sequence-based methods is to effectively represent protein sequences. It has been reported by various previous studies that evolutionary information is crucial for DNA-binding protein identification. In this study, we employed four methods to extract the evolutionary information from Position Specific Frequency Matrix (PSFM), including Residue Probing Transformation (RPT), Evolutionary Difference Transformation (EDT), Distance-Bigram Transformation (DBT), and Trigram Transformation (TT). The PSFMs were converted into fixed length feature vectors by these four methods, and then respectively combined with Support Vector Machines (SVMs); four predictors for identifying these proteins were constructed, including PSFM-RPT, PSFM-EDT, PSFM-DBT, and PSFM-TT. Experimental results on a widely used benchmark dataset PDB1075 and an independent dataset PDB186 showed that these four methods achieved state-of-the-art-performance, and PSFM-DBT outperformed other existing methods in this field.

Most existing social recommenders are based on matrix factorization, a collaborative filtering model that has been proven to be effective. In this paper, we introduce a novel social recommender based on the idea that distance reflects likability. Compared with matrix factorization, the proposed model enables us to obtain a spatial understanding of the latent factor space and how users and items are positioned inside the space by combining the factorization model and distance metric learning. In our method, users and items are initially mapped into a unified low-dimensional space. The positions of users and items are jointly determined by ratings and social relations, which can help to determine appropriate locations for users who have few ratings. Finally, the learned metrics and positions are used to generate understandable and reliable recommendations. Experiments conducted on real-world data sets have shown that compared with methods based on only matrix factorization, our method significantly improves the recommendation accuracy.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2762459", "venue": "IEEE Access", "journal": "IEEE Access", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2762723868", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14321399", "142501219", "207165499", "15526356", "14899273", "61361328", "7176266", "11129957", "33852837", "8616518", "47325215", "55485900", "18058643", "402803", "41206123", "3022077", "850937", "8699669", "28244700", "10134126", "13388735", "6123087", "5959482", "1210515", "8506049", "25146899", "8702168", "467086", "1909293", "7478193", "479334", "7848601", "5813451", "206766192", "14287301", "3459387"], "inbound_citations": ["52300251", "203655584", "203167460", "52228661", "59554752", "202538667", "52898204", "51922639", "88495330", "56171523"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:19074644"}

Since different substances exhibit different spectral signatures, hyperspectral imagery is a well-suited technology for accurate image classification, which is an important task in many application domains. However, the high dimensionality of the data presents challenges for image analysis. While most of the previously proposed classification techniques process each pixel independently without considering information about spatial structures, recent research in image processing has highlighted the importance of the incorporation of spatial context in a classifier. In this thesis, we propose and develop novel spectral-spatial methods and algorithms for accurate classification of hyperspectral data. First, the integration of the Support Vector Machines (SVM) technique within a Markov Random Fields (MRFs) framework for context classification is investigated. SVM and MRF models are two powerful tools for high-dimensional data classification and for contextual image analysis, respectively. In a second step, we propose classification methods using adaptive spatial neighborhoods derived from region segmentation results. Different segmentation techniques are investigated and extended to the case of hyperspectral images. Then, approaches for combining the extracted spatial regions with spectral information in a classifier are developed. In a third step, we concentrate on approaches to reduce oversegmentation in an image, which is achieved by automatically \u201cmarking\u201d the spatial structures of interest before performing a marker-controlled segmentation. Our proposal is to analyze probabilistic classification results for selecting the most reliably classified pixels as markers of spatial regions. Several marker selection methods are proposed, using either individual classifiers, or a multiple classifier system. Then, different approaches for marker-controlled region growing are developed, using either watershed or Minimum Spanning Forest methods and resulting in both segmentation and context classification maps. Finally, we explore possibilities of high-performance parallel computing on commodity processors for reducing computational loads.

The objective of this study is to improve the recognition rates by combining different representations of non-normalized handwritten digits. These features include some global statistics, moments, profile and projection based features and features computed from the contour and skeleton of the digits. Some of these features are extracted from the complete image of digit while others are extracted from different regions of the image by first applying a uniform grid sampling to the image. Classification is carried out using one-against-all SVM. The experiments conducted on the CVL Single Digit Database realized high recognition rates which are comparable to state-of-the-art methods on this subject. Keywords\u2014Isolated handwritten digits; feature combination, Support Vector Machine. I. I NTRODUCTION Handwriting recognition has been the premier research problem of the document analysis and recognition community for over three decades now. The sub problems in handwriting recognition mainly include line, word or character level segmentation, recognition of isolated characters, words, or complete lines/paragraphs and recognition of numerical strings and isolated digits. Among these different modalities of handwriting recognition, this research focuses on recognition of isolated digits, a classical pattern recognition problem that offers a wide range of applications. Unlike alphabet, the ten glyphs of the most commonly used Western Arabic numerals are shared by many scripts and languages around the world making them globally acceptable. The main challenges in handwritten digit recognition arise from variations in size, shape, slant, and most importantly, the differences in the writing styles of individuals. With the recent advancements in image analysis and pattern classification, sophisticated digit recognition systems have been proposed which aim to enhance the overall recognition performance by improving the feature extraction or/and classification techniques used. Some of the studies aim to improve the classification performance by using a combination of multiple classifiers while others aim to combine multiple features and select the most pertinent and optimum set of features for this problem. In this paper, we are interested in enhancing the feature extraction step for isolated digit recognition used for avoiding digit normalization. The idea is to find a combination of multiple features which improves the overall recognition rates by minimizing the intra-class variability and maximizing inter-class variability [4, 13, 23], the most desirable requirement of any pattern recognition system. Over the years, various handwritten isolated digit recognition systems reporting high recognition rates have been proposed. Most of these systems have been evaluated on the widely used MNIST database. Recently, the handwritten digit recognition competition [19] held in conjunction with ICDAR 2013 also provided a platform for comparison of state-of-the-art digit recognition techniques under the same experimental conditions. Among significant contributions to digit recognition, authors in [31] present a comprehensive comparison of different classification algorithms on the recognition task. Heutte et al. [15] proposed a combination of seven different features to feed a linear discrimination based classifier. Dong et al. [12] extracted a set of gradient features while Teow and Loe [16] computed linearly separable features from the MNIST database and applied triowise linear support vector machine with soft voting for classification. Belongie et al. [27] developed a novel similarity measure by finding the correspondences between points in two shapes and estimating an aligning transform. The proposed matching technique achieved high recognition rates when applied to digit recognition. In another notable contribution, Lauer et al. [7] proposed a trainable feature extractor based on LeNet5 neural network architecture.

Toward this end, deep learning classifiers have recently been used for identifying ASD from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with higher accuracy than traditional learning strategies. However, a key challenge with deep learning models is understanding just what image features the network is using, which can in turn be used to define the biomarkers. Current methods extract biomarkers, i.e., important features, by looking at how the prediction changes if \u201cignoring\u201d one feature at a time. However, this can lead to serious errors if the features are conditionally dependent. In this work, we go beyond looking at only individual features by using Shapley value explanation (SVE) from cooperative game theory. Cooperative game theory is advantageous here because it directly considers the interaction between features and can be applied to any machine learning method, making it a novel, more accurate way of determining instance-wise biomarker importance from deep learning models. A barrier to using SVE is its computational complexity: \\(2^N\\) given N features. We explicitly reduce the complexity of SVE computation by two approaches based on the underlying graph structure of the input data: (1) only consider the centralized coalition of each feature; (2) a hierarchical pipeline which first clusters features into small communities, then applies SVE in each community. Monte Carlo approximation can be used for large permutation sets. We first validate our methods on the MNIST dataset and compare to human perception. Next, to insure plausibility of our biomarker results, we train a Random Forest (RF) to classify ASD/control subjects from fMRI and compare SVE results to standard RF-based feature importance.

Connectionism is founded upon a neural metaphor in that connectionist networks are made up of many simple, neuron-like units.

It is widely held that damaging connectionist networks informs our understanding of neuropsychology and cognitive psychology. To what extent then does it currently tell us, or is likely to tell us, anything about behavioral change following brain damage? Current connectionist models simulate either spontaneous recovery or the effects of retraining, and I discuss both approaches. Which is taken at present partly depends upon the connectionist framework used as the starting point. Most simulation work involving back-propagation has focused upon retraining lesioned networks, while work involving interactive activation has focused upon making inferences about the time course of spontaneous recovery.

Recently, several HDP methods have been proposed. However, these methods do not sufficiently incorporate the two characteristics of the defect prediction data: (1) data could be linearly inseparable, and (2) data could be highly imbalanced. These two data characteristics make it challenging to build an effective HDP model. In this paper, we propose a novel Ensemble Multiple Kernel Correlation Alignment (EMKCA) based approach to HDP, which takes into consideration the two characteristics of the defect prediction data. Specifically, we first map the source and target project data into high dimensional kernel space through multiple kernel leaning, where the defective and non-defective modules can be better separated. Then, we design a kernel correlation alignment method to make the data distribution of the source and target projects similar in the kernel space. Finally, we integrate multiple kernel classifiers with ensemble learning to relieve the influence caused by class imbalance problem, which can improve the accuracy of the defect prediction model. Consequently, EMKCA owns the advantages of both multiple kernel learning and ensemble learning.

In practice, however, often only incomplete or uncertain information about the quantities of interest is available. The question studied in the present thesis is, how a regression analysis can reasonably be performed when the variables are only imprecisely observed. ::: At first, different approaches to analyzing imprecisely observed variables that were proposed in the Statistics literature are discussed. Then, a new likelihood-based methodology for regression analysis with imprecise data called Likelihood-based Imprecise Regression is introduced. The corresponding methodological framework is very broad and permits accounting for coarsening errors, in contrast to most alternative approaches to analyzing imprecise data. The methodology suggests considering as the result of a regression analysis the entire set of all regression functions that cannot be excluded in the light of the data, which can be interpreted as a confidence set. In the subsequent chapter, a very general regression method is derived from the likelihood-based methodology. This regression method does not impose restrictive assumptions about the form of the imprecise observations, about the underlying probability distribution, and about the shape of the relationship between the variables. Moreover, an exact algorithm is developed for the special case of simple linear regression with interval data and selected statistical properties of this regression method are studied. The proposed regression method turns out to be robust in terms of a high breakdown point and to provide very reliable insights in the sense of a set-valued result with a high coverage probability. In addition, an alternative approach proposed in the literature based on Support Vector Regression is studied in detail and generalized by embedding it into the framework of the formerly introduced likelihood-based methodology.

Typhimurium. In the last decade, its prevalence rose sharply. Although S. 4,[5],12:i:- and S. Typhimurium are known to pose a considerable public health risk, there is no detailed information on the circulation of these serovars in Italy, particularly as far as veterinary isolates are concerned. For this reason, a data set of 877 strains isolated in the north-east of Italy from foodstuffs, animals and environment was analysed during 2005\u20132010. The Random Forests (RF) method was used to identify the most important epidemiological and phenotypic variables to show the difference between the two serovars. Both descriptive analysis and RF revealed that S. 4,[5],12:i:- is less heterogeneous than S. Typhimurium. RF highlighted that phage type was the most important variable to differentiate the two serovars. The most common phage types identified for S. 4,[5],12:i:- were DT20a, U311 and DT193. The same phage types were also found in S. Typhimurium isolates, although with a much lower prevalence. DT7 and DT120 were ascribed to the two serovars at comparable levels. DT104, DT2 and DT99 were ascribed exclusively to S. Typhimurium, and almost all the other phage types identified were more related to the latter serovar. Such data confirm that phage typing can provide an indication of the biphasic or monophasic state of the strains investigated and could therefore support serotyping results. However, phage typing cannot be used as the definitive method to differentiate the two serovars, as part of the phage types were detected for both serovars and, in particular, all phage types found for S. 4,[5],12:i- were found also for S.

After preparing data set and R program for data mining, performance evaluation was made with classification algorithms (J48, Random Forest, Naive Bayes). The 'accuracy' criterion was taken into consideration when interpreting the results.Results \u2013 At the end of the study, the accuracy rates were determined for three data sets. Looking at the \"wine\" data, the performance of all three algorithms is quite successful. The results of the other two data sets (lenses and liver) are parallel. Only the \u2018liver\u2019 dataset gave a slightly lower accuracy than expected with the Naive Bayes algorithm (0.55).Conclusion \u2013 In this study, performance comparison of algorithms has been made within the scope of data mining with R program. The accuracy rate was taken as a criterion. All codes are given with their outputs in order to be an example especially for young researchers or students. It is thought that this study can be a source for other researchers, will encourage the use of R and the researchers or students will try new papers by trying the codes.Recommendations \u2013 In subsequent studies, a similar study can be done by developing the given codes.

This research concentrates on proposing an autonomous approach for on-line incremental learning from observation of failure states. Existing research on handling external failures typically offers special-purpose solutions depending on what has been foreseen at the design time. Furthermore, the current incremental online learning algorithms are not capable of extracting an appropriate set of hypotheses with just a few observations. These extracted set of hypotheses can be then used for classification. The proposed argumentation-based on-line incremental learning approach uses the abstract and bipolar argumentation framework to extract the most relevant hypotheses and model the defeasibility relation between them. This leads to a novel on-line incremental learning approach which overcomes the addressed problems.

For this multicentric trial, participants were enrolled from four different centers. CSF was collected according to standardized protocols. For bioelement determination, CSF samples were subjected to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. A predefined Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, trained on a previous discovery cohort was applied for differentiation, based on the levels of six different bioelements. 82 PD patients, 68 age-matched controls and 7 additional Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) patients were included to validate a predefined SVM model. Six differentiating elements (As, Fe, Mg, Ni, Se, Sr) were quantified. Based on their levels, SVM was successfully applied to a new local cohort (AUROC 0.76, Sensitivity 0.80, Specificity 0.83), without taking any additional features into account. The same model did not discriminate PD and AMCs / NPH from three external cohorts, likely due to center effects. However, discrimination was possible in cohorts with a full elemental data set, now using center-specific discovery cohorts and a cross validated approach (AUROC 0.78 and 0.88, respectively). Pooled PD CSF iron levels showed a clear correlation with disease duration (p = .0001). In summary, bioelemental CSF patterns, obtained by mass spectrometry and integrated into a predictive model yield the potential to facilitate the differentiation of PD and AMC.

In this work, a non-invasive technique that monitors the eye state is used to detect the drowsiness of the driver. A novel feature called minimum intensity projection is proposed to detect the eye state of the driver and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to classify the eye state as open or closed. After detecting the eye status, drowsiness level is measured by calculating the duration of eye closeness and if the eyes are found to be closed over some consecutive frames then it is concluded that the person is falling asleep or having a state of drowsiness and hence an alarm is raised.

This is especially true when users can easily express themselves with their likes and dislikes for certain items. In this paper, we explore how to use the binary preference data expressed in the form of like/dislike to help reduce the impact of data sparsity of more expressive numerical ratings. We do this by transferring the rating knowledge from some auxiliary data source in binary form (that is, likes or dislikes), to a target numerical rating matrix. Our solution is to model both numerical ratings and like/dislike in a principled way, using a novel framework of Transfer by Collective Factorization (TCF). In particular, we construct the shared latent space collectively and learn the data-dependent effect separately. A major advantage of the TCF approach over previous collective matrix factorization (or bifactorization) methods is that we are able to capture the data-dependent effect when sharing the data-independent knowledge, so as to increase the over-all quality of knowledge transfer. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TCF at various sparsity levels as compared to several state-of-the-art methods.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5591/978-1-57735-516-8/IJCAI11-386", "venue": "IJCAI", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "193545200", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["57132230", "206784101", "717520"], "inbound_citations": ["20590565", "35888351", "15163104", "43741769", "201670731", "32993784", "6701960", "15375461", "16105057", "35412312", "197671749", "215153665", "10549146", "52084596", "7491969", "5493334", "53428137", "16657839", "17201468", "9253851", "14154223", "17330121", "15230959", "18490933", "211242881", "28491187", "9497194", "11235664", "47020773", "52086153", "23076475", "52889265", "16490414", "207759174", "58981833", "62912059", "57241112", "199509949", "21020014", "6615440", "16464000", "2652645", "16346185", "3761015", "209852978", "53222057", "204835910", "4724400", "4597204", "15667045", "3623848", "24902381", "3192264", "15071420", "17756840", "10753797", "17458323", "17843315", "52107971", "5013313", "52910924", "15617068", "3911114", "12308197", "309446", "58948389", "9192007"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:11670500"}

We have also set up a CRFs prediction web server, which includes all the optimised parameters obtained from training process. Furthermore, we have carried out detailed experiments comparing CRFs against Maximum Entropy Markov Models (MEMMs), and have shown that CRFs are significantly better than MEMMs in predicting the location of helix segments in transmembrane proteins.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2182044967", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204017498"}

To date, most of the studies concentrated on the so-called whole-spectrum approach, which treats each point in the spectrum as a separate test, due to its better accuracy than the profiling approach. However, the whole-spectrum approach does not guarantee biologically meaningful results and is difficult for biological interpretation and clinical application. Therefore, to develop an accurate profiling technique for early detection of ovarian cancer is required. This paper proposes a novel profiling method for high-resolution ovarian cancer MS data by integrating the Smoothed Nonlinear Energy Operator (SNEO), correlation-based peak selection and Random Forest classifier. In order to evaluate the performance of this novel method without bias, we employed randomization techniques by dividing the data set into testing set and training set to test the whole procedure for many times over.

The field was introduced in the late-1980s, but only in the latest years the field has become mature enough to enable the optimization of deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks. In this paper, we rely on previous work to apply neuroevolution in order to optimize the topology of deep neural networks that can be used to solve the problem of handwritten character recognition. Moreover, we take advantage of the fact that evolutionary algorithms optimize a population of candidate solutions, by combining a set of the best evolved models resulting in a committee of convolutional neural networks. This process is enhanced by using specific mechanisms to preserve the diversity of the population. Additionally, in this paper, we address one of the disadvantages of neuroevolution: the process is very expensive in terms of computational time. To lessen this issue, we explore the performance of topology transfer learning: whether the best topology obtained using neuroevolution for a certain domain can be successfully applied to a different domain. By doing so, the expensive process of neuroevolution can be reused to tackle different problems, turning it into a more appealing approach for optimizing the design of neural networks topologies. After evaluating our proposal, results show that both the use of neuroevolved committees and the application of topology transfer learning are successful: committees of convolutional neural networks are able to improve classification results when compared to single models, and topologies learned for one problem can be reused for a different problem and data with a good performance. Additionally, both approaches can be combined by building committees of transferred topologies, and this combination attains results that combine the best of both approaches.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1155/2019/2952304", "venue": "Complexity", "journal": "Complexity", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2923002339", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["206594692", "56507745", "46873548", "14542261", "6916627", "3183121", "1799558", "6287870", "59597264", "16475533", "12346405", "207232413", "26843841", "17098047", "1117341", "206770867", "1344676", "6774439", "743641", "9633006", "12138305", "51608007", "3493612", "23873820", "3718676", "49339234", "4151628", "133025084", "53105265", "10122297", "52160623", "119195518", "13827620", "17561511", "1740355", "740063", "7776851", "12507257", "59785963", "15983716", "11312275", "21182371", "44845547", "3632108", "15967918", "16482179", "15445883", "3054286", "595635", "7452247"], "inbound_citations": ["211003892"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:85559575"}

The current work extends the relevance of connectionist modeling in neuropsychology to address issues in cognitive rehabilitation: the degree and speed of recovery through retraining, the extent to which improvement on treated items generalizes to untreated items, and how treated items are selected to maximize this generalization. A network previously used to model impairments in mapping orthography to semantics is retrained after damage. The degree of relearning and generalization varies considerably for different lesion locations, and has interesting implications for understanding the nature and variability of recovery in patients. In a second simulation, retraining on words whose semantics are atypical of their category yields more generalization than retraining on more typical words, suggesting a counterintuitive strategy for selecting items in patient therapy to maximize recovery. In a final simulation, changes in the pattern of errors produced by the network over the course of recovery is used to constrain explanations of the nature of recovery of analogous brain-damaged patients.

Despite this, many systems are built with standard, predefined filter banks that are not optimized for that particular application. Representation learning methods such as restricted Boltzmann machines may outperform these standard filter banks because they learn a feature description directly from the training data. Like many other representation learning methods, restricted Boltzmann machines are unsupervised and are trained with a generative learning objective; this allows them to learn representations from unlabeled data, but does not necessarily produce features that are optimal for classification. In this paper we propose the convolutional classification restricted Boltzmann machine, which combines a generative and a discriminative learning objective. This allows it to learn filters that are good both for describing the training data and for classification. We present experiments with feature learning for lung texture classification and airway detection in CT images. In both applications, a combination of learning objectives outperformed purely discriminative or generative learning, increasing, for instance, the lung tissue classification accuracy by 1 to 8 percentage points.

However, some useful structural information of network, especially global topological information, may be lost in this type of approaches. To address this issue, in this article, we propose a connectivity-networks-based classification framework to identify accurately the MCI patients from NC. The core of the proposed method involves the use of a new graph-kernel-based approach to measure directly the topological similarity between connectivity networks. We evaluate our method on functional connectivity networks of 12 MCI and 25 NC subjects. The experimental results show that our proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 91.9%, a sensitivity of 100.0%, a balanced accuracy of 94.0%, and an area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.94, demonstrating a great potential in MCI classification, based on connectivity networks.

In this paper, a cost-efficient online adaptive learning approach is proposed for SVR by combining Feature Vector Selection (FVS) and Incremental and Decremental Learning. The proposed approach adaptively modifies the model only when different pattern drifts are detected according to proposed criteria. Two tolerance parameters are introduced in the approach to control the computational complexity, reduce the influence of the intrinsic noise in the data and avoid the overfitting problem of SVR. Comparisons of the prediction results is made with other online learning approaches e.g. NORMA, SOGA, KRLS, Incremental Learning, on several artificial datasets and a real case study concerning time series prediction based on data recorded on a component of a nuclear power generation system.

The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm have been successfully hybridized with the support vector regression (SVR) to produce satisfactory forecasting performance in previous studies. Decomposed intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), could be further defined as three items: item A contains the random term and the middle term; item B contains the middle term and the trend (residual) term, and item C contains the middle terms only, where the random term represents the high-frequency part of the electric load data, the middle term represents the multiple-frequency part, and the trend term represents the low-frequency part.

Combinations of the three binary perspectives give eight sets of sequences from the (training) set of transactions. Each one of these sets is modelled with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM).

In traditional spectral unmixing methods that are based on the linear spectral mixture model (LSMM), unmixing accuracy is limited by the inherent deficiency of the model. It was shown that the support vector machine (SVM) can be extended for spectral unmixing, based on the advantage that the SVM model can accommodate the variations within a relative pure class by using multiple pure samples instead of a single endmember for one class. In the SVM model, class label errors are considered in constraints. However, the errors concerned in spectral unmixing are the unmixing residue instead of the class label ones.

However, the characteristics of SDSN bring several important issues to be solved in the routing scheme. First, interface protocols of the controller incur nonnegligible overhead, which affects the general traffic. Second, more than one controller is required to ensure the reliability of SDSN, which means that they should cooperate with each other to realize the routing function. Third, how to make full use of the advantage of SDSN\u2019s centralized management for routing algorithm is worth studying. In this paper, we first propose an SDSN architecture to realize flexible centralized management. Based on this architecture, Intelligent Quality of Service (QoS) Routing scheme is proposed and evaluated. Intelligent QoS Routing (IQR) scheme is composed of overhead balancing strategy, controller cooperation strategy, and IQR algorithm. Overhead balancing strategy effectively reduces the impact of overhead on general traffic, which improves the performance of IQR algorithm. Controller cooperation strategy adopts the ensemble Support Vector Regression (SVR) from artificial intelligence tools to enhance the consistency of different controllers\u2019 network views under low frequency situation, which will provide a more accurate reference for IQR algorithm and other management strategies. IQR algorithm takes full advantage of SDSN\u2019s centralized control and rich data to offer fine-grained QoS guarantee intelligently.

Specifically, we resolve two common questions: how to estimate the community-based causal effect of community-level stochastic interventions, and how to take advantage of data-adaptive ensemble learning to problems of estimation in public health data. Chapter 1 begins by reviewing the targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE). We also provide a more detailed summary to each of the rest of the chapters. Chapter 2 studies the framework for target maximum likelihood estimation and statistical inference for the causal effects of community-level treatments on individual-level outcomes where the outcomes could be correlated because of the interactions among individuals from the same communities and the shared community-level covariates. This chapter presents a new solution that considers the case in which the treatment mechanism may cause stochastically assigned exposures and the corresponding causal parameter may require a more easily achievable positivity assumption. Given two different structural equation models, we develop two semi-parametric efficient TMLEs for the estimation of such a community-based causal effect. The proposed TMLEs have several crucial advantages. First, both TMLEs can make use of individual level data in the hierarchical setting, and potentially reduce finite sample bias and improve estimator efficiency. Second, the stochastic intervention framework provides a natural way for defining and estimating casual effects where the exposure variables are continuous or discrete with multiple levels, or even cannot be directly intervened on. Also, the positivity assumption needed for our proposed causal parameters can be weaker than the version of positivity required for other casual parameters. Chapter 3 builds on the work described in Chapter 2 and presents an open-source software tool for implementing TMLE of the average causal effect of community-level intervention(s) at a single time point. This software supports a wide variety of TMLE implementations. For example, the package supports univariate or multivariate arbitrary (i.e., static, dynamic or stochastic) interventions with a binary or continuous outcome. It also allows users to use either weighted intercept-based TMLE or unweighted covariate-based TMLE. In Chapter 4, we propose a new ensemble approach to gain a better understanding of the natural history of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Super Learner (SL) is an ensemble method that uses V-folds cross-validation to build the optimal weighted combination of the predicted values from a library of user-specified prediction algorithms. Because data-adaptive methods are allowed in a SL library, SL can be used to avoid unrealistic parametric assumptions without overfitting the data in practice. This proposed AUC-maximizing ensemble approach couples each prediction model with a comprehensive feature selection algorithm, including Bayesian risk ratio method, column sparsity based regularization, and L1 regularization.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2977138387", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204075659"}

We developed a method that leverages TLS collections with machine learning techniques to model and map canopy cover and biomass of several classes of short-stature vegetation across large plots. We collected high-definition TLS scans of 26 1-ha plots in desert grasslands and big sagebrush shrublands in southwest Idaho, USA. We used the Random Forests machine learning algorithm to develop decision tree models predicting the biomass and canopy cover of several vegetation classes from statistical descriptors of the aboveground heights of TLS points. Manual measurements of vegetation characteristics collected within each plot served as training and validation data. Models based on five or fewer TLS descriptors of vegetation heights were developed to predict the canopy cover fraction of shrubs (R 2 = 0.77, RMSE = 7%), annual grasses (R 2 = 0.70, RMSE = 21%), perennial grasses (R 2 = 0.36, RMSE = 12%), forbs (R 2 = 0.52, RMSE = 6%), bare earth or litter (R 2 = 0.49, RMSE = 19%), and the biomass of shrubs (R 2 = 0.71, RMSE = 175 g) and herbaceous vegetation (R 2 = 0.61, RMSE = 99 g) (all values reported are out-of-bag). Our models explained much of the variability between predictions and manual measurements, and yet we expect that future applications could produce even better results by reducing some of the methodological sources of error that we encountered. Our work demonstrates how TLS can be used efficiently to extend manual measurement of vegetation characteristics from small to large plots in grasslands and shrublands, with potential application to other similarly structured ecosystems. Our method shows that vegetation structural characteristics can be modeled without classifying and delineating individual plants, a challenging and time-consuming step common in previous methods applying TLS to vegetation inventory.

Motion tracking is important for smart services and location-based services in smart cities, since it provides natural ways for users to interact with the IoT infrastructures, such as the ability to recognize of a wide range of hand motion in real-time. Compared with dedicated hardware devices, ubiquitous devices with reliable speakers and microphones can be developed to achieve cheap acoustic-based motion tracking, which is appropriate for low-power and low-cost IoT applications. However, for complex urban environments, it is very difficult for acoustic-based methods to achieve accurate motion tracking due to multipath fading and limited sampling rate at mobile devices. In this paper, a new parameter called multipath dispersion vector (MDV) is proposed to estimate and mitigate the impact of multipath fading on received signals using extreme learning machine. Based on MDV, a robust acoustic motion tracking (RAMTEL) method is proposed to calculate the moving distance based on the phase change of acoustic signals, and track the corresponding motion in 2-D plane by using multiple speakers. The method is then proposed and implemented on standard Android smartphones. Experiment results show, without any specialized hardware, RAMTEL can achieve an impressive millimeter-level accuracy for localization and motion tracking applications in multipath fading environments.

{"paper_id": "68141036", "title": "Predicting Bicycle Availability By Means Of Data Mining Algorithms", "authors": [{"first": "Sorath", "middle": [], "last": "Asnani", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "The concerns about global warming, air and noise pollutions, unstable fuel prices and road safety have caused policy makers to examine the need for sustainable means of transport. In the context of better urban mobility systems, the public Bicycle Sharing Systems (BSSs) have seen a great development in recent years. Community shared bicycle programs are being promoted all over the world as a \u201cgreen\u201d transportation system.A BSS is an innovative transportation service, usually aimed for short-distance trips. The core idea of a BSS is that a user takes a bicycle from station A, uses that bike to travel to another location and returns the bicycle at station B. Community shared bicycling programs offer an environmentally friendly and inexpensive means of inner-city transportation.BSSs have some problems related to limited number of bicycles and limited number of free slots in stations. In some occasions, it is not possible to pick-up bicycle at a certain station because the station might be empty or it might contain broken bikes. It may also happen that a user does not find a parking slot to drop the bicycle at a certain destination station.One possible solution to these problems is to enable the users to know beforehand about the availability of bicycles so that they can go directly to those stations where bikes/parking slots are available. This can be done by predicting the number of bikes at each station at some future point of time. The major research goal of the thesis is to study and compare some models to predict the availability of bikes in Bicing stations some minutes ahead.Data pre-processing was the critical part of this research. Extensive efforts have been put in identifying the dirty data in the available data set and to perform data cleaning in order to ensure the correctness of the data to be trained and tested. After reviewing the literature, we decided to use three models for predicting the number of bikes, the ARMA, the Decision Tree and the Random Forest models. After the implementation of these models, a Baseline model based on the Historic Mean was considered to measure the performance of the three models.After data cleaning, the total number of stations used in this study was 268. The training data set comprises of 800 continuous hours and the testing data set composed of non-overlapping data of 30 hours. All the models were trained using the same data sets.The performance of these models was calculated in terms of the absolute errors. The minimum, the maximum and the mean absolute errors were computed for all the models, including the Historic Mean Baseline model. Six prediction models were generated from each of the four algorithms, one prediction model for each prediction time.The mean absolute errors of all the prediction models were compared with each other to rank the performance of the models. The Random Forest algorithm showed the highest mean absolute errors for all the prediction time periods; hence its performance to predict the number of bikes is worst in our case.On the other hand, an interesting fact was identified between the ARMA and the Historic Mean Baseline model. For the predictions of 10, 20 and 30 minutes ahead, the Baseline model showed the least mean absolute errors, while for higher time instances, such as 40, 50 and 60 minutes ahead, the performance of ARMA model was the best among all. Such results can lead us to the conclusions that the ARMA Model can be the best choice for predictions beyond 30 minutes, while for shorter terms, the Historic Mean can be considered as the best.Hence the research was concluded by considering the ARMA model to be the best among other three models i.e. the Decision Tree, the Random Forest and the Historic Mean Baseline models for predictions from 40 to 60 minutes ahead.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2910685578", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:68141036"}

The traditional GRNN Oracle classifier (Masters et al., 1998) combines the predictive powers of several machine learning classifiers by weighing the amount of error each classifier has on the final predictions. Each classifier is assigned a weight based on the percentage of errors it contributes to the final predictions as the classifiers evaluate the dataset. The proposed R-GRNN Oracle is an enhancement to the GRNN Oracle in which the proposed algorithm consists of an oracle within an oracle \u2013 where the inner oracle acts as a classifier with its own predictions and error contribution. By combining the inner oracle with other classifiers, the R-GRNN Oracle produces superior results. The classifiers considered in this study are: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Random Forest (RF). To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, several datasets were used, with the primary one being the publicly available Spambase dataset. The predictions of SVM, MLP, KNN, and RF were used to create the first GRNN Oracle, which was then enhanced with the high performances of SVM and RF to create the second oracle, the R-GRNN Oracle. The combined recursive model was 93.24% accurate using 10-fold cross validation, higher than the 91.94% of the inner GRNN Oracle and the 91.29% achieved by RF, the highest performance by a stand-alone classifier. The R-GRNN Oracle was not only the most accurate, but it also had the highest AUC, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score (97.99%, 91.86%, 94.40%, 93.28%, and 92.57%, respectively). The research contribution of this paper is introducing the concept of recursion (a concept not fully explored in machine learning models and applications) and testing this structure's ability on further enhancing the performance of the traditional oracle.

However, real world planners can also rely on runtime information to facilitate additional planning during execution. The completable approach to planning introduces the idea of completable steps , which represent deferred planning decisions. Through completable steps, a planner can defer particular goals until execution time, when additional information may be used for their achievement. To maintain the provably correct nature of plans afforded by classical planning, completable steps have the additional requirement of achievability. Unfortunately, without additional higher-order knowledge for reasoning about achievability, proving achievability becomes infeasible for any real world domain. We thus developed an incremental approach for learning completable plans. Using this approach, instead of proving achievability a planner uses feedback from its experience with the real world to construct completable plans which cover an increasing space of situations. This approach to real-world planning has been successfully tested in a simple simulated robot navigation domain.", "year": 1994, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/b978-1-55860-335-6.50018-0", "venue": "ICML", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1602654873", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["12125188", "16695812", "2316338", "578934", "34536024", "14889849", "41925321", "1720555", "15343295", "66733", "2787918", "117264", "14916630", "12995282", "14225969", "3146858", "763785", "35872050", "59858604"], "inbound_citations": ["16285360", "14780550", "14275146"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14189679"}

A total of 7711 spectroscopy voxels were exploited. The first contribution of this paper is to present improvements of the automatic classification results compared with those of Parfait, thanks to an improvement in the quality of spectra. We also improved the global detection by introducing mp-MRI based features in the classification process. We selected the most discriminative features by evaluating several combinations of MRI modalities. Moreover, we have extended the analysis to the entire prostate gland (peripheral zone (PZ) and central gland (CG)). We evaluated the SVM classifier's ability to discriminate healthy and malignant voxels and the proposed method produces a global error rate of 1%, sensitivity of 99.1% and specificity of 98.4%. The three classes, including benign voxels data were then evaluated. An error rate of 18.2%, a sensitivity of 72% and a specificity of 88% were obtained when associating Random Forest classifier, MRSI, Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI and Diffusion-Weighted MRI.

Large computer systems in general, and data centers in particular, will ultimately be managed using predictive computational and executable models obtained through data-science tools, and at that point, the intervention of humans will be limited to setting high-level goals and policies rather than performing low-level operations. Data-driven autonomics, where management and control are based on holistic predictive models that are built and updated using generated data, opens one possible path towards limiting the role of operators in data centers. In this paper, we present a data-science study of a public Google dataset collected in a 12K-node cluster with the goal of building and evaluating a predictive model for node failures. We use BigQuery, the big data SQL platform from the Google Cloud suite, to process massive amounts of data and generate a rich feature set characterizing machine state over time. We describe how an ensemble classifier can be built out of many Random Forest classifiers each trained on these features, to predict if machines will fail in a future 24-hour window. Our evaluation reveals that if we limit false positive rates to 5%, we can achieve true positive rates between 27% and 88% with precision varying between 50% and 72%. We discuss the practicality of including our predictive model as the central component of a data-driven autonomic manager and operating it on-line with live data streams (rather than off-line on data logs).

Aspects of this signal-to-symbol transformation have been intensively studied over many decades, using psychophysical procedures. The perception of (synthetic) syllable-initial stop consonants has been especially well studied, since these sounds display a marked categorization effect: they are typically dichotomised into \u2018voiced\u2019 and \u2018unvoiced\u2019 classes according to their voice onset time (VOT). In this case, the category boundary is found to have a systematic relation to the (simulated) place of articulation, but there is no currently-accepted explanation of this phenomenon. Categorization effects have now been demonstrated in a variety of animal species as well as humans, indicating that their origins lie in general auditory and/or learning mechanisms, rather than in some \u2018phonetic module\u2019 specialized to human speech processing. ::: ::: In recent work, we have demonstrated that appropriately-trained computational learning systems (\u2018neural networks\u2019) also display the same systematic behaviour as human and animal listeners. Networks are trained on simulated patterns of auditory-nerve firings in response to synthetic \u2018continuua\u2019 of stop-consonant/vowel syllables varying in place of articulation and VOT. Unlike real listeners, such a software model is amenable to analysis aimed at extracting the phonetic knowledge acquired in training, so providing a putative explanation of the categorization phenomenon. Here, we study three learning systems: single-layer perceptrons, support vector machines and Fisher linear discriminants. We highlight similarities and differences between these approaches. We find that the modern inductive inference technique for small sample sizes of support vector machines gives the most convincing results.

Instead, universality is best explained by Classical symbol systems, with Con- nectionism as its implementation. Here it is argued that universality is also a problem for Classicism in that the syntax-sensitive rules that are supposed to provide causal explanations of mental processes are either too strict, precluding possible generalizations; or too lax, providing no information as to the appropriate alternative.

Our proposed ASR system is less vulnerable to external interference noise, and achieves a higher WRA compared to a conventional ASR system equipped with MFCCs and an HMM. The performance of our proposed ASR system was evaluated using a phonetically balanced word (PBW) set mixed with artificially added noise.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5573/IEIESPC.2014.3.5.259", "venue": null, "journal": "IEIE Transactions on Smart Processing and Computing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2062576667", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14283618", "14190701", "9049364", "39519672", "46317289", "1314684", "15052804", "30530111", "206590483", "18056297", "199519887", "17923449", "961425", "659648"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55296076"}

The spontaneous speech is continuous, where the emotions are expressed in certain moments of the dialogue, given emotional turns. Therefore, it is necessary that the real-time applications are capable of detecting changes in the speaker's affective state. In this paper, we emphasize on recognizing activation from speech using a few feature set obtained from a temporal segmentation of the speech signal of different language like German, English and Polish. The feature set includes two prosodic features and four paralinguistic features related to the pitch and spectral energy balance. This segmentation and feature set are suitable for real-time emotion applications because they allow detect changes in the emotional state with very low processing times.

The motivation of using GAN is twofold: learning compatible cross-modal features in an adversarial way, and explanation of search results by showing the images generated from recipes. The novelty of R2GAN comes from architecture design, specifically a GAN with one generator and dual discriminators is used, which makes the generation of image from recipe a feasible idea. Furthermore, empowered by the generated images, a two-level ranking loss in both embedding and image spaces are considered.

In this work, we propose the use of generative adversarial networks for speech enhancement. In contrast to current techniques, we operate at the waveform level, training the model end-to-end, and incorporate 28 speakers and 40 different noise conditions into the same model, such that model parameters are shared across them.

The attributes based paradigm offers significant advantages including the ability to train classifiers without any visual examples. We begin by discussing a scenario for object recognition on mobile devices where the attribute prediction and the attribute-to-class mapping are decoupled in order to meet the specific resource constraints of mobile systems. We next present two extensions on the attribute based classification paradigm by introducing alternative approaches in attribute prediction and attribute-to-class mapping. For the attribute prediction, we employ the recently proposed Sparse Representations Classification scheme that offers significant benefits compared to the previous SVM based approaches, such as increased accuracy and elimination of the training stage.

In this work we present a CRF model were unary factors are dependent on a CNN. Our main contribution is an efficient and scalable, maximum likelihood-based, learning procedure to infer all model parameters jointly. Previous work either concentrated on piecewise-training, or maximum likelihood learning of restricted model families, such as Gaussian CRFs or CRFs with a few variables only. In contrast, we are the first to perform maximum likelihood learning for large-sized factor graphs with non-parametric potentials. We have applied our model to the task of semantic labeling of body parts in depth images. We show that it is superior to selected competing models and learning strategies.

This study investigates a minimal set of sensors to achieve effective screening for RBD in the population, integrating automated sleep staging (three state) followed by RBD detection without the need for cumbersome electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors. Polysomnography signals from 50 participants with RBD and 50 age-matched healthy controls were used to evaluate this study. Three stage sleep classification was achieved using a Random Forest (RF) classifier and features derived from a combination of cost-effective and easy to use sensors, namely electrocardiogram (ECG), electrooculogram (EOG), and electromyogram (EMG) channels. Subsequently, RBD detection was achieved using established and new metrics derived from ECG and EMG metrics. The EOG and EMG combination provided the best minimalist fully automated performance, achieving $0.57\\pm0.19$ kappa (3 stage) for sleep staging and an RBD detection accuracy of $0.90\\pm0.11$, (sensitivity, and specificity $0.88\\pm0.13$, and $0.92\\pm0.098$). A single ECG sensor allowed three state sleep staging with $0.28\\pm0.06$ kappa and RBD detection accuracy of $0.62\\pm0.10$.

The increasing interest in building autonomous mobile systems makes the detection and recognition of objects in indoor environments a very important and challenging task. In this work, a vision system to detect objects considering usual human environments, able to work on a real mobile robot, is developed. In the proposed system, the classification method used is Support Vector Machine (SVM) and as input to this system, RGB and depth images are used. Different segmentation techniques have been applied to each kind of object. Similarly, two alternatives to extract features of the objects are explored, based on geometric shape descriptors and bag of words.

The One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) is a state-of-the-art algorithm for estimating such regions from high dimensional data. Yet it suffers from practical limitations. When applied to a limited number of samples it can lead to poor performance even when picking the best hyperparameters. Moreover the solution of OCSVM is very sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which makes it hard to optimize in an unsupervised setting. We present a new approach to estimate MV sets using the OCSVM with a different choice of the parameter controlling the proportion of outliers. The solution function of the OCSVM is learnt on a training set and the desired probability mass is obtained by adjusting the offset on a test set to prevent overfitting. Models learnt on different train/test splits are then aggregated to reduce the variance induced by such random splits. Our approach makes it possible to tune the hyperparameters automatically and obtain nested set estimates. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the standard OCSVM formulation while suffering less from the curse of dimensionality than kernel density estimates.

It can be thought as a procedure to learn the labels on a training set, while, simultaneously, trying to guess the best labels on the test set. Intuitively, transductive learning has the advantage of being able to directly use training patterns while deciding on a test pattern. Thus, transductive learning faces a simpler problem with respect to inductive learning. In this paper, we propose a preliminary comparative study between a simple transductive model and a pure inductive model, where the learning architectures are based on feedforward neural networks. The goal is to understand how transductive learning affects the complexity measured by the number of hidden neurons of the exploited neural networks.

However, the detection range is always restricted, for existent emulation based detection techniques only take several features that are observed when shellcode is emulated. In this paper, we propose a new shellcode detection algorithm based on emulation and Support Vector Machine(SVM). One of the most prominent advantages is that by means of emulating, we can get the real executed path which includes key features to identify shellcode e.g. loop, xor, GetPC etc. Moreover, by recording aforementioned features and training them with SVM, we can rely on general features to detect shellcode rather than on specific features.

Metabolomics measures multiple cancer-related metabolites with potential to identify new biomarkers in this setting. We have shown that serum metabolomics can discriminate pts with eCRC from pts with metastatic CRC (mCRC). We hypothesized that a metabolomic score derived from pts with mCRC may identify pts with eCRC with an increased risk of relapse. This hypothesis was tested in a cohort of elderly pts with eCRC. Methods Serum samples from 103 pts aged \u226570 were collected from four clinical trials with 5 years follow up. These samples were derived from 55 pts with eCRC, and 48 with mCRC. Samples were retrospectively analyzed via proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), to assess their metabolomic fingerprints. A Random Forest (RF) classification model was built using a training set of 30 eCRC pts free from relapse at 5 years and all mCRC pts (N = 48). This model was then applied to a validation set constituted by the remaining eCRC pts (10 relapse-free and 15 relapsed). A risk-of-recurrence score was built on the basis of the likelihood of the sample being misclassified as metastatic. Results In the eCRC group, 44% (n = 24) received adjuvant chemotherapy, and 27% (n = 15) experienced relapse. In the training set, the RF model discriminated eCRC from mCRC with an accuracy of 74.4%. The RF risk of recurrence score correlated with relapse, with an AUC of 0.754 in ROC analysis. In the training set, by maximizing specificity and sensitivity, a threshold for the RF score was set at 0.55. In the validation set, using this threshold, an AUC of 0.727 in ROC analysis, and a prediction accuracy of 76% (73.3% sensitivity, 80% specificity) were obtained in predicting relapse. Conclusions Serum metabolomics performed on post-operative samples of elderly pts with eCRC identifies pts with higher risk of relapse with good accuracy. This may represent a tool to refine risk stratification in this population, to maximize the benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Based on these results, a prospective trial is ongoing (LIquid BIopsy and METabolomics in CRC - LIBIMET). Legal entity responsible for the study The authors.

Application layer DDoS Attack is derived from the lower layers. Application layer based DDoS attacks use legitimate HTTP requests after establishment of TCP three way hand shaking and overwhelms the victim resources, such as sockets, CPU, memory, disk, database bandwidth. Network layer based DDoS attacks sends the SYN, UDP and ICMP requests to the server and exhausts the bandwidth. An anomaly detection mechanism is proposed in this paper to detect DDoS attacks using Enhanced Support Vector Machine (ESVM). The Application layer DDoS Attack such as HTTP Flooding, DNS Spoofing and Network layer DDoS Attack such as Port Scanning, TCP Flooding, UDP Flooding, ICMP Flooding, Land Flooding. Session Flooding are taken as test samples for ESVM. The Normal user access behavior attributes is taken as training samples for ESVM.

Support vector machine is one of the leading machine learning algorithms. Methods/Statistical Analysis: We propose an optimization approach of support vector machines that optimizes its regularization parameter to further improve its prediction accuracy in a human activity recognition application. In order to implement an efficient support vector machines predictive model of a particular dataset that would generalize well and have a good prediction performance, a suitable regularization parameter has to be applied in the regularization part of the equation. Findings: In order to empirically evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we show the results of our implementation and discuss the results of our proposed approach explained in the previous section on support vector machines models. From our experiments, we can see that we got fabulous results when the regularization parameter is 1000. For the accuracy on train/test dataset pair, we got a sufficiently high percentage for regularization parameter values of 10, 100 and 1000. And, the best cross validation accuracy is 98.8575, which is corresponding to a regularization parameter value of 1000. Additionally, we can also notice that the relation between the classification accuracy and the cross validation accuracy is proportional, and that is obvious in the accuracies responding to the regularization parameter of 0.0001, because both accuracies are significantly low. Improvements/Applications: Our idea was to replace the parameter value with a vector of parameter values and compare their results.

Their popularity is mainly driven by their high computational efficiency during both training and evaluation while achieving state-of-the-art results. However, in most applications RFs are used off-line. This limits their usability for many practical problems, for instance, when training data arrives sequentially or the underlying distribution is continuously changing. In this paper, we propose a novel on-line random forest algorithm. We combine ideas from on-line bagging, extremely randomized forests and propose an on-line decision tree growing procedure. Additionally, we add a temporal weighting scheme for adaptively discarding some trees based on their out-of-bag-error in given time intervals and consequently growing of new trees. The experiments on common machine learning data sets show that our algorithm converges to the performance of the off-line RF. Additionally, we conduct experiments for visual tracking, where we demonstrate real-time state-of-the-art performance on well-known scenarios and show good performance in case of occlusions and appearance changes where we outperform trackers based on on-line boosting.

We have first tried to replicate the prior results of transfer learning in semantically related tasks. When we have semantically different tasks, we tried using Progressive Neural Networks. We also experimented on sharing the encoder from neural machine translator to classification tasks.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-04182-3_17", "venue": "ICONIP", "journal": null, "mag_id": "2900882135", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54440247"}

The most popular systems that are used frequently include the classical trigonometric Fourier, orthogonal polynomial, and spline systems. In recent applications the wavelet methods turned to be especially effective. Yet we propose another system that is built from basic rational functions. The rational orthogonal systems, i.e. the Malmquist-Takenaka systems, we use are determined by parameters called poles and multiplicities. This way we have infinitely many systems at hand. The main advantage of our approach is its flexibility. The parameters that control the system can be adjusted to the particular problem. It means that in ECG processing we may change them even from heartbeat to heartbeat. We have worked out the proper discretization of the original mathematical model [2-3] and designed optimization processes adapted to these systems [4]. The result is a special variable projection method. The algorithms we constructed turned to be very efficient. They outperform the existing ones in many respects [7]. Problems we considered so far include QRS modeling [4], R peak detection, ECG compression, heartbeat classification [1]. The tests were evaluated on the standard public MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database available on PhysioNet [5]. We note that our algorithms are fast enough for real time applications, and also for big databases. one may use them as a tool for supporting cardiologists among others as a preprocessing long time records (Holter) or as a built in alert function. So far we have concentrated on ECG processing methods that work well in general circumstances. For instance in case of classification we constructed a mixed feature vector that consists of dynamic and morphological features. The morphological features, which can be divided into patient specific and heartbeat specific components, come from rational transforms. Then we used a so called Support Vector Machine classifier for them. The method can be performed for multiple leads independently or even together, and then we can combine the individual results to obtain an improved final result. Recently, we have been focusing on more specific situations where we take various aspects into consideration. In particular we have been working on a version designed for subject-based classification Moreover we have been refining the classification algorithm in order to reduce the rate of false negative results. In connection with it various evaluation and fusion techniques have been investigated. We note that our method can be efficient for medical signals other than ECG.

Since ads are usually hard to understand only according to its visual appearance due to the contained visual metaphor, some other modalities, such as the contained texts, should be exploited for understanding. To further improve user experience, it is necessary to understand both the topic and sentiment of the ads. This motivates us to develop a novel deep multimodal multitask framework to integrate multiple modalities to achieve effective topic and sentiment prediction simultaneously for ads understanding. In particular, our model first extracts multimodal information from ads and learn high-level and comparable representations. The visual metaphor of the ad is decoded in an unsupervised manner. The obtained representations are then fed into the proposed hierarchical multimodal attention modules to learn task-specific representations for final prediction. A multitask loss function is also designed to train both the topic and sentiment prediction models jointly in an end-to-end manner.

Finally, based on this weighted matrix, the idea of locality preserving projection algorithm is applied to reduce the dimensions of hyperspectral image data. The use of spectral angle to measure the distance between pixels can effectively overcome the spectral amplitude error caused by the uncertainty. At the same time, the use of geodesic distance to construct weight matrix can better reflect the internal structure of the data manifold than the use of Euclidean distance. Therefore, the proposed methods can reserve effectively the original characters of dataset with less loss in the useful information and less distortion on the data structure.

Accurate modeling and forecasting of the building energy use intensity (EUI) in the urban scale have many important applications, such as energy benchmarking and urban energy infrastructure planning. The use of Big Data technology is expected to have the capability of integrating a large number of predictors and giving an accurate prediction of the energy use intensity of buildings in the urban scale. However, past research has often used Big Data technology in estimating energy consumption of a single building rather than the urban scale, due to several challenges such as data collection and feature engineering. This paper therefore proposes a geographic information system integrated data mining methodology framework for estimating the building EUI in the urban scale, including preprocessing, feature selection, and algorithm optimization. Based on 216 prepared features, a case study on estimating the site EUI of 3640 multi-family residential buildings in New York City, was tested and validated using the proposed methodology framework. A comparative study on the feature selection strategies and the commonly used regression algorithms was also included in the case study. The results show that the framework was able to help produce lower estimation errors than previous research, and the model built by the Support Vector Regression algorithm on the features selected by Elastic Net has the least cross-validation mean squared error.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.08.079", "venue": null, "journal": "Applied Energy", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2515244244", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["110594900", "110065593", "5400683", "110329630", "109491491", "110497388", "109186305", "110594569", "108509147", "110587318", "111171726", "73711744", "96423416", "113401078", "54505419", "109124429", "111145463", "53048353", "57146809", "1857697", "109400929", "108456368", "109082362", "107028977", "110168422", "108688677", "109389033", "108813563", "110145479", "108805285", "110664376", "379259", "125283389", "109246090", "15700257", "121589596", "16162039", "14134075", "111055100", "11715509", "11008018", "743542", "166404525", "109926873", "10142996", "17641174"], "inbound_citations": ["55876076", "11941677", "155842011", "30287388", "69221003", "198147645", "214701629", "52303689", "201243549", "115492405", "53358703", "204816777", "201066257", "53228796"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:114236241"}

The dependence between these patterns introduces style context within a group that can be exploited to improve the classification accuracy. ::: We propose a framework for style consistent classification with nonparametric methods for discrete style case, i.e., applications with a finite number of styles such that the sample size relative to each style is \"sufficient\". Our work is motivated by previous work on style consistent classification with Gaussian mixture densities. The fewer assumptions on forms of underlying distributions and higher accuracies in most practical applications make nonparametric methods attractive candidates for extension to style consistent classification. Using this framework, we extend the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method---one of the most popular classification techniques proposed in the last decade---to style consistent classification. The nearest neighbor (NN) method, another nonparametric method with asymptotic classification error less than twice the optimal Bayes error, is also extended to style consistent classification using the same framework. Inspired by the geometry of class-and-style distributions in the feature space, we propose frequency coding, a novel nonparametric classification method, for single-label classification. Frequency coding lends itself naturally to style consistent classification within the proposed framework. ::: We conduct extensive simulations on pseudo-randomly generated data to gain insight into the benefits and the limitations of proposed methods.

A multiple-trees classification technique, namely Random Forest (RF), was applied. Specific objectives were: (i) to analyze the role and importance of a large data set of environmental predictors, (ii) to investigate the effect of the number of training points, forest size (ntree), the numbers of predictors sampled per node (mtry) and tree size (nodesize) in RF; (iii) to compare RF-derived maps with maps derived with a multinomial logistic regression model, in terms of validation error (test set and independent profiles) and map uncertainty, using the confusion index and a newly developed reliability index. The optimized RF model was run using half of the input points available (over a million) and with ntree equal to 350. The mtry parameter was set to 5 (close to half the number of the environmental variables used) for both soil series and soil properties. The nodesize calibration showed no relevant performance increase and was kept at its default value (1). In terms of environmental variables, the model used 10 predictors, covering all the soil formation factors considered in the scorpan formula, to derive the three maps. Soil properties, derived from geochemistry data, showed a high importance in deriving soil groups, depths and texture.

However, a well-known drawback of k-NN is its dependence on the quality of the training set, since the k-NN makes no assumption about the importance of each instance. In fact, the existence of noisy and superfluous instances in the training set tends to increase the classification error rate. Thus, instance selection methods are useful to identify which instances belonging to the training set will be considered in the k-NN classifier. Our proposal shows a simple and effective way to improve instance selection methods using metric learning. The idea of our proposal relies on a pure geometric intuition that metric learning transforms the input space where points in the same class are simultaneously near each other and far from points in the other classes. In a more \u201corganised\u201d space, we show that instance selection methods can benefit from this transformed space. We carried out an experimental evaluation to compare the instance selection with and without metric learning on UCI benchmark data sets.

In this paper we propose SOMNet which uses self-organizing map (SOM) based filters offering a non-orthogonal alternative to PCANet providing comparable performance. It is well established that SOM is a non-linear version of PCA but does not suffer from the same constraints.

In order to adapt to the gradual changes in sEMG characteristics, we utilized incremental learning based on the wavelet neural network (WNN) ensemble, and used negative correlation learning (NCL) to train it. To verify the effect of the proposed method, a group of subjects executed six hand motions in a continual experiment for more than 2 h. Compared with the fixed pattern recognition model, the classification accuracy rate of incremental learning with nonintegration becomes substantially improved. In addition, the results of the WNN ensemble with the fixed-size mode are more stable than those of the WNN ensemble with the growth mode. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can recognize the gradual changes in sEMG characteristics stably.

Through the experiments on real images, we validate our proposed method, which can manipulate the generated images as desired by controlling the latent codes of input variables. In addition, the visual qualities of produced images are effectively maintained, and the model can stably converge to the equilibrium.

Applied to modern big data, these methods often require a large number of sub-learners, where the complexity of each learner typically grows with the size of the dataset.

This problem mostly manifests in a subscriber based environment, where a user-specific ensemble needs to be stored on a personal device with strict storage limitations (such as a cellular device). In this work we introduce a novel method for lossless compression of tree-based ensemble methods, focusing on random forests. Our suggested method is based on probabilistic modeling of the ensemble's trees, followed by model clustering via Bregman divergence. This allows us to find a minimal set of models that provides an accurate description of the trees, and at the same time is small enough to store and maintain. Our compression scheme demonstrates high compression rates on a variety of modern datasets. Importantly, our scheme enables predictions from the compressed format and a perfect reconstruction of the original ensemble.

In the present study the solar radiation time series prediction combines the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models. The EMD is an adaptive signal processing technique that decomposes the nonstationary and nonlinear signals into a set of components with a different spatial frequency content. It results in a small set of new time series that are easier to model and predict. The SVR is applied to the new solar radiation time series.

However, this definition does not take into account the \u2018time to response\u2019, therefore not allowing for any differentiation between response rates. Of course, time to response can be an important factor when trying to determine features influencing the efficacy to antidepressant treatments as the genetic backgrounds of \u2018fast\u2019 and \u2018slow\u2019 responders may be different. By taking into consideration both depression scores and time to response, we can find new features that may serve as predictors. Additionally, many genetic differences may impact the efficacy to antidepressants, and analysis of combinations of genetic factors is needed to define novel predictors of response to antidepressant treatments. We applied novel methods, based on this logic, to design a prediction model of efficacy to Venlafaxine treatment. Methods Using the raw data of the Sequence Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR \u204e D) clinical trial, we have designed two response models for the Venlafaxine treatment group: 1. A percentage of depression score reduction using the first and last scores. 2. An exponential formula, taking into account all depression scores for each patient, and plotted against their number of days in treatment. For genetic feature selection, we have applied a genome--wide association approach, and then developed a prediction model by applying machine learning algorithms to define combinations of parameters that predict response for Venlafaxine. Results Out of the 135 patients who were treated with Venlafaxine, the 50% depression score reduction approach found that 51 patients were responders and 84 patients were non-responders. The exponential approach however, labeled 66 patients as responders and 69 patients as non-responders. We split the Venlafaxine group into train and validation groups. The split was performed randomly to remove bias. Genome-wide association analysis identified two genetic features for the Venlafaxine model only for the exponential response model groups, but not for the 50% depression score reduction approach. After feature selection was performed, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) machine learning algorithm with a linear kernel was applied. The prediction model yielded the following results on the validation group: Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.8511, accuracy of 77.50%, sensitivity of 76.19%, specificity of 78.95%, positive predictive value of 80.00% and negative predictive value of 75.00%. Discussion Genome-wide association analysis on a two-dimensional response model taking into consideration both changes in depression score and time of response, revealed novel features which predict the response to Venlafaxine. These features could not be found using the commonly used one-dimensional 50% depression score reduction model, emphasizing the strengths of using a two-dimensional approach. Furthermore, by using machine learning algorithms we have managed to design a highly accurate prediction model of response to Venlafaxine, based on the combinatorial approach between the genetic features we identified by genome-wide association. Applying new models and new algorithmic methods on currently available large datasets can lead to novel findings which will advance our understanding of psychiatric disorders, and advance the design of accurate prediction models for psychiatric medications.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.euroneuro.2017.08.112", "venue": "European Neuropsychopharmacology", "journal": "European Neuropsychopharmacology", "mag_id": "2925176598", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:85493869"}

Wind energy is one of the important renewable energy resources. Therefore, efficient and consistent utilization of wind energy has been an important issue. The wind speed has the characteristics of intermittence and instability. If the wind power is directly connected to the grid, it will impact the voltage and frequency of the power system. Short-term wind power prediction can reduce the impact of wind power on the power grid and the stability of power system operation is guaranteed. In this study, the improved chicken swarm algorithm optimization support vector machine (ICSO-SVM) model is proposed to predict the wind power. The traditional chicken swarm optimization algorithm (CSO) easily falls into a local optimum when solving high-dimensional problems due to its own characteristics. So the CSO algorithm is improved and the ICSO algorithm is developed. In order to verify the validity of the ICSO-SVM model, the following work has been done.

Dissertation supervised by Miroslav Kubat, Ph.D. No. of pages in text. (256) The Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a blueprint for writing computer programs capable of solving search and optimization problems. The GA blueprint describes an iterative search process that seeks to improve the quality of an initial random set of solutions (known as a \u201cpopulation of specimens\u201d) with respect to some user-defined optimization criteria. All of the components of this iterative search process mimic Darwinian biological evolutionary processes such as mating, recombination, mutation, and survival of the fittest. Thus, the GA is an evolutionary approach to search and optimization. The GA has been applied to thousands of research and industrial applications across numerous domains of science. Due to its success and popularity, researchers have attempted to improve various aspects of the GA search process over the years. However, the impact of the mating strategy, which determines how existing solutions to a problem are paired during the genetic search process to generate new and better solutions, has so far been neglected in the rich and vast GA literature. The long-standing conventional mating strategy, which has been used for decades in implementations of the GA, is based on the random selection of mating partners. This paradigm has known issues. First, due to its stochastic nature, the conventional mating strategy does not guarantee that the solutions paired to generate new solutions have orthogonal (or independent) information content. This leads the GA to under-utilize the information available for the genetic search process. Second, the conventional mating strategy promotes highly-fit solutions to mate more often than others. These highly-fit solutions eventually overrun the entire set of solutions during the genetic search process, leading to issues of premature convergence to suboptimal solutions. The goal of this work is to show that the GA search process can be expedited, with the quality of its solutions improved, by replacing the conventional mating strategy with more sophisticated ones that are inspired from the Darwinian principle of \u201dopposites-attract.\u201d The mating strategies proposed in this work improve over the conventional mating strategy, in which specimens (or solutions) have no mating choice, by \u201cendowing\u201d specimens in the GA population with mating-instincts that promote a more diverse pairing of solutions. The end result is an improved utilization of the information available for the genetic search process to discover new and better solutions and, consequently, a more efficient sampling of the solution search space of complex optimization problems. A total of five novel \u201cinstinct-based\u201d mating strategies are proposed in this work. Four of these mating strategies are designed as single-population GA mating strategies, and one as a multi-population GA mating strategy. The five proposed mating strategies are collectively referred to by the acronym IM-GA, which stands for Instinct-Based Mating in Genetic Algorithms. To measure the effectiveness of the proposed mating strategies, they were tested on two well-known, complex optimization iii problems from the domain of supervised classification: 1) the 1-NN Tuning problem (\u201cTestbed Problem 1\u201d), and 2) the Optimal Decision Forests problem (\u201cTestbed problem 2\u201d). The 1-NN Tuning problem involves the search for optimal subsets of examples and attributes that simultaneously maximize the accuracy and minimizes the classification costs of the 1-NN classifier. The Optimal Decision Forests problem involves the search for highly-accurate and compact decision tree classifiers that can be grouped into ensembles to simultaneously maximize their combined voting classification accuracy while minimizing the overall classification costs. Testbed Problem 1 was solved by an improved implementation of a well-known GA, the RK-GA (hereinafter \u201cbaseline RK-GA0\u201d). Testbed Problem 2 was solved by a novel GA that was implemented for the purposes of this research, the baseline TMGA0. Rigorous experiments were performed to evaluate the performances of these two GAs both with and without the proposed IM-GA \u201cinstinct-based\u201d mating strategies. The various data sets used in the experiments were taken from the well-known UCI Machine Learning Repository. The experimental results indicated a statistically significant increase in the search speed of the GA when the IM-GA mating strategies were applied to the two chosen testbed problems. Furthermore, this increased search speed did not come at the cost of the quality of the discovered solutions and required only negligible additional computational overhead. Therefore, this work shows that more sophisticated mating strategies can indeed improve the genetic search process over the conventional mating strategy.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "1853785", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:108132372"}

To address this challenge, we introduce a Differentially Private Conditional GAN (DP-CGAN) training framework based on a new clipping and perturbation strategy, which improves the performance of the model while preserving privacy of the training dataset. DP-CGAN generates both synthetic data and corresponding labels and leverages the recently introduced Renyi differential privacy accountant to track the spent privacy budget.

The 20th century can be considered the century of psychology on learning and related fields of interest (such as motivation, cognition, metacognition etc.) and it is fascinating to see the various mainstreams of learning, remembered and forgotten over the 20th century and note that basic assumptions of early theories survived several paradigm shifts of psychology and epistemology. Beyond folk psychology and its naive theories of learning, psychological learning theories can be grouped into some basic categories, such as behaviorist learning theories, connectionist learning theories, cognitive learning theories, constructivist learning theories, and social learning theories. ::: Learning theories are not limited to psychology and related fields of interest but rather we can find the topic of learning in various disciplines, such as philosophy and epistemology, education, information science, biology, and \u2013 as a result of the emergence of computer technologies \u2013 especially also in the field of computer sciences and artificial intelligence. As a consequence, machine learning struck a chord in the 1980s and became an important field of the learning sciences in general. As the learning sciences became more specialized and complex, the various fields of interest were widely spread and separated from each other; as a consequence, even presently, there is no comprehensive overview of the sciences of learning or the central theoretical concepts and vocabulary on which researchers rely. ::: The Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning provides an up-to-date, broad and authoritative coverage of the specific terms mostly used in the sciences of learning and its related fields, including relevant areas of instruction, pedagogy, cognitive sciences, and especially machine learning and knowledge engineering. This modern compendium will be an indispensable source of information for scientists, educators, engineers, and technical staff active in all fields of learning. More specifically, the Encyclopedia provides fast access to the most relevant theoretical terms provides up-to-date, broad and authoritative coverage of the most important theories within the various fields of the learning sciences and adjacent sciences and communication technologies; supplies clear and precise explanations of the theoretical terms, cross-references to related entries and up-to-date references to important research and publications.

Application of such artificial intelligence can be used to perform automatic document retrieval and interpretation by a robot through query. So, it is necessary to extract the key information from the document based on the query to produce the desired feedback. For this purpose, in this paper we propose a system for automatic date field extraction from multi-lingual (English, Devnagari and Bangla scripts) handwritten documents. The date is a key piece of information, which can be used in various robotic applications such as date-wise document indexing/retrieval. In order to design the system, first the script of the document is identified, and based on the identified script, word components of each text line are classified into month and non-month classes using word-level feature extraction and classification. Next, non-month words are segmented into individual components and labelled into one of text, digit, punctuation or contraction categories. Subsequently, the date patterns are searched using the labelled components. Both numeric and semi-numeric regular expressions have been used for date part extraction. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and profile feature-based approaches are used for classification of month/non-month words. Other date components such as numerals and punctuation marks are recognised using a gradient-based feature and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The experiments are performed on English, Devnagari and Bangla document datasets and the encouraging results obtained from the system indicate the effectiveness of the proposed system.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.ins.2014.08.037", "venue": "Inf.

Different from traditional SVMs, IKSVM essentially is a non-convex optimization problem. Some algorithms directly change the spectrum of the indefinite kernel matrix at the cost of losing some valuable information involved in the kernels so as to transform the non-convex problem into a convex one. Other algorithms aim to solve the dual form of IKSVM, but suffer from the dual gap between the primal and dual problems in the case of indefinite kernels. In this paper, we directly focus on the non-convex primal form of IKSVM and propose a novel algorithm termed as IKSVM-DC. According to the characteristics of the spectrum for the indefinite kernel matrix, IKSVM-DC decomposes the objective function into the subtraction of two convex functions and thus reformulates the primal problem as a difference of convex functions (DC) programming which can be optimized by the DC algorithm (DCA). In order to accelerate convergence rate, IKSVM-DC further combines the classical DCA with a line search step along the descent direction at each iteration. A theoretical analysis is then presented to validate that IKSVM-DC can converge to a local minimum.

By modeling the conditional distributions over part locations, our system also enables conditioning on arbitrary subsets of parts (e.g. only the beak and tail), yielding an efficient interface for picking part locations.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": "1610.02454", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2952434594,2530372461", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["11617315", "206592419", "1282515", "15960930", "8122361", "1033682", "1930231", "6099034", "7732372", "14020873", "13975441", "9996719", "3147510", "11758569", "1836951", "1563370", "16895865", "5985692", "877639", "2865509", "8142135", "2592001"], "inbound_citations": ["41191245", "30484693", "199551887", "15117981", "195832046", "59222683", "33991152", "202776726", "204800987", "198968283", "90263712", "53792310", "52288950", "19572111", "88518761", "59316571", "212747946", "215416330", "202763864", "1889936", "957723", "51937500", "5019772", "4593810", "155992514", "204748499", "208857532", "106403784", "53973622", "54006369", "208631070", "209202571", "4679427", "116505", "4874038", "21012775", "145982865", "211243049", "202577442", "208986748", "212114269", "211210332", "211679084", "204509571", "211554183", "119313647", "208248099", "52078253", "209496821", "32016035", "14984990", "56012030", "13748852", "46898260", "209538936", "207973242", "21812868", "58675915", "41321603", "41321603", "211004079", "116320485", "201698190", "4752763", "4753049", "199441622", "203642491", "1925189", "209324092", "13680945", "209901061", "198899164", "31682332", "52066874", "146120783", "203952145", "24527328", "195782366", "91184051", "53103701", "70097504", "36044521", "199442429", "29154127", "4340299", "209376158", "8858625", "156054993", "208634138", "53410211", "7849608", "102341890", "3397048", "210157341", "53649564", "197642478", "3355038", "199577366", "199668937", "49905171", "202542542", "53774782", "67855413", "5683633", "69273727", "3488631", "131773746", "58981964", "202661385", "198917605", "196189662", "195791421", "36011704", "3459663", "207852771", "19059279", "202780158", "202783730", "208291249", "4654017", "56175274", "6647435", "88514467", "207831043", "20640550", "25545248", "179895", "58029008", "210930149", "215238895", "191157580", "53047201", "57373791", "202765776", "208309765", "4956308", "195346163", "102352602", "33391968", "91183909", "49206478", "8525940", "212703572", "58006524", "52004801", "49319704", "49876117", "53846656", "53997451", "52305483", "4379530", "8448539", "49653092", "1277217", "51936469", "33360855", "8355505", "8191987", "7527597", "15514398", "1099052", "76661216", "3604848", "210839653", "52840724", "20404279", "59222854", "211057654", "86653678", "167210440", "202691135", "3370894", "15624550", "213176719", "61153376", "58004734", "196150698", "208156927", "3614800", "209500550", "57375714", "4707877", "54441528", "44075864", "153312731", "3646966", "59234295", "57573669", "174800473", "70342378", "67856728", "211252382", "4855369", "196623655", "211205490", "211038546", "27771375", "14683676", "204949374", "173990565", "37226097", "18500294", "211253750", "211163987", "118687112", "53782342", "53643967", "125978751", "3458362", "210888547", "3847983", "52058402", "4565882"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1515901"}

Effective prediction of timing of delivery among women identified to be at significant risk for preterm birth would allow proper implementation of prophylactic therapeutic interventions. This paper aims first to develop a model that acts as a decision support system for pregnant women at high risk of delivering prematurely before having cervical cerclage. The model will predict whether the pregnancy will continue beyond 26 weeks\u2019 gestation and the potential value of adding the cerclage in prolonging the pregnancy. The second aim is to develop a model that predicts the timing of spontaneous delivery in this high risk cohort after cerclage. The model will help treating physicians to define the chronology of management in relation to the risk of preterm birth, reducing the neonatal complications associated with it. Data from 274 pregnancies managed with cervical cerclage were included. 29 of the procedures involved multiple pregnancies. To build the first model, a data balancing technique called SMOTE was applied to overcome the problem of highly imbalanced class distribution in the dataset. After that, four classification models, namely Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), and Neural Network (NN) were used to build the prediction model. The results showed that Random Forest classifier gave the best results in terms of G-mean and sensitivity with values of 0.96 and 1.00, respectively. These results were achieved at an oversampling ratio of 200%. For the second prediction model, five classification models were used to predict the time of spontaneous delivery; linear regression, Gaussian process, Random Forest, K-star, and LWL classifier. The Random Forest classifier performed best, with 0.752 correlation value. In conclusion, computational models can be developed to predict the need for cerclage and the gestation of delivery after this procedure. These models have moderate/high sensitivity for clinical application.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "32106071", "doi": "10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2020.107233", "venue": "Computational biology and chemistry", "journal": "Computational biology and chemistry", "mag_id": "3006506024", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:211556498"}

To overcome the limitations of scale in existing works, our proposed algorithms allow every mobile sensing agent to choose a different support set and dynamically switch to another during execution for encapsulating its own data into a local summary that, perhaps surprisingly, can still be assimilated with the other agents' local summaries (i.e., based on their current choices of support sets) into a globally consistent summary to be used for predicting the phenomenon. To achieve this, we propose a novel transfer learning mechanism for a team of agents capable of sharing and transferring information encapsulated in a summary based on a support set to that utilizing a different support set with some loss that can be theoretically bounded and analyzed. To alleviate the issue of information loss accumulating over multiple instances of transfer learning, we propose a new information sharing mechanism to be incorporated into our algorithms in order to achieve memory-efficient lazy transfer learning.

To date, most studies focused on short-term effects of bariatric surgery on the metabolic profile and found high variation in the individual responses to surgery. The aim of this study was to identify relevant metabolic changes not only shortly after bariatric surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) but also up to one year after the intervention by using untargeted metabolomics. 132 serum samples taken from 44 patients before surgery, after hospital discharge (1\u20133 weeks after surgery) and at a 1-year follow-up during a prospective study (NCT01271062) performed at two study centers (Austria and Switzerland). The samples included 24 patients with type 2 diabetes at baseline, thereof 9 with diabetes remission after one year. The samples were analyzed by using liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS, HILIC-QExactive). Raw data was processed with XCMS and drift-corrected through quantile regression based on quality controls. 177 relevant metabolic features were selected through Random Forests and univariate testing and 36 metabolites were identified. Identified metabolites included trimethylamine-N-oxide, alanine, phenylalanine and indoxyl-sulfate which are known markers for cardiovascular risk. In addition we found a significant decrease in alanine after one year in the group of patients with diabetes remission relative to non-remission. Our analysis highlights the importance of assessing multiple points in time in subjects undergoing bariatric surgery to enable the identification of biomarkers for treatment response, cardiovascular benefit and diabetes remission.

Efforts are made to select an optimal set of targets for which to start the training of a set of predictors.

First, we introduce a framework for automatically inferring the travel modes and trip purposes of human movement when tracked by a GPS device. We utilize a multiple changepoints algorithm to divide trajectories into segments using only speed data. Then, Random Forest is used to classify segments into moving and not-moving types. For moving segments, travel mode (car, bus, train, walk, and bike) is predicted. Next, multiple machine learning algorithms are employed, validated, and tested to identify the most suitable model for inferring trip purposes. The overall accuracy for prediction is over 80% on the testing set, both with and without data on socio-demographic variables. The model also predicts \"shop\" trips with an accuracy of 92.1%, while its accuracy for \"go home\" and \"studying\" trips reaches 100%. Additionally, we utilize the classification results in the first stage of research to compare households' travel patterns from before a new light rail transit line began service to two periods of time after service began. Our results indicate that, although the average of activity duration varies significantly over days of week and waves, the random effect of these two factors on activity duration was minor; time of day contributed over one third of the total variance in the duration. Finally, the dissertation demonstrates uses of Twitter data as a potentially important data source to understand comments, criticisms, and responses about light rail in Los Angeles. The results of information flow analysis, sentiment estimation, topic modeling, and its application can be useful for exploring trends among commuters and how their sentiment changed according to the light rail line they used, the time of day, and the day of the week.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2521421959", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["81986803"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:114452849"}

Second, detection of the most common AUs in the context of car driving, identified by a certified Facial Action Coding System coder is presented. For detection of each specified AU, the spatio-temporal analysis of related tracked facial points is performed. Then, a combination of rule-based scheme with Probabilistic Actively Learned Support Vector Machines is developed to classify the features calculated from the related tracked facial points.

Support Vector Machines are a system for efficiently training the linear learning machines introduced in Chapter 2 in the kernel-induced feature spaces described in Chapter 3, while respecting the insights provided by the generalisation theory of Chapter 4, and exploiting the optimisation theory of Chapter 5. An important feature of these systems is that, while enforcing the learning biases suggested by the generalisation theory, they also produce \u2018sparse\u2019 dual representations of the hypothesis, resulting in extremely efficient algorithms. This is due to the Karush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tucker conditions, which hold for the solution and play a crucial role in the practical implementation and analysis of these machines. Another important feature of the Support Vector approach is that due to Mercer's conditions on the kernels the corresponding optimisation problems are convex and hence have no local minima. This fact, and the reduced number of non-zero parameters, mark a clear distinction between these system and other pattern recognition algorithms, such as neural networks. This chapter will also describe the optimisation required to implement the Bayesian learning strategy using Gaussian processes.

The MapReduce paradigm has frequently proven to be a simple yet flexible and scalable technique to distribute algorithms across thousands of nodes and petabytes of information. Under these circumstances, classic data mining algorithms have been adapted to this model, in order to run in production environments. Unfortunately, the high latency nature of this architecture has relegated the applicability of these algorithms to batch-processing scenarios. In spite of this shortcoming, the emergence of massively threaded shared-memory multiprocessors, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPU), on the commodity computing market has enabled these algorithms to be executed orders of magnitude faster, while keeping the same MapReduce based model. In this paper, we propose the integration of massively threaded shared-memory multiprocessors into MapReduce-based clusters creating a unified heterogeneous architecture that enables executing Map and Reduce operators on thousands of threads across multiple GPU devices and nodes, while maintaining the built-in reliability of the baseline system. For this purpose, we created a programming model that facilitates the collaboration of multiple CPU cores and multiple GPU devices towards the resolution of a data intensive problem. In order to prove the potential of this hybrid system, we take a popular NP-Hard supervised learning algorithm, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and show that a 36x \u2013 192x speedup can be achieved on large datasets without changing the model or leaving the commodity hardware paradigm.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6083839", "venue": "2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics", "journal": "2011 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1973444179", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["6392609", "2315965", "207166250", "1428008", "15690554", "12050666", "207169888", "169134", "183466", "2127615", "10771764", "53113435", "204874467", "11725419", "15674212", "961425", "14542261", "11027141", "17505086"], "inbound_citations": ["8539119", "211551782", "38357009", "12865579", "10239281", "26309781", "5824133", "27859878", "16473559", "59230991", "42520928", "729106", "7616915"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:22777706"}

The CMM framework combines a priori knowledge encoded as features with a set of labeled training data to learn an efficient extraction process. We will show that similar problems can be solved more effectively by learning a discriminative context free grammar from training data. The grammar has several distinct advantages: long range, even global, constraints can be used to disambiguate entity labels; training data is used more efficiently; and a set of new more powerful features can be introduced. The grammar based approach also results in semantic information (encoded in the form of a parse tree) which could be used for IR applications like question answering. The specific problem we consider is of extracting personal contact, or address, information from unstructured sources such as documents and emails. While linear-chain CMMs perform reasonably well on this task, we show that a statistical parsing approach results in a 50% reduction in error rate.

This letter proposes to exploit off-feature information to help suppress the intraclass variation of the feature vectors. For face recognition, some identity-independent information such as pose, expression, and occlusion is extracted from source images and utilized as the off-feature information to enhance the performance of distance metric learning. In training, the algorithm learns how to incorporate the off-feature information to suppress the intraclass variation of features. In recognition, the similarity score of a face image pair is determined by its distance in feature space and that of off-feature space.

The idea of incorporating several data sources in analysis may be beneficial by reducing the noise, as well as by improving statistical significance and leveraging the interactions and correlations between data sources to obtain more refined and higher-level information [50], which is known as data fusion. In bioinformatics, considerable effort has been devoted to genomic data fusion, which is an emerging topic pertaining to a lot of applications. At present, terabytes of data are generated by high-throughput techniques at an increasing rate. In data fusion, these terabytes are further multiplied by the number of data sources or the number of species. A statistical model describing this data is therefore not an easy matter. To tackle this challenge, it is rather effective to consider the data as being generated by a complex and unknown black box with the goal of finding a function or an algorithm that operates on an input to predict the output.

Pioneering statistical approaches investigate manually defined features to capture lexical, sentiment, and event information, which suffer from feature sparsity. As a remedy, recent work has considered learning dense vector representations for documents. Such representations are general, which can not model target-dependent scenarios, such as stance detection towards a specific claim. There has been work on target-specific word and sentence representations, but little was done on target-dependent document representation. Moreover, documents contain more potentially helpful information, but also noise compared to events and sentences. To address the above issues, we focus on models that are: 1. task-driven , which optimize the neural network representations for the end task; 2. target-specific , learning news representations by considering the influence of specific targets. In particular, we propose a novel document-level target-dependent learning framework TEND. The framework employs the information of the target and the news abstract as clues, obtaining relatively informative sentences from the entire document for our objectives. The framework assembles a document representation by integrating the news abstract representation and a weighted sum of sentence representations in the document. To the best of our knowledge, we are among the first to investigate target-dependent document representation. Existing text representation models can be easily integrated into our TEND framework, and it is general enough to be applied to different target-dependent document representation tasks. We empirically evaluate our framework on two target-dependent document-level tasks, including a cumulative abnormal return prediction task and a news stance detection task.

The second consists of full body motion capture data taken from subjects diagnosed with chronic lower back pain. A synchronized electromyographic signal from the lumbar paraspinal muscles is taken as a pain-related behavioural indicator.

Especially the unexpected changes may manifest without notice, which can have a big impact on the performance, costs, and compliance. Thus it is important to detect these hidden changes early in order to prevent monetary consequences. Traditional process mining techniques are unable to identify these execution changes because they usually generalise without considering time as an extra dimension, and assume stable processes. Most algorithms only produce a single process model, reflecting the behaviour of the complete analysis scope. Small changes cannot be identified as they only occur in a small part of the event log.

Hierarchical learning based on ELM has now attracted lots of interests. This paper presents a hierarchical pruning discriminative ELM (H-PDELM) for feature learning and classification. The ELM pruning auto-encoder (ELM-PAE) is developed for unsupervised feature learning by promoting the output weights matrix to be row-sparse based on l2, 1-norm regularization. ELM-PAE can naturally distinguish and prune useless neurons in hidden layer to determine the structure of AE. Besides, we learn a flexible output weights matrix for supervised feature classification by relaxing the strict regression label matrix of ELM into a slack one for better generalization performance. H-PDELM performs layer-wise unsupervised feature learning using ELM-PAE, and conducts decision making by the flexible output weights matrix.

Therefore, imbalanced classification is a popular but challenging task. Several methods exist to address this problem. Notably, the adversarial-based data augmentation method, which aims to directly learn the distribution of minority classes unlike simple data modification, has been applied to the challenging task. While effective, the method focuses on a certain domain and lacks universality, and the generated samples lack diversity due to the mode collapse of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). In this paper, we propose a general framework of data augmentation using GANs in feature space for imbalanced classification. The core of the framework comprises conditional mixture WGANs (cMWGANs), which are used to approximate true feature distribution and generate label preserved and diverse features for the minority class of various datasets. We conduct three experiments on SVHN, FER2013, and Amazon Review of Instant Video to demonstrate the versatility of the framework and better performance of our cMWGANs in single feature learning.

There are systems for hotel reservations, restaurant guides, systems for travel and timetable information, as well as systems for automatic telephone-banking services. Building the different components of a spoken dialogue system and combining them in an optimal way such that a reasonable dialogue becomes possible is a complex task because during the course of a dialogue, the system has to deal with uncertain information. In this thesis, we use statistical methods to model and combine the system\u2019s components. Statistical methods provide a well-founded theory for modeling systems where decisions have to be made under uncertainty. Starting from Bayes\u2019 decision rule, we define and evaluate various statistical models for these components, which comprise speech recognition, natural language understanding, and dialogue management. The problem of natural language understanding is described as a special machine translation problem where a source sentence is translated into a formal language target sentence consisting of concepts. For this, we define and evaluate two models. The first model is a generative model based on the source-channel paradigm. Because the word context plays an important role in natural language understanding tasks, we use a phrasebased translation system in order to take local context dependencies into account. The second model is a direct model based on the maximum entropy framework and works similar to a tagger. For the direct model, we define several feature functions that capture dependencies between words and concepts. Both methods have the advantage that only source-target pairs in the form of input-output sentences must be provided for training. Thus, there is no need to generate grammars manually, which significantly reduces the costs of building dialogue systems for new domains. Furthermore, we propose and investigate a framework based on minimum error rate training that results in a tighter coupling between speech recognition and language understanding. This framework allows for an easy integration of multiple knowledge sources by minimizing the overall error criterion. Thus, it is possible to add language understanding features to the speech recognition framework and thus to minimize the word error rate, or to add speech recognition features to the language understanding framework and thus to minimize the slot error rate. Finally, we develop a task-independent dialogue manager using trees as the fundamental data structure. Based on a cost function, the dialogue manager chooses the next dialogue action with minimal costs. The design and the task-independence of the dialogue manager leads to a strict separation of a given application and the operations performed by the dialogue manager, which simplifies porting an existing dialogue system to a new domain. We report results from a field test in which the dialogue manager was able to choose the optimal dialogue action in 90% of the decisions. We investigate techniques for error handling based on confidence measures defined for speech recognition and language understanding. Furthermore, we investigate the overall performance of the dialogue system when confidence measures from speech recognition and natural language understanding are incorporated into the dialogue strategy.

In this study, dimensional analysis is applied to identify the effective parameters on estimating the velocity at limit of deposition followed by ELM to predict the parameter values.

In our conference paper, we have developed a social influence model, named Socialized Gaussian Process (SGP), for socialized human behavior modeling. Instead of explicitly modeling social influence as individuals' behaviors influenced by their friends' previous behaviors, SGP models the dynamic social correlation as the result of social influence. The SGP model naturally incorporates personal behavior factor and social correlation factor (i.e., the homophily principle: Friends tend to perform similar behaviors) into a unified model. And it models the social influence factor (i.e., an individual's behavior can be affected by his/her friends) implicitly in dynamic social correlation schemes. The detailed experimental evaluation has shown the SGP model achieves better prediction accuracy compared with most of baseline methods. However, a Socialized Random Forest model may perform better at the beginning compared with the SGP model. One of the main reasons is the dynamic social correlation function is purely based on the users' sequential behaviors without considering other physical activity-related features. To address this issue, we further propose a novel \"multi-feature SGP model\" (mfSGP) which improves the SGP model by using multiple physical activity-related features in the dynamic social correlation learning.

However, most of existing methods for network embedding merely focus on preserving the first and second order proximities between nodes, and the important properties of node centrality are neglected. Various centrality measures such as Degree, Closeness, Betweenness, Eigenvector and PageRank centralities have been designed to measure the importance of individual nodes. In this paper, we focus on a novel yet unsolved problem that aims to learn low-dimensional continuous nodes representations that not only preserve the network structure, but also keep the centrality information. We propose a generalizable model, namely GraphCSC, that utilizes both linkage information and centrality information to learn low-dimensional vector representations for network vertices. The learned embeddings by GraphCSC are able to preserve different centrality information of nodes. In addition, we further propose GraphCSC-M, a more comprehensive model that can preserve different centrality information simultaneously through learning multiple centrality-specific embeddings, and a novel attentive multi-view learning approach is developed to compress multiple embeddings of one node into a compact vector representation.

An infinite HCRF is an HCRF with a countably infinite number of hidden states, which rids us not only of the necessity to specify a priori a fixed number of hidden states available but also of the problem of overfitting. Markov chain Monte Carlo MCMC sampling algorithms are often employed for inference in such models. However, convergence of such algorithms is rather difficult to verify, and as the complexity of the task at hand increases, the computational cost of such algorithms often becomes prohibitive. These limitations can be overcome by variational techniques. In this paper, we present a generalized framework for infinite HCRF models, and a novel variational inference approach on a model based on coupled Dirichlet Process Mixtures, the HCRF---DPM.

Experimental results based on the Movie lens dataset show that the proposed system only by smoothening provides more than 95% accuracy for existing users in the highly sparse data.

Automated gender estimation algorithms are mainly based on extracting representative features from face images. In this work we study gender estimation based on information deduced jointly from face and body, extracted from single-shot images. The approach addresses challenging settings such as low-resolution-images, as well as settings when faces are occluded. Specifically the face-based features include local binary patterns (LBP) and scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) features, projected into a PCA space. The features of the novel body-based algorithm proposed in this work include continuous shape information extracted from body silhouettes and texture information retained by HOG descriptors. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are used for classification for body and face features.

Knowledge of the extent and consequences of this disturbance is limited because large-scale distributions of seabed fauna are not well known. We map faunal distributions in the Australian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and quantify the proportion of their abundance that occurs in areas 1) that are directly trawled and 2) where legislation permanently prohibits trawling\u2014defined as percentage exposure or protection, respectively. Our approach includes developing a method that integrates data from disparate seabed surveys to spatially expand predicted benthos distributions. ::: ::: Location ::: Australia. ::: ::: Methods ::: We collate data from 18 seabed surveys to map the distribution of seabed invertebrates (benthos) in nine regions. Our approach combines data from multiple surveys, groups taxa within taxonomic classes and uses Random Forests to predict spatial abundance distributions of benthos groups from environmental variables. Exposure and protection of benthos groups were quantified by mapping their predicted abundance distributions against the footprint of trawling and legislated boundaries of marine reserves and fishery closures. ::: ::: Results ::: Trawling is currently prohibited from more area of Australia's EEZ (58%) than is trawled (<5%). Across 134 benthos groups, 96% had greater protection of abundance than exposure. The mean trawl exposure of benthos-group abundance was 7%, compared to mean protection of 38%, whereas the mean abundance neither trawled nor protected was 55%. Fishery closures covered 19% less study area than marine reserves, but overlapped with a higher proportion (5% more) of benthos-group abundance. ::: ::: Main Conclusions ::: This study provides the most extensive quantitative assessment of the current exposure of Australia's benthos to trawling. Further, it highlights the contribution of fishery closures to marine conservation. These results help identify regions and taxa that are at greatest potential risk from trawling and support managers to achieve balance between conservation and sustainable industries in marine ecosystems.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1111/ddi.12622", "venue": null, "journal": "Diversity and Distributions", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2753348643", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["87448104", "89141", "84978895", "24154903", "11347001", "23862078", "85795280", "154777734", "86033260", "55615898", "86460963", "11347942", "18261168", "28421973", "14517062", "5730041", "83245511", "7800663", "38141667", "86359821", "56380963", "53613844", "128812364", "54642782", "83860989", "55344093", "16508346", "85145718", "29150840", "16405033", "86711218", "53399441", "126555144"], "inbound_citations": ["90305891", "212856306"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55194531"}

In this paper we introduce a framework for hierarchical multitask learning (HMTL) with two levels of tasks such that each super-task, i.e., task at the top level, is itself a multitask learning problem over sub-tasks. For climate projections, each super-task focuses on projections of specific climate variables spatially using an MTL formulation. For the proposed HMTL approach, a group lasso regularization is added to couple parameters across the super-tasks, which in the climate context helps exploit relationships among the behavior of different climate variables at a given spatial location. We show that some recent works on MTL based on learning task dependency structures can be viewed as special cases of HMTL. Experiments on synthetic and real climate data show that HMTL produces better results than decoupled MTL methods applied separately on the super-tasks and HMTL significantly outperforms baselines for climate projection.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": "1701.08840", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2952870519,2963049093,2584885652", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["27643075", "7004602", "8431734", "10050749", "2696348", "127555299", "12817931", "9494747", "5681609", "1326449", "836402", "51583558", "13439084", "53866276", "5626012", "16926932", "6162124", "12705903", "18237764"], "inbound_citations": ["201685541", "51608299", "91187207", "31270673", "52472785"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18239475"}

Up to now, the amount of studies focusing on automatic annotation of non-manual gestures in sign language videos have been limited (e.g. Metaxas et al., 2012). Therefore, in this work we study methods for automatic estimation of three head pose angles and the state of facial elements (eyebrow position, eye openness, and mouth state). The estimation methods we propose are incorporated in our publicly available SLMotion software package (Karppa et al., 2014) for sign language video processing and analysis. Head pose can be described by the three angles: yaw, pitch, and roll (Figure 1a). We propose an approach for head pose estimation from images based on two kinds of visual features. The first group of features is formed by the set of facial landmark points extracted using the flandmark software library (U\u0159ica\u0159 et al., 2012). Secondly, as novel additional features we use a tonal segmentation mask of skin-like colors within the face bounding box. The roll angle is estimated using a geometric approach based on the location of the eye landmarks. The yaw and pitch angles are estimated with separate Support Vector Regression (Smola and Scholkopf, 2004) classifiers. The classifiers are trained using the full set of features extracted from a subset of 684 annotated images from the Pointing04 image database (Gourier et al., 2004) of subjects performing various head poses. In the image subset, the pose varies from \u221245\u25e6 to +45\u25e6 in yaw and from \u221230\u25e6 to +30\u25e6 in pitch, with 15\u25e6 steps from one pose to another. The performance of the proposed head pose estimation method was evaluated in two experimental settings. In the first series of experiments a separate subset of the Pointing04 data was used to measure the accuracy of the trained yaw and pitch regressors. In these experiments, our accuracy levels compare favorably with published results on the same data. Some of the observed advantage might be due to the use of only near frontal pose angles in our evaluation. Roll detection was not evaluated as the Pointing04 database does not include reference annotations for roll. In the second experiment continuous signing was recorded both by a video camera and motion capture equipment (Figure 2). The pose angles were estimated from video frames and the estimates compared with the ground truth values from the motion capture recording. In this experiment the estimated angles for yaw and roll had a very high correlation with the ground truth, whereas for pitch the correlation was slightly lower. We conclude that our video-based estimators are very well comparable with motion capture measurements. The method we propose for estimating eyebrow position, eye openness, and mouth state is based on the construction of an extended set of facial landmarks (Figure 1b). These estimate the position of eyebrows, eyelids, and upper and lower lip boundaries which are not part of the flandmark output. The detection of extended landmarks is initialized by using the flandmark set for coarse location identification of facial elements. The proposed landmark detection method then employs an ensemble of techniques for each facial element: oriented projections and pixel similarity for eyebrows, oriented projections and radial transform for eyes, and pseudo-hue mask for lips. We also consider landmarks detected using the recently presented appearance-based Supervised Descent Method that is implemented in the IntraFace software package (Human Sensing Laboratory and Affect Analysis Group, 2013). The extended landmarks are used to calculate a set of geometric features which are further postprocessed with Principal Component Analysis. The processed features function as input to statistical classifiers trained to produce quantized estimates of eyebrow position, eye openness, and mouth state (Table 1). We evaluated the performance of our facial element state estimators in a quantitative and qualitative type of experiments. For the first experiment set we manually annotated the facial states in videos taken from the SUVI dictionary of Finnish Sign Language (Suvi, 2003). The annotations were performed frame-by-frame on basis of the visual appearance of the isolated frame, without regard to linguistic significance of the face states. We evaluated our automatic estimators against the manual annotations using the Mathews\u2019 Correlation Coefficient (Powers, 2011). In the experiments (Figure 3), eye openness and vertical mouth state estimators had high correlations with the ground truth. The eyebrow position and horizontal mouth state estimators were quite noisy, often missing subtle changes and being sensitive to small variations in head pose. For the qualitative set of experiments we employed annotations prepared for a subset of the SUVI material in an earlier work (Jantunen, 2007) from the point of view of linguistic significance. In the evaluation example (Figure 3), the automatic estimations correctly detected blinks and squints with few mislabeled frames.

Thus novel sense detection becomes a crucial and challenging task in order to build any natural language processing application which depends on the efficient semantic representation of words. With the recent availability of large amounts of digitized texts, automated analysis of language evolution has become possible. Given corpus from two different time periods, the main focus of our work is to detect the words evolved with a novel sense precisely. We pose this problem as a binary classification task to detect whether a new sense of a target word has emerged. This paper presents a unique proposal based on network features to improve the precision of this task of detecting emerged new sense of a target word. For a candidate word where a new sense has been detected by comparing the sense clusters induced at two different time periods, we further compare the network properties of the subgraphs induced from novel sense clusters across these two time periods. Using the mean fractional change in edge density, structural similarity and average path length as features in a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, manual evaluation gives precision values of 0.86 and 0.74 for the task of new sense detection, when tested on 2 distinct time-point pairs, in comparison to the precision values in the range of 0.23-0.32, when the proposed scheme is not used. The outlined method can, therefore, be used as a new post-hoc step to improve the precision of novel word sense detection in a robust and reliable way where the underlying framework uses a graph structure.

Similarity plays an important role in clustering scRNA-seq data. Existing similarity measurements are mainly based on local distance information that is calculated between directly connected node pairs, or shared nearest neighbours' information, without considering the global information. Therefore, these similarity measurements may be not very accurate based on the insufficient information. Based on multi-kernel indices in a global feature space and path-based similarity, we proposed a new similarity measurement for single-cell clustering, called multi-kernel and path-based global similarity (MPGS). In MPGS, global information was incorporated by a new feature space from Spearman correlation coefficient, and a global similarity matrix calculated by multi-kernel. A path-based similarity metric was designed to expand the relevant node range. Based on this similaritiy, a modified Louvain community detection method was applied to cluster the scRNA-seq data, named MPGS-Louvain. To validate the performance of MPGS, the clustering performances of several clustering methods combined with different similarity measurements were compared. To demonstrate the performance of MPGS-Louvain, we compared MPGS-Louvain and five scRNA-seq clustering methods on twenty scRNA-seq datasets. The experimental results showed that MPGS outperformed other similarity measurements, and MPGS-Louvain achieved better performance on these datasets.

The identified prototypes, also called bags of mines, will be used to map the alarms to a feature space that improves the discrimination between mines and clutter objects.

It encourages the model to learn more discriminative features from visual similar classes, leading to faster convergence and better performance.

Edge details are usually blurred since spatial information is difficult to preserve. In light of this, we propose a novel Spatially Constrained Generative Adversarial Network (SCGAN), which decouples the spatial constraints from the latent vector and makes these constraints feasible as additional controllable signals. To enhance the spatial controllability, a generator network is specially designed to take a semantic segmentation, a latent vector and an attribute-level label as inputs step by step. Besides, a segmentor network is constructed to impose spatial constraints on the generator.

Given a collection of data points with observations, quantities of interest may refer to the concentration of a particular mineral in a soil volume, concentration of pollutants within an area, incidence/ prevalence of a particular disease, or susceptibility to a particular kind of natural or hazard, and the corresponding risk. Gaussian process techniques are probabilistic techniques commonly applied to prediction of continuous target values. This is due to analytical tractability of expressions involved in inference, with observations interpreted as an incomplete realization of a Gaussian process defined on the space of data points, transformed by a Gaussian noise process. In order to explain discrete target values, the assumption of a non-Gaussian process acting on the prior Gaussian process is introduced, resulting in intractable expressions. Consequently, classification problems have to be dealt with in a different (in general, more involving) way. Aim of this work is an investigation of the applicability of Gaussian process classification techniques to prediction of categorical variables (classification) of spatial data on regional scale, focusing on occurence of mass movements (earth movements, snow avalanches). This is achieved by qualitative and quantitative evaluation, indicating predictive performance (sensitivity) comparable to the predictive performance (sensitivity) of the Support Vector Machine (SVM), with potential to improve decision support resulting from uncertainty estimates provided by Gaussian process techniques.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2185508537", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:35277045"}

In this study, a total of 27 experiments were performed with different cut parameter combinations to provide sufficient data at the level at which the parameters could determine the effect on product quality. Spatter field formed in uncontrolled diffused and complex shapes during cutting were calculated using image processing technique. The data obtained as a result of the measurements were modeled by using a new modeling method called Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict hole diameter, taper angle and spatter forming area on the fiber laser drilled surface. The estimation models of ELM were compared with ANN models. When both methods are compared in terms of modeling performances of training and test phases, it is found that ELM method performs faster than ANN method and shows higher performance with smaller error margin.

Currently, these disorders are diagnosed using specific clinical diagnostic criteria and neuropsychological examinations. The use of several Machine Learning algorithms to build automated diagnostic models using low-level linguistic features resulting from verbal utterances could aid diagnosis of patients with probable AD from a large population. For this purpose, we developed different Machine Learning models on the DementiaBank language transcript clinical dataset, consisting of 99 patients with probable AD and 99 healthy controls.ResultsOur models learned several syntactic, lexical, and n-gram linguistic biomarkers to distinguish the probable AD group from the healthy group. In contrast to the healthy group, we found that the probable AD patients had significantly less usage of syntactic components and significantly higher usage of lexical components in their language. Also, we observed a significant difference in the use of n-grams as the healthy group were able to identify and make sense of more objects in their n-grams than the probable AD group. As such, our best diagnostic model significantly distinguished the probable AD group from the healthy elderly group with a better Area Under the Receiving Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC) using the Support Vector Machines (SVM).ConclusionsExperimental and statistical evaluations suggest that using ML algorithms for learning linguistic biomarkers from the verbal utterances of elderly individuals could help the clinical diagnosis of probable AD. We emphasise that the best ML model for predicting the disease group combines significant syntactic, lexical and top n-gram features. However, there is a need to train the diagnostic models on larger datasets, which could lead to a better AUC and clinical diagnosis of probable AD.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5237556", "pubmed_id": "28088191", "doi": "10.1186/s12859-016-1456-0", "venue": "BMC Bioinformatics", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2576151354", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["205669301", "8239724", "20276586", "12430024", "16397887", "821542", "1190844", "16428893", "215214600", "26525641", "35432122", "14453640", "205669512", "6787660", "18301424", "19465708", "8820474", "31414174", "2677498", "7356809", "205669484", "206160801", "83853127", "215637071", "10451839", "41055093", "207738654", "1268025", "17342618", "25504154", "11495042", "535858", "15557187", "824642", "36544389", "41814936", "22739488", "3224368", "5133576", "40536108", "577580", "13861754", "13952689", "10511727", "1770094", "1575413", "18858479", "12573207", "38285835", "38569593", "43782663", "41400443", "18278636", "45410318", "12744438"], "inbound_citations": ["21730483", "46956318", "215598462", "201656862", "210888693", "52884754", "210194423", "199880024", "4947959", "4403535", "202893987", "210967351", "215500346", "24404221", "210171363", "4533004", "212565547"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12857814"}

Over the past years, many different successful saliency models have been proposed especially for image saliency prediction. However, these models generally do not consider the dynamic nature of the scenes, and hence, they work better on static images. To date, there has been relatively little work on dynamic saliency that deals with predicting where humans look at videos. In addition, previous studies showed that how the feature integration is carried out is very crucial for more accurate results. Yet, many dynamic saliency models follow a similar simple design and extract separate spatial and temporal saliency maps which are then integrated together to obtain the final saliency map. In this paper, we present a comparative study for different feature integration strategies in dynamic saliency estimation. We employ a number of low and high-level visual features such as static saliency, motion, faces, humans and text, some of which have not been previously used in dynamic saliency estimation. In order to explore the strength of feature integration strategies, we investigate four learning-based (SVM, Gradient Boosting, NNLS, Random Forest) and two transformation-based (Mean, Max) fusion methods, resulting in six new dynamic saliency models. Our experimental analysis on two different dynamic saliency benchmark datasets reveal that our models achieve better performance than the individual features.

The training ratio was varied in the proportion of 60-20-20, 40-30-30 and 20-40-40 to obtain higher classification accuracy. Based on the performance result, GRBK and ERBK kernels are capable of classifying datasets at hand accurately with the best specificity and sensitivity values. From the study, the SVM model with GRBF and ERBF kernels are the best suited for call algorithm data at hand in terms of best specificity and sensitivity values, followed by the RBF kernel.

This paper is concerned with applications of a dual Neural Network (NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to prediction and analysis of beta barrel trans membrane proteins. The prediction and analysis of beta barrel proteins usually offer a host of challenges to the research community, because of their low presence in genomes. Current beta barrel prediction methodologies present intermittent misclassifications resulting in mismatch in the number of membrane spanning regions within amino-acid sequences.To address the problem, this research embarks upon a NN technique and its comparison with hybrid-two-level NN-SVM methodology to classify inter-class and intra-class transitions to predict the number and range of beta membrane spanning regions. The methodology utilizes a sliding-window-based feature extraction to train two different class transitions entitled symmetric and asymmetric models. In symmetric modelling, the NN and SVM frameworks train for sliding window over the same intra-class areas such as inner-to-inner, membrane(beta)-to-membrane and outer-to-outer. In contrast, the asymmetric transition trains a NN-SVM classifier for inter-class transition such as outer-to-membrane (beta) and membrane (beta)-to-inner, inner-to-membrane and membrane-to-outer. For the NN and NN-SVM to generate robust outcomes, the prediction methodologies are analysed by jack-knife tests and single protein tests.

Current deep learning methods often rely on loss functions used widely in the task of face recognition, e.g., contrastive loss and triplet loss. These loss functions have the problem of hard negative mining. In this paper, a robust, effective, and gait-related loss function, called angle center loss (ACL), is proposed to learn discriminative gait features. The proposed loss function is robust to different local parts and temporal window sizes. Different from center loss which learns a center for each identity, the proposed loss function learns multiple sub-centers for each angle of the same identity. Only the largest distance between the anchor feature and the corresponding cross-view sub-centers is penalized, which achieves better intra-subject compactness. We also propose to extract discriminative spatial\u2013temporal features by local feature extractors and a temporal attention model. A simplified spatial transformer network is proposed to localize the suitable horizontal parts of the human body. Local gait features for each horizontal part are extracted and then concatenated as the descriptor. We introduce long short-term memory (LSTM) units as the temporal attention model to learn the attention score for each frame, e.g., focusing more on discriminative frames and less on frames with bad quality.

Moreover, nonnegative matrix factorization is also a popular way to represent the data samples. In addition, contextual similarity learning has also been studied and proven to be an effective method for the ranking problem. However, these technologies have never been used together.

In recent years the development of new molecular genetics technologies, such as DNA microarrays led to the simultaneous measurement of expression levels of thousands and even tens of thousands of genes. Microarray gene expression technology has facilitated the study of genomic structure and investigation of biological systems. Numerical output of this technology is shown as microarray gene expression data sets. These data sets contain a very large number of genes and a relatively small number of samples and their precise analysis requires a robust and suitable computer software. Due to this, only a few existing algorithms are applicable to them, so more efficient methods for solving clustering, gene selection and classification problems of gene expression data sets are required and those methods need to be computationally applicable and less expensive. The aim of this thesis is to develop new algorithms for solving clustering, gene selection and data classification problems on gene expression data sets. Clustering in gene expression data sets is a challenging problem. The increasing use of DNA microarray-based tumour gene expression profiles for cancer diagnosis requires more efficient methods to solve clustering problems of these profiles. Different algorithms for clustering of genes have been proposed, however few algorithms can be applied to the clustering of samples. k-means algorithm, among very few clustering algorithms is applicable to microarray gene expression data sets, however these are not efficient for solving clustering problems when the number of genes is thousands and this algorithm is very sensitive to the choice of a starting point. Additionally, when the number of clusters is relatively large, this algorithm gives local minima which can differ significantly from the global solution.

{"paper_id": "59676293", "title": "Finding Genes Related to Disease Using Statistical Learning", "authors": [{"first": "Benjamin", "middle": ["Alan"], "last": "Goldstein", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "This dissertation consists of the analyses of three separate genetic association datasets. Each represents a unique data structure with a different question of interest that therefore require distinct approaches and methodologies. As such, the three substantive chapters (2-4) can each stand on their own. However, the over-arching question in each of these studies is the same: which genes (or genetic material) are related to the disease or outcome being studied. Moreover, while the methodologies are each distinct, they all incorporate statistical learning methodologies to obtain some modicum of inference.Study 1 - As computational power has improved the application of statistical learning algorithms to finding SNPs related to disease has become more ubiquitous. The hope is that these algorithms will be more capable than typical marginal testing in detecting SNPs with higher order effects. The Random Forests (RF) algorithm is one such algorithm that has seen increased use with genetic data. As part of its output, RF ranks the predictor variables (SNPs) on their relative importance.The present study represents the first application of the RF algorithm to Genome Wide Association (GWA) data and investigates how best to use the algorithm for this unique data structure. A multiple sclerosis (MS) GWA data set is used for the analysis. Results indicate the typical tuning parameter settings need to be adjusted for the high degree of sparsity in the data. Furthermore, most meaningful results were obtained when both unimportant and overly important SNPs were removed. RF was able to replicate some previous findings using the same data. Moreover, four genes not previously associated with MS were identified.Study 2 - In many analyses, one has data on one level but desires to draw inference on another level. For example, in genetic association studies, one observes units of DNA referred to as SNPs, but wants to determine whether genes that are comprised of SNPs are associated with disease. While there are some available approaches for addressing this issue, they usually involve making parametric assumptions and are not easily generalizable. A statistical test is proposed for testing the association of a set of variables with an outcome of interest. No assumptions are made about the functional form relating the variables to the outcome. A general function is fit using any statistical learning algorithm, with the SuperLearner algorithm suggested. The parameter of interest is the cross-validated risk and this is compared to an expected risk. A Wald test is proposed using the influence curve of the cross-validated risk to obtain the variance. It is shown both theoretically and via simulation that the test maintains appropriate type I error control and is more powerful than parametric tests under more general alternatives. The test is applied to an MS candidate gene study. Three separate analyses are performed highlighting the flexibility of the approach. Study 3 - Secondary analyses, such as Gene Ontology and Motif analysis, have become central components of gene expression experiments, allowing researchers to derive biological understanding from the set of genes that are differentially expressed. An important statistical task is determining which genes should be passed on to such programs and how the genes should be grouped for analysis. The typical approach is to cluster the set of differentially expressed genes, and pass these clusters on to the secondary analyses. However, many expression experiments have specific hypotheses which allow one to analyze the genes and group them in a more targeted approach. To illustrate the utility of being more specific, a gene expression study of C. elegans is used where a particular outcome was observed and hoped to be explained. A generalmodel is fit and analyzed to estimate the parameters corresponding to the specific hypothesis, leading to four natural groupings of the differentially expressed genes. These groupings lead to meaningful results in the secondary analyses that allow for the biologist to make robust hypotheses that are experimentally confirmed. It is shown that a traditional approach would not have yielded such robust findings.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "110893188", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["35645598", "205546079", "18979156", "10012238", "14335577", "25744154", "88513922", "4768585", "5135667", "33235408", "43816468", "32810785", "1965962", "25282737", "205097791", "23483771", "7938339", "21870372", "75965899", "23503825", "21390500", "660729", "16573678", "931877", "2692450", "1121527", "28490261", "21029222", "22453124", "31245539", "18401995", "25130161", "36331778", "145687811", "88513922", "16664547"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59676293"}

Its goal is achieved by hiding secret messages into innocuous objects such as digital images, audio files, etc. As any other technology, steganography can be used for malicious purpose. The need to detect steganographic objects give rise to steganalysis, a complementary task to steganography. The main focus of this dissertation is on steganalysis of JPEG images, as the JPEG image format is nowadays the most frequently used image format. ::: In the first part of the dissertation, a detector recognizing six popular steganographic algorithms is presented. This detector is novel in many ways. First, it not only detects the presence of a secret message, but also assigns the image to a class according to the algorithm used to embed the message. Second, it detects stego content in single-compressed as well as in double-compressed JPEG images. Third, it offers superior accuracy in comparison to prior art. ::: The detector is based on feature extraction and supervised training of two banks of multi-classifiers implemented by Support Vector Machines. The first bank targeted to single-compressed images contains a separate multi-classifier trained for each JPEG quality factor from a certain range. Another bank of multi-classifiers is trained for double-compressed images for the same range of primary quality factors. Multi-classifier banks are preceded by a pre-classifier detecting double-compression and estimating the primary quantization table. ::: The second part of the dissertation presents a method for benchmarking security of steganographic algorithms. We argue that a good benchmark should be dependent only on the model chosen to represent cover and stego objects (feature set). While the KL divergence would be a preferable measure, because it is a fundamental quantity, there are practical difficulties in computing it. Therefore a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) is proposed as a measure of steganographic security, because it is well understood theoretically, and is numerically stable even in high-dimensional spaces.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2299652559", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["41879612", "18716510", "7930968", "5603605", "17513833", "49275213", "9232655", "17134808", "30168102", "212430219"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:14981996"}

For efficient pain level detection, we have mapped the deformation parameters to higher discriminative space using Distance Metric Learning (DML) method.

Even experienced radiologists find it difficult to identify the subtle characteristics with which FCD lesions are displayed in MR images. Unfortunately, because of this reason, many patients do not even receive proper treatment for FCD as doctors declare their MRIs as negative (normal). A computerized approach using the MRI image can reliably detect these lesions. In earlier approaches it was shown that an analysis of MRI data has the potential to detect FCD and hence whether medically intractable partial epilepsy is present or not. In this paper, a novel and hybrid algorithm MCS (a combination of Morphological Operations, weighted K-Means Clustering and Support Vector Machine) has been proposed to detect and analyze the lesional structures in MR images.

In the absence of paired images, i2i translation is tackled with one or multiple domain transformations (i.e., CycleGAN, StarGAN etc.). In this paper, we study a new problem, that of image-to-image translation, under a set of continuous parameters that correspond to a model describing a physical process. In particular, we propose the SliderGAN which transforms an input face image into a new one according to the continuous values of a statistical blendshape model of facial motion. We show that it is possible to edit a facial image according to expression and speech blendshapes, using sliders that control the continuous values of the blendshape model.

Second, three feature selection algorithms are compared: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Relief-F, and Sequential Forward Floating Search (SFFS), and the most effective of the three chosen. In this study, the SFFS algorithm showed higher accuracy than the others.

Classic strategic control of water withdrawal from water reservoir are based mainly on the rules and rules curves, which are created by generalization of historical data of water inflows to the reservoirs and water demand. Discharge series are changing in the time due to expected climate change. It is necessary to looking for intelligent water withdrawal control, which will allow to react on these hydrological changes and contribute to the efficient use of accumulated water for ensure water demand. The paper will describe the algorithm based on adaptive control. The normal adaptive control required knowledge of the water flow medium-term prediction into the reservoir. The created algorithm of intelligent water withdrawal control does not require knowledge of hydrological predictions. This control method is based on a suitable combination optimization method with the Support vector machines method. The control algorithm is one of the possible measures to mitigate the negative impacts of droughts and water scarcity. The algorithm of adaptive control is applied to the control of water withdrawal from selected single-reservoir.

First, all these three dimensional (3D) MRI images were preprocessed with atlas-registered normalization. Then, gray matter images were extracted and the 3D images were under-sampled. Afterwards, principle component analysis was applied for feature extraction. In total, 20 principal components (PC) were extracted from 3D MRI data using singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm, and 2 PCs were extracted from additional information (consisting of demographics, clinical examination, and derived anatomic volumes) using alternating least squares (ALS).

The system architecture is designed in such a way that the ml models can train and deploy in a real-time interval by retrieving the data from IBM Cloud and the cloud information can also be accessed through CPMS in a requested time interval. To help the doctors, the ml models will predict the condition of a patient. If the prediction based on the condition gets worse, the CPMS will send an SMS to the duty doctor and nurse for getting immediate attention to the patient. Combining with the ml models and mobile application, the project may serve as a smart healthcare solution for the hospitals.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICOEI.2019.8862754", "venue": "2019 3rd International Conference on Trends in Electronics and Informatics (ICOEI)", "journal": "2019 3rd International Conference on Trends in Electronics and Informatics (ICOEI)", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2979907350", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["70693817", "11453744", "38910801", "17492183", "14199397", "86766764", "85529983", "9957246", "47061193", "1328709", "18129236", "32800624", "4583977", "11933690", "29321592", "16154154", "9235100", "61568722", "150290167", "632197", "7317448", "129258567", "856717", "55267860", "12394453", "96077227"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204230630"}

In this article, we overcome this challenge by using synthetic samples and proposing semisupervised variational generative adversarial networks (GANs). In contrast to conditional GAN (previously used for the generation of HSI samples), the proposed approach has two novel aspects. First, an encoder-decoder network is extended to the semisupervised context using an ensemble prediction technique. Through this technique, our deep generative model can be trained using limited labeled samples (only five samples per class) with a large number of unlabeled samples. Second, we build a collaborative relationship between the generation network and the classification network. This property enables that our model can produce meaningful samples that can contribute to the final classification. The experiments on four benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve an increase of $>$10% in overall classification accuracy compared with the baseline model without using the generated sample. We also show that the proposed model can achieve better and more robust performance for HSI classification than other generative methods as well as semisupervised methods, especially when the labeled data are limited.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1109/JSTARS.2020.2974577", "venue": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "journal": "IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "3008920213", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["10862618", "21495356", "107750136", "21747372", "23860233", "34475894", "25516373", "59076046", "6906514", "206420153", "2747621", "13480175", "62762483", "16775850", "22732153", "4625574", "125579412", "49302742", "37336258", "11707694", "21648458", "44935336", "1033682", "52112233", "42273056", "152282365", "12803511", "1099052", "2349418", "85531885", "8758543", "206771102", "13123084", "1687220", "122113586", "123004626", "15638863", "104293136", "3754543", "43846694"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213359777"}

Accordingly, the MSFD prescribes a monitoring of this biotope by the member states of the EU. In the German North Sea, however, the distribution and spatial extent of this biotope as well as the structuring of its benthic species inventory is unknown. We used an extensive geo-referenced dataset on occurrence, abundance and biomass of the benthic infauna of the south-eastern North Sea to estimate the distribution of the biotope and to characterize the associated infauna assemblages. Sediment preferences of the burrowing megafauna, comprising decapod crustaceans and echiurids, were identified and the core distribution areas of the burrowing megafauna were modelled using Random Forests. Clusters of benthic infauna inside the core distribution areas were identified by fuzzy clustering. The burrowing megafauna occurred on a wide range of sediments with varying mud contents. The core distribution area of the burrowing megafauna was characterized by elevated mud content and a water depth of 25\u201355 m. The analysis of the benthic communities and their relation to sedimentological conditions identified four infauna clusters of slightly varying species composition.

We investigate this issue by proposing a learning strategy that aims to minimize the user's workload by taking into account the flow of the questions.

Traditional methods for drift compensation are laborious and costly due to the frequent acquisition and labeling process for gases samples recalibration. Extreme learning machines (ELMs) have been confirmed to be efficient and effective learning techniques for pattern recognition and regression. However, ELMs primarily focus on the supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning problems in single domain (i.e. source domain). To our best knowledge, ELM with cross-domain learning capability has never been studied. This paper proposes a unified framework, referred to as Domain Adaptation Extreme Learning Machine (DAELM), which learns a robust classifier by leveraging a limited number of labeled data from target domain for drift compensation as well as gases recognition in E-nose systems, without loss of the computational efficiency and learning ability of traditional ELM. In the unified framework, two algorithms called DAELM-S and DAELM-T are proposed for the purpose of this paper, respectively. In order to percept the differences among ELM, DAELM-S and DAELM-T, two remarks are provided.

Climatologists have identified different oceanic-atmospheric oscillations that seem to influence the behavior of these variables and in turn can be used to extend the forecast lead time. In the absence of a good physical understanding of the linkages between oceanic-atmospheric oscillations and hydrological processes, it is difficult to construct a physical model. An attractive alternative to physically based models are the Artificial Intelligence (AI) type models, also referred to as machine learning or data-driven models. These models do not employ traditional forms of equations common in physically based models, but instead have flexible and adaptive model structures that can extract the relationship from the data. With this motivation this research focuses on increasing the precipitation and streamflow forecast lead times and enhancing the temporal resolution of precipitation within the Colorado River Basin (CRB). An AI-type data-driven model, Support Vector Machine (SVM), was developed incorporating oceanic-atmospheric oscillations to increase the precipitation and streamflow forecast lead times.

Thus, an integrated approach for rangeland degradation risk assessment was designed, consisting of the analysis of vegetation dynamics, driving forces identification and degradation risk prediction. Firstly, Vegetation Indexes and field survey data were applied to build regression model to calculate the vegetation coverage status and trend of change in each grid. Secondly, the important driving forces of rangeland dynamics were identified based on the local knowledge and objective data. Thirdly, Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) was trained in each seasonal rangeland to predict the probability of rangeland degradation in each grid. Rangeland degradation in Burqin County, Xinjiang, China was served as a case to test the practicability of this approach. The results indicated that during 2000 and 2013 most of the rangeland grids remained stable. Twelve factors were identified to be the driving force of the trend of vegetation coverage dynamics. BBNs showed that in most of the study area degradation risk was less than 50%, and the grids facing the maximum risk were only appeared in a small range.

Accordingly, it is important to monitor the condition of roller bearing in various operations for preventing the being damages. The fault types that often occur in the roller bearing are out race flaw, inner race flaw and roller element flaw. Although the theory and method for diagnosing one flaw in the roller bearing have been established, the precise diagnosis method for identifying the locations of multi-flaws in a roller bearing has not been clarified theoretically yet. Therefore, in this study, the method for precisely diagnosing multi-flaws in a roller bearing is proposed as follows: Firstly, it is proved theoretically that the pass frequency used for diagnosing single flaw can be used for diagnosing multi-flaws. Moreover, in order to confirm the accuracy of theory, the spectrum of the artificial envelope waveform for the bearing multi-flaws by simulation is compared with that of the data obtained from experiments. It was found that the pass frequencies caused by the bearing multi-flaws are same in both the cases of theory and the experiments. Secondly, intelligent diagnosis method based on support vector machine (SVM) is proposed for automatic diagnosis. The dedicated symptom parameter are not required when using SVM. This is an advantage when the proposed method is applied for on-line diagnosis. Finally, the sequential diagnosis method is proposed for discriminating the conditions of bearing, such as normal or abnormal, outer race flaw or others, inner race flaw or roller element flaw. The efficiency of the method is verified by practical fault diagnosis of bearings with multi-flaws. The bearings used in the experiments have scratches on race or roller element.

Since the deep learning network structure of HELM is more accurate than the single layer of ELM in feature representation, the dp-HELM is further developed through decomposing the ELM-based Auto-encoders (ELM-AE) of deep hidden layers into a loop of MapReduce jobs. Additionally, the multimode issue is solved through the \u201cdivide and rule\u201d strategy. The distributed and parallel K-means (dp-K-means) is utilized to divide the process modes, which are further trained in a synchronous parallel way by dp-ELM and dp-HELM.

However, GCN faces challenges in flexibility due to the fact of requiring the full graph Laplacian available in the training phase. Moreover, with the depth of layers increases, the computational and memory cost of GCN grows explosively on account of the recursive neighborhood expansion, which leads to a limitation in processing large graphs. To tackle these issues, we take advantage of image processing in agility and present Node2Img, a flexible architecture for large-scale graph learning. Node2Img maps the nodes to\"images\"(i.e. grid-like data in Euclidean space) which can be the inputs of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Instead of leveraging the fixed whole network as a batch to train the model, Node2Img supports a more efficacious framework in practice, where the batch size can be set elastically and the data in the same batch can be calculated parallelly. Specifically, by ranking each node's influence through degree, Node2Img selects the most influential first-order as well as second-order neighbors with central node fusion information to construct the grid-like data. For further improving the efficiency of downstream tasks, a simple CNN-based neural network is employed to capture the significant information from the Euclidean grids. Additionally, the attention mechanism is implemented, which enables implicitly specifying the different weights for neighboring nodes with different influences. Extensive experiments on real graphs' transductive and inductive learning tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed Node2Img model against the state-of-the-art GCN-based approaches.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": "2003.09638", "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "ArXiv", "journal": "ArXiv", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "3012881613", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["3144218", "3507043", "192641055", "3573161", "59316666", "198189993", "210995438", "159042192", "3636539", "22191393", "4755450", "3292002", "50776464", "206593603", "6641909", "207763512", "1430801", "4770492", "153311899", "195874140", "3420288", "1322968", "30721510", "37581869", "13999578", "62016134", "4640611", "6844431", "70293087", "3051291", "10211629", "115452637"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:214612067"}

This paper describes a wrapper forecasting methodology for irradiance time series that combines mutual information and an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), with application to short forecast horizons between 5-min and 3-h ahead. The method is referred to as Wrapper Mutual Information Methodology (WMIM). To evaluate the proposed approach, its performance is compared to that of three dimensionality reduction scenarios: full space (latest 50 variables), partial space (latest 5 variables), and the usual Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Based on measured irradiance data from two arid sites (Madina and Tamanrasset), the present results reveal that the reduction of the historical input space increases the forecasting performance of global solar radiation. In the case of Madina and forecast horizons from 5-min to 30-min ahead, the WMIM forecasts have a better coefficient of determination (R2 between 0.927 and 0.967) than those using the next best performing strategy, PCA (R2 between 0.921 and 0.959).

FAEs have gained importance in biofuel, medicine and food industries due to their capability of acting on a large range of substrates for cleaving ester bonds and synthesizing high-added value molecules through esterification and transesterification reactions. During the past two decades extensive studies have been carried out on the production and partial characterization of FAEs from fungi, while much less is known about FAEs of bacterial or plant origin. Initial classification studies on FAEs were restricted on sequence similarity and substrate specificity on just four model substrates and considered only a handful of FAEs belonging to the fungal kingdom. Results Our study centers on the descriptor-based classification and structural analysis of experimentally verified and putative FAEs. 365 FAE-related sequences of fungal, bacterial and plantae origin were collected and they were clustered using Self Organizing Maps followed by k-means clustering into distinct groups based on amino acid composition and physico-chemical composition descriptors derived from the respective amino acid sequence. Support Vector Machine model was constructed for the classification of 365 FAEs into the pre-assigned clusters and the model successfully recognized 98.2% of the training sequences and all the sequences of the blind test. The underlying functionality of the 12 proposed FAE families was validated against a combination of prediction tools and published experimental data. Another important aspect of the present work involves the development of pharmacophore models for the new FAE families, for which sufficient information on known substrates existed. Conclusions The development of pharmacophore models for specific FAE sub-families will have a huge impact on the application of members of the particular group to completely novel and unexpected substrates. Virtual screening with the developed pharmacophores of chemical and natural compound databases could reveal unique opportunities for FAEs-based-biocatalytic modifications to synthesize compounds with altered or improved medicinal properties. We are confident that the classification and characterization of this expanding super family of enzymes will provide researchers and industries with the toolbox from which to select FAEs for suitable reactions and applications; nevertheless, the framework presented here is applicable to every poorly characterized enzyme family and understanding their structure-function relationships. We welcome interested researchers to submit putative FAE sequences to us for sub-grouping as per the new classification system.

In this context, probabilistic graphical models provide convenient means of encoding p(y|x), particularly for the purpose of minimizing general loss functions. We review the main approaches based on PGMs for multi-label classification (Probabilistic Classifier Chain, Conditional Dependency Network, Bayesian Network Classifier, Conditional Random Field, Sum-Product Network), and propose a generic approach inspired from constraint-based structure learning methods to identify the unique partition of the label set into irreducible label factors (ILFs), that is, the irreducible factorization of p(y|x) into disjoint marginal distributions. We establish several theoretical results to characterize the ILFs based on the compositional graphoid axioms, and obtain three generic procedures under various assumptions about the conditional independence properties of the joint distribution p(x, y). Our conclusions are supported by carefully designed multi-label classification experiments, under the F-loss and the zero-one loss functions.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2761766295,2600698288", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["52968019"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:39897759"}

Second, to compare the ANN methods to the present FY-2C operational algorithm, this study implemented SOM, one of the best ANN network identified from this study, as an automated cloud classification system for the FY-2C multi-channel data. It shows that SOM method has improved the results greatly not only in pixel-level accuracy but also in cloud patch-level classification by more accurately identifying cloud types such as cumulonimbus, cirrus and clouds in high latitude.

This approach integrates models from 2 traditions of hippocampal modeling, those of episodic memory and incremental learning, by drawing on an earlier mathematical model of conditioning, SOP (A.

The model describes how a familiarity signal may arise from parahippocampal cortices, giving a novel explanation for the finding that the neural response to a stimulus in these regions decreases with increasing stimulus familiarity. Recollection is ascribed to the hippocampus proper. It is shown how the properties of episodic representations in the neocortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and hippocampus proper may explain phenomena in classical conditioning. The model reproduces the effects of hippocampal, septal, and broad hippocampal region lesions on contextual modulation of classical conditioning, blocking, learned irrelevance, and latent inhibition.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "16060751", "doi": "10.1037/0033-295X.112.3.560", "venue": "Psychological review", "journal": "Psychological review", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2112951855", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["24888210", "4766196", "1572123", "12367637", "12003374", "23857449", "31388501", "9996400", "142990850", "12513850", "32711450", "11533186", "531967", "10651579", "1845579", "35096359", "145676106", "933785", "19971356", "146606721", "27688976", "24607730", "26489943", "17568117", "12211565", "25285056", "9393030", "493904", "20433947", "142750504", "9330167", "144752813", "34822581", "18259348", "966676", "1577163", "60200307", "7117437", "16933023", "3957170", "584350", "41226093", "198897585", "22136581", "144823969", "140529520", "22274733", "4405566", "21987456", "5669429", "24417983", "2138784", "210222146", "6482631", "44261599", "8595419", "17955262", "64054703", "2166238", "27171766", "14304833", "2832081", "1370246", "25900204", "16585076", "5991645", "146940694", "144319593", "19602092", "994006", "142303615", "4802179", "16979212", "8408273", "25185653", "16577977", "2376781", "3145564", "6483229", "6997636", "10823650", "197656244", "23793536", "8280779", "14415860", "8407974", "9086793", "12236468", "12963547", "7784227", "23824177", "15058578", "26988482", "146715498", "819574", "11640361", "5963040", "9080102", "140817870", "144056156", "142941981", "699985", "10822637", "42400966", "21375145", "6713230", "10705949", "19372182", "69715852", "21824934", "17607840", "10315776", "145694875", "23293900", "17061818"], "inbound_citations": ["3828626", "24276938", "9185393", "2169615", "1339368", "189812979", "11118989", "23880247", "13849877", "2816640", "195853940", "2344902", "14042007", "14441884", "16197997", "572822", "15422457", "16661627", "19026268", "3550083", "210937739", "215706276", "15979655", "43108148", "3859165", "15875481", "72335185", "17089130", "17994791", "9709427", "6265415"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16714295"}

The relevant coefficients of various features to the classification task, measured by real-valued scaling, are estimated efficiently by using GA. And GA exploits heavy-bias operator to promote sparsity in the scaling of features. There are many potential benefits of this method: Feature selection is performed by eliminating irrelevant features whose scaling is zero, an SVM classifier that has enhanced generalization ability can be learned simultaneously. Experimental comparisons using original SVM and GA-SVM demonstrate both economical feature selection and excellent classification accuracy on junk e-mail recognition problem and Internet ad recognition problem. The experimental results show that comparing with original SVM classifier, the number of support vector decreases significantly and better classification results are achieved based on GA-SVM. It also demonstrates that GA can provide a simple, general, and powerful framework for tuning parameters in optimal problem, which directly improves the recognition performance and recognition rate of SVM.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11767-005-0017-x", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Electronics (China)", "mag_id": "181102749", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:118826865"}
